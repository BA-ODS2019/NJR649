In sum, 28 local government areas have made a similar declaration \u2013 but never before in a place such as Wagga, where they <a href=\"https://www.ncca.org.au/about/item/402-church-leaders-promote-national-day-of-prayer-in-time-of-drought\">prayed for rain</a> at the scorching height of the last major drought, and where the local MP is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/28/michael-mccormack-with-steel-in-his-voice-says-hes-confident-of-joyces-support\">deputy prime minister</a>, Michael McCormack, who recently told a constituent he disputed evidence of global heating.</p> <p>Conkey, a former journalist who ran the Riverina Leader community newspaper for 25 years, rejects the suggestion that his support for the emergency declaration might be brave or naive, even as local political attacks are being amped up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rallies and protests are a bit too aggressive for people in this area</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Trudi Beck</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI find it unusual that we should be having this debate in the first place,\u201d Conkey says. \u201cThe debate regarding climate change was done and dusted years ago.

There are a couple of companies who have come out publicly and said they\u2019re seriously concerned about impacts on their business and I\u2019ll be looking at that. But my argument is that if we don\u2019t have a sustainable and resilient community, we won\u2019t have jobs at all.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy, it\u2019s probably not going to be cheap. But we\u2019re trying to mitigate the costs to the community that climate change will bring.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday morning, Conkey\u2019s face appeared on signs plastered around the town centre, along with those of three others who voted for the climate emergency motion, accusing them of selling out ratepayers. A vote to repeal the declaration will be held on Monday night. Progress won\u2019t be won without a fight.</p> <h2><strong>Droughts and flooding rains</strong></h2> <p>In between two major droughts, about 9,000 people were evacuated from Wagga Wagga when the Murrumbidgee river hit a 159-year high, flooding large parts of the city.</p> <p>\u201cThe droughts and flooding rains are part of the mythology of Australia.

Every decade there were droughts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how this is discussed. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say there\u2019s no such thing as climate change. Of course there\u2019s climate change, of course it\u2019s changing.

      "bodyText": "Councils will be expected to take rubbish collection, cleaning and school dinner provision back in-house under plans to reverse four decades of outsourcing to be announced by the Labour party today . In the biggest shake-up of local government since the Margaret Thatcher-inspired reforms of the 1980s, a future Jeremy Corbyn-led government would legislate to ensure that the default option was for the public sector to deliver its own services. Councils spend \u00a380bn on outsourced contracts but Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say it is time to end the \u201cscandal\u201d of the taxpayer being \u201cripped off\u201d by private companies. Under the proposals, councils would be allowed to employ private contractors under tightly controlled conditions, but the presumption would be that they take responsibility for their own services when existing deals expire. The party says it would support councils by providing them with a model contract to save time and resources, access to the government\u2019s legal department to help with contract management, and greater support for collaboration among councillors. The drive to outsource the delivery of local services began in 1980, and the list of services expanded over the next decade to include construction and maintenance, refuse collections, cleaning, school and welfare catering, ground maintenance, and the provision of sports and leisure services. Labour has accepted it would not be possible to eliminate all outsourcing but companies bidding to deliver public services would have to prove they pay fair wages, recognise trade unions and support local labour and supply chains. Details of the scheme will be announced at an event in London by McDonnell and the shadow communities and local government secretary, Andrew Gwynne. The planned reforms are intended to dovetail with Labour\u2019s plans to renationalise the railways, the Royal Mail and the public utilities. Gwynne will say: \u201cOur plan will be the largest set of reforms of local government in generations, rebuilding local government capacity and giving power back to communities \u2013 because public services belong to local people, and people are more important than profit.\u201d Labour will argue that the original justification for outsourcing \u2013 that private companies offer better value for money to taxpayers \u2013 has proved incorrect. It says the collapse of Carillion \u2013 the construction and facilities management company \u2013 in 2018 highlighted the risk of private provision, but that poor service quality and standards go beyond one-off cases. Local councils \u2013 including those in the north London borough of Islington, in Nottingham, Sefton, Halton and Stoke-on-Trent \u2013 have already been bringing services back in-house. Labour is braced for widespread opposition to its local government blueprint. But it says claims that insourcing will place unsustainable cost burdens on councils, will lead to skimping on performance, or will contravene EU law, can be answered. A policy document to be presented at the launch will list seven key attractions of insourcing: Lower costs A public sector ethos Longer time horizons Greater scope for the co-ordination and integration of services Economies of scale Greater accountability and transparency Better management of risk. Labour says its new framework for insourcing won\u2019t require compensation to contractors because councils will wait until contracts are up or lawfully terminated before bringing services back in-house. McDonnell will say: \u201cAfter year upon year of failures the public has rightly lost confidence in the privatisation of our public services and the carve-up of the public realm for private profit. The government\u2019s ideological pursuit of privatisation and outsourcing has seen the public pay the price as fat cat bosses count their profits. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end the outsourcing scandal which has seen private companies rip off the taxpayer, degrade our public services and put people at risk whilst remaining wholly unaccountable to the people who rely on and fund these services.\u201d",

Fars, the semi-official Iranian news agency, reported that it was briefly detained in the strait of Hormuz and given a notice to comply with environmental regulations before being allowed to continue on its way.</p> \n<p>The Mesdar\u2019s Glasgow-based operator, Norbulk Shipping UK, confirmed that the vessel had been boarded by armed guards but had then been allowed to continue its voyage. \u201cAll crew are safe and well,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management confirmed in a statement on Friday that the ship remained uncontactable.</p> \n<p>Stena Impero was in \u201cfull compliance with all navigation and international regulations\u201d when it was intercepted, the company said.</p> \n<p>Stena Bulk chief executive Erik Hanell said: \u201cThere are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality.

On 10 July, a British warship, the HMS Montrose, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/iranian-boats-harass-british-oil-tanker-in-strait-of-hormuz\">intervened to drive off three Iranian military vessels </a>that were attempting to divert a UK tanker, the British Heritage, towards Iranian territory. </p> \n<p>The incidents come amid a battle of nerves along the oil export routes of the Gulf, which has involved close encounters between Iranian, UK and US military forces.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Friday, Tehran denied Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/18/trump-us-warship-iran-drone-strait-of-hormuz\">claim that US forces had downed a Iranian drone</a> over the Gulf. Iran\u2019s top military spokesman said all drones had returned safely to base, but Trump was adamant. \u201cNo doubt about it ... we shot it down,\u201d the US president said.</p> \n<p>Trump said on Thursday that the USS Boxer took defensive action after the unmanned vehicle came within 1,000 metres of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down. </p> \n<p>The prospect of negotiations that might defuse the standoff appeared more distant than ever on Friday as a senior US official dismissed a nuclear offer proposed the previous day by Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, during a visit to New York.

Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms.

      "bodyText": "Iran seized two oil tankers \u2013 one registered in the UK, the other in Liberia \u2013 in the strait of Hormuz on Friday, marking a dramatic escalation in the worsening standoff in the Gulf. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards claimed to have taken the British-flagged Stena Impero into port with its 23-strong crew, and Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations. On Saturday, the semi-official Iranian news agency, Fars, said the ship had been taken to Bandar Abbas port and that the crew remained on the vessel. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s state-run news agency, IRNA, reported that the tanker was seized due to a collision with an Iranian fishing boat. It said the fishing boat informed Iran\u2019s Ports and Maritime Organisation, which notified the Revolutionary Guards. The Stena Impero\u2019s owners however, said the ship had been \u201capproached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter during transit of the strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters\u201d. A second tanker, the Mesdar, which is Liberian-flagged but British operated, also made a sudden diversion from its course towards the Saudi port of Ras Tanura on Friday, and tracking data showed it moving northwards towards the Iranian coast before apparently turning off its tracking signal. Less than two hours later, the Mesdar\u2019s tracking signal was turned back on. Fars, the semi-official Iranian news agency, reported that it was briefly detained in the strait of Hormuz and given a notice to comply with environmental regulations before being allowed to continue on its way. The Mesdar\u2019s Glasgow-based operator, Norbulk Shipping UK, confirmed that the vessel had been boarded by armed guards but had then been allowed to continue its voyage. \u201cAll crew are safe and well,\u201d it said. Stena Bulk and Northern Marine Management confirmed in a statement on Friday that the ship remained uncontactable. Stena Impero was in \u201cfull compliance with all navigation and international regulations\u201d when it was intercepted, the company said. Stena Bulk chief executive Erik Hanell said: \u201cThere are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality. There have been no reported injuries and the safety and welfare of our crew remains our primary focus.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, told Sky News: \u201cWe are absolutely clear that, if this situation is not resolved quickly, there will be serious consequences.\u201d But he added: \u201cWe are not looking at military options, we are looking at a diplomatic way to resolve the situation but we are very clear that it must be resolved.\u201d He said that Stena Impero had been surrounded by four Iranian vessels with a helicopter hovering overhead, while 10 Iranian speedboats had converged on the Mesdar. \u201cThese seizures are unacceptable. It is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region,\u201d Hunt said. Late on Friday night, the British government advised UK ships to stay out of the area \u201cfor an interim period\u201d. \u201cWe remain deeply concerned about Iran\u2019s unacceptable actions which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation,\u201d a government statement said following a meeting of ministers to discuss the incident in the strait of Hormuz. \u201cAs the foreign secretary has said, our response will be considered and robust and there will be serious consequences if the situation is not resolved. \u201cWe remain in close contact with our international partners and there will be further meetings over the weekend.\u201d Donald Trump, the US president, said on Friday night that the US would talk to Britain about the incidents. The Revolutionary Guards said they had seized the Stena Impero, citing international maritime law for their actions. Iran Front Page quoted an unnamed military source as saying the tanker had been \u201ccrossing a route other than the shipping lane in the strait of Hormuz, had switched off its transponders and did not pay any attention to Iran\u2019s warnings when it was seized by the [Revolutionary Guards] forces\u201d. The seizure of the tankers came hours after authorities in Gibraltar announced that they were extending their custody of the Iranian tanker, seized by Royal Marines on 4 July, on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria, in violation of an EU embargo. Tehran has denounced the detention of the Grace 1 as piracy carried out on orders from Washington. Iranian politicians have been calling for reprisals and the country\u2019s forces, led by the Revolutionary Guards, are being increasingly aggressive in disrupting shipping lanes in the Gulf. The Stena Impero, a 30,000-tonne British-flagged and Swedish-owned ship, was heading for Saudi Arabia when it abruptly left international sea lanes, and tracking data showed it heading north towards the Iranian island of Qeshm, where the Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards have a substantial base. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards previously attempted to capture a British tanker six days after the Grace 1 was seized. On 10 July, a British warship, the HMS Montrose, intervened to drive off three Iranian military vessels that were attempting to divert a UK tanker, the British Heritage, towards Iranian territory. The incidents come amid a battle of nerves along the oil export routes of the Gulf, which has involved close encounters between Iranian, UK and US military forces. Earlier on Friday, Tehran denied Trump\u2019s claim that US forces had downed a Iranian drone over the Gulf. Iran\u2019s top military spokesman said all drones had returned safely to base, but Trump was adamant. \u201cNo doubt about it ... we shot it down,\u201d the US president said. Trump said on Thursday that the USS Boxer took defensive action after the unmanned vehicle came within 1,000 metres of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down. The prospect of negotiations that might defuse the standoff appeared more distant than ever on Friday as a senior US official dismissed a nuclear offer proposed the previous day by Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, during a visit to New York. The official suggested the offer was not serious and called for \u201can actual decision-maker\u201d to enter talks to \u201cend Iran\u2019s malign nuclear ambitions\u201d. Trump has vacillated on what he wants Iran to do in return for a lifting of the oil and banking embargo that the US has imposed since walking out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) in May last year. The sharp response to Zarif\u2019s offer suggests that administration hardliners, led by the national security adviser, John Bolton, are currently running Iran policy. Zarif proposed that Iran\u2019s parliament immediately ratify acceptance of a permanent regime of intrusive international inspections, known as the Additional Protocol, designed to ensure that Iran was not building nuclear weapons covertly.

It was not and he and his team will have to come with a better, and more honest, answer than that if he is ever going to figure out and fix what went wrong. Because the truth is that McIlroy played one of the very worst rounds of his life when it mattered most, on a course he, and his caddie, know as well as any in the world, a course where he then played, the very next day, some of his very finest golf, in a tournament he has been preparing for over the last two years. McIlroy\u2019s flaws make him easy to love but, if he is going to win more than the four majors he has, to win as many as his absurd natural talents deserve, he is going to have to figure out how to overcome them. \u201cThere\u2019s always next week,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a pretty big tournament in Memphis.\u201d As if history was going to remember how he gets on in the WGC-FedEx St Jude Invitational. \u201cEven though the major season is over for me, there\u2019s still a lot to play for.\u201d He did not sound convinced.",

      "bodyText": "The Los Angeles police department has revealed in court that it infiltrated an activist group planning anti-Trump protests, in the latest case of US law enforcement spying on leftwing organizers. A confidential informant working with the LAPD secretly recorded multiple meetings of a group called Refuse Fascism in 2017, according to newly disclosed police documents. The LAPD transcripts, first reported by the Los Angeles Times and reviewed by the Guardian, were submitted in a criminal case against activists who blocked a California freeway during an anti-Trump demonstration. Police equipped an informant with a hidden recording device and had the individual attend Refuse Fascism gatherings at a local church \u201cin an attempt to elicit information regarding the closure\u201d of the freeway and to express interest in being involved \u201cin any such future activities\u201d, police wrote. Miguel Antonio, one of the activists who was monitored and recorded by the informant, and then subsequently charged with misdemeanors for shutting down the freeway, told the Guardian on Friday that he would not let the surveillance stop him from organizing. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared. We\u2019re not going to back down in the face of repression,\u201d the 28-year-old said, adding that this kind of spying was meant to discourage activists. \u201cYou\u2019re in a church, and you\u2019re meeting about organizing a peaceful protest, and you\u2019re running the risk of being charged with conspiracy or these petty crimes.\u201d The LA case is one of several across the country of law enforcement aggressively targeting anti-Trump and anti-fascist groups with monitoring and criminal trials. In Sacramento, police worked with neo-Nazis to pursue cases against leftwing activists, including seeking charges against anti-fascist protesters who were stabbed at a white supremacist rally. In Berkeley, police collaborated with a violent pro-Trump demonstrator to prosecute a leftwing group last year, and there have been similar controversies in Washington DC, Oregon and other states. The LAPD surveillance was particularly striking given that there was documented evidence of violence involving far-right groups in southern California around the same time, and that those white supremacist organizations do pose a serious threat, said Mike German, a former FBI agent and expert on local extremist groups. \u201cThis case seems to fall into a pattern of police agencies viewing anti-fascist organizing as terrorism, while overlooking the far more deadly and frequent violence perpetrated by white supremacists and other far-right militants,\u201d he said. LAPD did not conduct a similar spying operation on far-right groups while it targeted Refuse Fascism, according to the Los Angeles Times. In a statement released late Friday, LAPD said the agency\u2019s chief, Michel Moore, had \u201cordered a top-to-bottom review to determine whether the department\u2019s stringent requirements for the use of confidential informants were followed\u201d. The department was \u201csteadfastly committed to constitutional policing\u201d, and would \u201ctake all necessary and appropriate steps to investigate any potential concerns raised\u201d, the statement added. The city attorney\u2019s office, which is prosecuting the activists, declined to comment. On 27 September 2017, Antonio and a group of activists shut down a freeway in downtown LA to protest Trump, one year after his election. After they were arrested, LAPD sent the informant, who has not been identified, to monitor the group\u2019s meetings at the Echo Park United Methodist Church. During an 11 October meeting, the informant approached Antonio and said, \u201cAre we gonna do like any freeway things again\u2026or major things like that?\u201d, according to a transcript of a secret recording. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Antonio responded. The informant then said he was interested in joining future activities: \u201cI thought the freeway thing was pretty good.\u201d Antonio then explained to the informant his thinking behind disrupting people\u2019s morning commutes and raising awareness about Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims, LGBTQ people, immigrants and others. The informant attended multiple meetings after that and coordinated with an LAPD detective. In one case, police noted in a write-up that one of the activists was caught on the recording making a joke about the president, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an awfully hot coffeepot, should I drop it on Donald Trump?\u201d Antonio was eventually charged with several misdemeanors, including obstructing public movement on a highway, failure to disperse from an unlawful assembly and failure to comply with a law enforcement order. A jury recently deadlocked in the case, and a new trial is scheduled to begin later this month. Damon Alimouri, Antonio\u2019s lawyer, said the LAPD surveillance was \u201cunjust and outrageous\u201d, adding that he suspected this type of spying was likely to escalate across the country. \u201cThe further left that younger people go, we will continue to see law enforcement infiltrating these groups secretly,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTo a certain extent, it might intimidate some, and I think that\u2019s the intention of the LAPD.\u201d Frank Wulf, the pastor of the church where the LAPD was conducting the surveillance, said it was \u201coffensive\u201d for police to \u201cinfiltrate a group whose purposes are clearly non-violent\u201d. \u201cThe government is interfering with the rights of protest in America,\u201d he said, adding that he worried about a chilling effect: \u201cYou never know if the person sitting next to you is a police informant or not.\u201d By permitting this type of surveillance, the LAPD also appeared to be violating its own standards meant to protect against unconstitutional monitoring, said Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. \u201cThe target for them was a group organizing in a church where there was no indication of any criminal activity that was afoot,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhat this story demonstrates is that the agency is frankly rogue.\u201d News of the infiltration was a reminder that the politically motivated surveillance that was common decades earlier in the US has not stopped, said Antonio, who also organizes with a group called the Revolution Club. He said that freeway demonstrations were meant to inspire people to get involved in organizing and remind them that the threats on people\u2019s rights are urgent \u2013 and that they can\u2019t wait until 2020. \u201cThere are concentration camps at the border, they are stripping women\u2019s rights to control their body, they are threatening war with Iran and they are destroying the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to act.\u201d",

We agree it would be different if the relationship between the questioner and the questioned was not as structured by racial relations of power to the extent that it was: more often than not the questioner is of white European ancestry and the questioned is of non-white European ancestry. And because of this, the question necessarily, and regardless of the intent, ends up carrying in it the power and entitlement of the questioner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/squad-mob-2020-election\">The Squad v the mob: that's what the 2020 election boils down to | Moustafa Baymoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The simple question \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d becomes, again, regardless of the intent of the questioner, a declaration: \u201cI am entitled, because of my white European-ness, to ask you where are you from.\u201d The pathology becomes most apparent when the person being asked the question is Indigenous. Because of the sense of entitlement that oozes out of it \u2013 and that is what is often hard, but not impossible, for others to understand \u2013 the question becomes threatening: a person of non-white European ancestry can immediately discern in the power to ask \u201cwhere do you come from?\u201d the residual power to say: \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d.</p> <p>It is in the very nature of this residual power to have a potential for \u201cnastiness\u201d (such as with \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d) at the very moment when it\u2019s exhibiting \u201cniceness\u201d (such as with \u201cwhere are you from\u201d). This fact was at the heart of the radical critique of multiculturalism as it was formulated more than 20 years ago. It was at the core of my own critique of the discourse of tolerance. To have such a discourse circulating amid structural conditions of racial domination meant two things.</p> <p>Firstly, it meant that it was always people of white European ancestry who ended up feeling entitled to do the tolerating, while the tolerated were always people of non-white European ancestry \u2013 what I called at the time \u201cthird-world-looking people\u201d.</p> <p>Secondly, and more important for our purpose here, when people experience themselves as entitled to be tolerant, they retain the residual power to be intolerant and deploy it when necessary. It went the same way for the multicultural discourse of \u201cappreciating\u201d ethnic cultures, which allowed white people to maintain the residual power to \u201cnot appreciate\u201d ethnic cultures.</p> <p>It is this residual power that was the prime target of the radical critique of multiculturalism. This aimed for a state of affairs where the status of the national belonging of people of non-white European ancestry would not be subjected to and affected by how people of white European ancestry felt about them. This was a state where it was no longer acceptable to give public space for people of white European ancestry who fantasised that it was up to them to judge who loved Australia, England or France enough and who didn\u2019t, and who was American, Canadian or New Zealander enough and who wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>The critique was animated by a realisation that while multiculturalism dented a sense of white supremacy among some people, it did not dent it enough. And while it was clear that one could not help it if some white people felt they were entitled to decide who was and was not a good Australian, American, etc, the radical critique of multiculturalism aimed to further the process of white symbolic disempowerment that had already begun with the rise of multiculturalism. It hoped to see white entitlement become increasingly expunged from social and cultural institutions and be made politically irrelevant.</p> <p>But, needless to say, things moved in the opposite direction. A constellation of cultural and political but chiefly economic interests aligned to support what became full-fledged politics of white restoration. Certain capitalist investors saw in the white supremacist refusal of the welfare state and any social, cultural or ecological thought a politics that was more conducive to the type of unchecked capital accumulation they hoped for.</p> <p>And here we are today with such people not only having a public outlet but actually occupying the highest positions of power in various parts of the western world. And here we also are hearing the kind of things that we thought we would never hear again being openly proclaimed. And, sure enough, here we are having the president of the United States openly deploying the gutter racism of the \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d-type against his opponents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/white-entitlement-is-part-of-the-very-structure-of-australian-society\">White entitlement is part of the very structure of Australian society | Ghassan Hage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What the politics of white restoration needs to make us ask is: how can the progressive social and cultural gains of the \u201cliberal\u201d era be rolled back so easily? If there is a failure of liberal multicultural politics here, it surely has to do with this. Small \u201cl\u201d liberals dismissed the radical critique of multiculturalism 20 years ago for all kinds of facile reasons.</p> <p>However, this radical critique offered whites and non-whites the basis of a political future that highlighted the disempowerment of whiteness as a necessary accompaniment of multicultural politics. This would have at the very least made the descent into the kind of toxic racist politics we are seeing today more difficult. This radical critique could offer such a path precisely because it traced a politics centred on the removal of the above-mentioned residual power of white entitlement. At least that was and is one of its key objectives. And by all means, let\u2019s all go back to where we came from in this regard, and restart that argument.</p> <p>Even if the politics of white restoration is succeeding, a new politics is needed to replace it to mend some white people\u2019s belief in their entitlement to rule. For this white resurgence has all the hallmarks of a last hurrah. On one hand, it is far from being the case that the majority of young generations of people of white European ancestry are seeking this type of entitlement. On the other hand, people from non-white European ancestry, especially the young, are fundamentally unwilling to accept the legitimacy of white entitlement.</p> <p>Indeed, it is certain today, and as \u201cthe Squad\u201d makes it clear, that the vast majority of people from non-white European ancestry inhabiting the west are too much at home here to ever accept a mode of belonging that involves white supervision. They don\u2019t believe they need to be supervised and they don\u2019t grant the self-appointed whites the right to supervise them. They will never accept a mode of belonging that involves being supervised by angelic, loving white people, let alone by evil, sleazy, racist ones.</p> <p>\u2022 Ghassan Hage is a professor of anthropology and social theory at the University of Melbourne</p>",

We\u2019ve often reflected together about this and about what bothers us about the question. We agree it would be different if the relationship between the questioner and the questioned was not as structured by racial relations of power to the extent that it was: more often than not the questioner is of white European ancestry and the questioned is of non-white European ancestry. And because of this, the question necessarily, and regardless of the intent, ends up carrying in it the power and entitlement of the questioner. The simple question \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d becomes, again, regardless of the intent of the questioner, a declaration: \u201cI am entitled, because of my white European-ness, to ask you where are you from.\u201d The pathology becomes most apparent when the person being asked the question is Indigenous. Because of the sense of entitlement that oozes out of it \u2013 and that is what is often hard, but not impossible, for others to understand \u2013 the question becomes threatening: a person of non-white European ancestry can immediately discern in the power to ask \u201cwhere do you come from?\u201d the residual power to say: \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d. It is in the very nature of this residual power to have a potential for \u201cnastiness\u201d (such as with \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d) at the very moment when it\u2019s exhibiting \u201cniceness\u201d (such as with \u201cwhere are you from\u201d). This fact was at the heart of the radical critique of multiculturalism as it was formulated more than 20 years ago. It was at the core of my own critique of the discourse of tolerance. To have such a discourse circulating amid structural conditions of racial domination meant two things. Firstly, it meant that it was always people of white European ancestry who ended up feeling entitled to do the tolerating, while the tolerated were always people of non-white European ancestry \u2013 what I called at the time \u201cthird-world-looking people\u201d. Secondly, and more important for our purpose here, when people experience themselves as entitled to be tolerant, they retain the residual power to be intolerant and deploy it when necessary. It went the same way for the multicultural discourse of \u201cappreciating\u201d ethnic cultures, which allowed white people to maintain the residual power to \u201cnot appreciate\u201d ethnic cultures. It is this residual power that was the prime target of the radical critique of multiculturalism. This aimed for a state of affairs where the status of the national belonging of people of non-white European ancestry would not be subjected to and affected by how people of white European ancestry felt about them. This was a state where it was no longer acceptable to give public space for people of white European ancestry who fantasised that it was up to them to judge who loved Australia, England or France enough and who didn\u2019t, and who was American, Canadian or New Zealander enough and who wasn\u2019t. The critique was animated by a realisation that while multiculturalism dented a sense of white supremacy among some people, it did not dent it enough. And while it was clear that one could not help it if some white people felt they were entitled to decide who was and was not a good Australian, American, etc, the radical critique of multiculturalism aimed to further the process of white symbolic disempowerment that had already begun with the rise of multiculturalism. It hoped to see white entitlement become increasingly expunged from social and cultural institutions and be made politically irrelevant. But, needless to say, things moved in the opposite direction. A constellation of cultural and political but chiefly economic interests aligned to support what became full-fledged politics of white restoration. Certain capitalist investors saw in the white supremacist refusal of the welfare state and any social, cultural or ecological thought a politics that was more conducive to the type of unchecked capital accumulation they hoped for. And here we are today with such people not only having a public outlet but actually occupying the highest positions of power in various parts of the western world. And here we also are hearing the kind of things that we thought we would never hear again being openly proclaimed. And, sure enough, here we are having the president of the United States openly deploying the gutter racism of the \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d-type against his opponents. What the politics of white restoration needs to make us ask is: how can the progressive social and cultural gains of the \u201cliberal\u201d era be rolled back so easily? If there is a failure of liberal multicultural politics here, it surely has to do with this. Small \u201cl\u201d liberals dismissed the radical critique of multiculturalism 20 years ago for all kinds of facile reasons. However, this radical critique offered whites and non-whites the basis of a political future that highlighted the disempowerment of whiteness as a necessary accompaniment of multicultural politics. This would have at the very least made the descent into the kind of toxic racist politics we are seeing today more difficult. This radical critique could offer such a path precisely because it traced a politics centred on the removal of the above-mentioned residual power of white entitlement. At least that was and is one of its key objectives. And by all means, let\u2019s all go back to where we came from in this regard, and restart that argument. Even if the politics of white restoration is succeeding, a new politics is needed to replace it to mend some white people\u2019s belief in their entitlement to rule. For this white resurgence has all the hallmarks of a last hurrah. On one hand, it is far from being the case that the majority of young generations of people of white European ancestry are seeking this type of entitlement. On the other hand, people from non-white European ancestry, especially the young, are fundamentally unwilling to accept the legitimacy of white entitlement. Indeed, it is certain today, and as \u201cthe Squad\u201d makes it clear, that the vast majority of people from non-white European ancestry inhabiting the west are too much at home here to ever accept a mode of belonging that involves white supervision. They don\u2019t believe they need to be supervised and they don\u2019t grant the self-appointed whites the right to supervise them. They will never accept a mode of belonging that involves being supervised by angelic, loving white people, let alone by evil, sleazy, racist ones. \u2022 Ghassan Hage is a professor of anthropology and social theory at the University of Melbourne",

We must try and get the balance right in the team. The market isn\u2019t really so simple at this moment. You always use your contacts in the world of football; there are lots of agents and technical directors.</p> <p>\u201cIf we feel we need a player for this squad we try to convince the other party it would be a good step for a loan player to come to our team for his development and to create value for next season. Many players, are they available or not because the Premier League clubs don\u2019t have their teams fixed yet. But there will be a lot more movement in the next two weeks I am sure. Derby also has really good relationships with a lot of good teams.\u201d</p> <p>Cocu\u2019s assistants, Twan Scheepers and Chris van der Weerden, as well as the specialist first-team coach, Liam Rosenior, sat in on a series of interviews with broadcasters and national media and the overriding sense from Cocu was that this is the perfect marriage after three months in charge of Fenerbahce, who sacked him in October.</p> <p>\u201cThe president had certain ideas but for many reasons what we had in mind was just not possible,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cThere was a Uefa sanction. To work in the way we wanted, it didn\u2019t work out but that is also football. But it doesn\u2019t change how I look into a club before I step. After a few conversations you get the feeling: \u2018This is the way I think about football and the way I want to develop and play with my team. It\u2019s a fit, it\u2019s a match; let\u2019s go for it.\u2019 You never get 100% guarantees it will work out but the feeling we have now is really good.\u201d</p> <p>Mel Morris, the Derby owner, suggested the club had added around \u00a330m-\u00a340m to the market values of Mount, Tomori and Wilson, owing to how the trio thrived last season. Of Cocu, Morris said it quickly became clear during their first meeting in London that the former midfielder was energised by the philosophy in place.</p> <p>\u201cI came away with Stephen Pearson, my CEO, and I said if he turns us down, we are going to struggle with the next set of interviews after this one because Phillip was very, very good,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe were amazed he was available.

      "bodyText": "Phillip Cocu has said he will not hesitate to call on his wealth of contacts as Derby County look to utilise the loan market that propelled them to last season\u2019s Championship play-off final. The Dutchman, who was unveiled as Frank Lampard\u2019s successor as manager on Friday, acknowledged that relationships with elite clubs could prove pivotal if Derby are to achieve his target of a top-six finish in his first season in England. Cocu, who has a four-year contract, declined to discuss individual targets but said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d for the club to re-sign Fikayo Tomori or Harry Wilson, though Derby are understood to have made their admiration for the latter clear to Liverpool should the Welshman be made available for loan. Mason Mount, who also spent last season at Derby, is set to be involved under Lampard at Chelsea. \u201cIf you look at the value of those players, they were very important last season,\u201d said Cocu, who has signed Everton\u2019s Kieran Dowell on a season\u2019s loan. \u201cWe must be sure which players we will go for. We must try and get the balance right in the team. The market isn\u2019t really so simple at this moment. You always use your contacts in the world of football; there are lots of agents and technical directors. \u201cIf we feel we need a player for this squad we try to convince the other party it would be a good step for a loan player to come to our team for his development and to create value for next season. Many players, are they available or not because the Premier League clubs don\u2019t have their teams fixed yet. But there will be a lot more movement in the next two weeks I am sure. Derby also has really good relationships with a lot of good teams.\u201d Cocu\u2019s assistants, Twan Scheepers and Chris van der Weerden, as well as the specialist first-team coach, Liam Rosenior, sat in on a series of interviews with broadcasters and national media and the overriding sense from Cocu was that this is the perfect marriage after three months in charge of Fenerbahce, who sacked him in October. \u201cThe president had certain ideas but for many reasons what we had in mind was just not possible,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cThere was a Uefa sanction. To work in the way we wanted, it didn\u2019t work out but that is also football. But it doesn\u2019t change how I look into a club before I step. After a few conversations you get the feeling: \u2018This is the way I think about football and the way I want to develop and play with my team. It\u2019s a fit, it\u2019s a match; let\u2019s go for it.\u2019 You never get 100% guarantees it will work out but the feeling we have now is really good.\u201d Mel Morris, the Derby owner, suggested the club had added around \u00a330m-\u00a340m to the market values of Mount, Tomori and Wilson, owing to how the trio thrived last season. Of Cocu, Morris said it quickly became clear during their first meeting in London that the former midfielder was energised by the philosophy in place. \u201cI came away with Stephen Pearson, my CEO, and I said if he turns us down, we are going to struggle with the next set of interviews after this one because Phillip was very, very good,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe were amazed he was available. We\u2019d done our homework on him, and he on us. I said to him right at the beginning, if this is about a Premier League money or salary then we can\u2019t do that, but if he is literally looking to bounce back from what happened at Fenerbahce, then maybe he will find this is a great home for him. When we met, we could sense that excitement from him about what we are trying to do.\u201d Morris, asked whether he felt Derby needed a high-profile appointment to counteract the departure of Lampard, replied: \u201cI heard the players talk about the respect for what Frank was asking them to do and Frank\u2019s ability to be able to demonstrate those things, and to illustrate parts. People do not question that level of talent. \u201cYou can have a manager that comes on board and it takes longer to get that belief from a manager that has not played. If you have someone who has done it before, I think players do respect that massively. Teams fall apart because belief gets shattered, belief disappears, belief that \u2018we can do it\u2019, belief in the manager\u2019s tactics. They are the things that cause you those dips and it is how you bounce back and get the belief reinstated that is the key.\u201d",

Moments after missing the decisive penalty in the shootout at the end of the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations final, Senegal\u2019s Aliou Ciss\u00e9 made a vow. One day, he said, he would go that last step and make his country African champions for the first time. Now, 17 years later, here he is, the manager of the Teranga Lions as they bid to make history. </p> <p>But in their way stand Algeria, whose yearning his equally strong, not least because most of the crowd in the stadium in Cairo is made up of their compatriots. Djamel Belmadi\u2019s men have looked slightly sharper throughout this tournament and, indeed, beat Senegal 1-0 during the group stages, albeit after Sadio Man\u00e9 was denied a blatant penalty. But Senegal have been solid grinders, aided by sporadic flourishes from players such as Man\u00e9, Idrissa Gueye and Kr\u00e9pin Diatta, plus raids from left-back by Yousouf Sabaly. Their main strength, however, has been their solidity and that is likely to be weakened today by the suspension of the majestic Kalidou Koulibaly. </p> <p>Algeria are also deprived of an important player \u2013 right-back Youcef Atal \u2013 but he is easier to replace than Koulibaly, who has been the bulwark of Senegal\u2019s defence and a frequent instigator of their attacks. Baghdad Bounedjah, the Algerian striker who plays with a savvy brand of rambunctiousness (and erratic finishing), could spread mayhem in a rejigged backline; and Riyad Mahrez\u2019s late rocket in the semi-final suggests he\u2019s hitting form at just the right time. So Ciss\u00e9 and Senegal have a big job on their hands \u2013 but history is within their grasp. It\u2019s showtime!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-19T19:21:32.044Z\">at 8.21pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Senegal 0-1 Algeria Bounedjah\u2019s deflected strike in the second minute has given the Fennecs their second continental title, their first since 1990. Their players and fans celebrate a career-defining achievement, and they don\u2019t care that the match was an ugly spectacle. They deserve their crown, they have been the best team throughout the tournament. Senegal leave with the familiar anguish of a chance missed. They were both unlucky and untidy. Their wait for a title goes on. 90+4 min: San\u00e9 lashes the freekick into the wall. 90+3 min: Danger here! Deliberate handball earns Guedioura a booking and gives Senegal a freekick about 25 yards out, a little to the left. This is their chance to snatch a late equaliser .... 90+2 min: A decent delivery at last! Gueye floats a useful ball into the box from wide on the left. Mbolhi earns the adulation of his teammates by claiming it amid a thicket of bodies. 90 min: There will be at least four more minutes. No idea why there isn\u2019t more, given all the stoppages there have been. 89 min: A reckless tackle by Guedioura gives Senegal a freekick wide on the right. But the delivery is again woeful. Algeria substitution: Slimani on, Bounedjah off 87 min: Diatta stands over a freekick wide on the left. Senegal sends all their big lads into the box. And Diatta balloons it over the bar. What an an awful freekick. 86 min: It\u2019s still too bitty, disfigured by cunning or rash fouls. Senegal have lost the rhythm they briefly had earlier in the half, and Algerian fans are starting to sense glory is within reach ... Senegal substitution: Bald\u00e9 on, Niang off. Algeria substitutions: Brahimi and Tahrat on, Balaili and Feghouli 83 min: A good ball into the Algeria box is headed out to the edge of the area, where it drops invitingly for Sarr. He volleys it hard ... and too high! And then he holds his hands in his hands, knowing excitement for the better of him there. 82 min: Algeria launch a long ball forward to Bounedjah, who does his utmost to barge his way past the last two defenders but runs straight into Kouyat\u00e9. 80 min: Gassama booked for a mistimed tackle on Bennacer. 79 min: Gueye, who has not been as influential today as in previous games, is booked for a foul. And during that pause the ref allows Benlamri to rejoin the action in a pair of pristine new shorts. 78 min: Benlamri has been patched up and wants to come back on, but the officials won\u2019t allow it until he changes out of his blood-splattered shorts. Algeria must play on with 10 men... 77 min: Diattta deposits a corner right on top of Mbolhi, who ignores the challenge of Diagne and punches well clear. Senegal substitution: Diagne on, Saivet off. That suggests a switch to two up front, and a new person to take Senegal\u2019s setpieces - Saivet\u2019s deliveries have been poor so he won\u2019t be missed. 76 min: Benlamri and Man\u00e9 clash heads as they contest a bouncing ball, leaving the Algerian with blood spewing from an open wound on his face. 74 min: Mahrez\u2019s curls a vicious corner into the near post. Gomis does well to punch it clear under pressure. 73 min: Mahrez relieves the pressure by drawing a foul in the Senegalese half. Then he curls the freekick from the left into the box. Sane has to nod it behind for a corner to stop Bensebaini from getting on the end of it. 70 min: Algeria look jaded. They can\u2019t string three passes together and are struggling to keep pace with Senegal\u2019s runs. Can they hold on for another 20 minutes? Tick, tock! Tick, tock! 69 min: Nifty play by Senegal to find work Sabalay into space about 20 yards from goal. He unleashes a swirling shot that M\u2019Bohli pushes over the bar with difficulty. 68 min: Diatte has made a difference for Senegal, who are stretching Algeria more and more. The North Africans are clinging on ... 66 min: Niang peels wide with a clever run and is rewarded with a fine low pass from deep by Kouyat\u00e9. M\u2019bohli rushes off the line to try to intercept at the edge of the area, but Niang beats him to it. In doing so he takes the ball quite quite, and he can\u2019t steer his shot on to the target. 64 min: Senegal resume their pursuit of an equaliser. Algeria continue to show no ambition other than to hold them at bay. The ref his overturned his decision, presumably on the grounds that the handball was not deliberate. This seems a good time to recall that Senegal are missing one of the best players today, Koulibably, because he was booked for a similar handball in the semi-final.. Sarr\u2019s cross from the right struck the arm of Guedioura. There was no way he could get out of the way but the ref has no hesitate in pointing to the spot. It\u2019ll be a while before the spotkick is taken, however, because Algeria are protesting hard. Oh, and now the ref is going over to check the Var screen... Senegal substitution: Diatta on, Ndiaye off. A welcome attempt to introduce more creativity to Senegal\u2019s midfield. 58 min: That\u2019s better! From the left wing Sabalay rolls a low pass to Man\u00e9 in the box. He spins past a defender and lashes the ball across the face of goal. Benlamri does well to divert it away from the danger zone with his thigh. 56 min: Another freekick for Senegal, midway inside the Algerian half. Saviet\u2019s delivery is again lacking. True quality has yet to make an appearance in this final. 54 min: Belaili booked for rebuking the referee after being penalised for an awkward challenge on Gassama. 52 min: Man\u00e9 leads a break for Senegal, dashing towards the Algerian box, where, for once, Algeria don\u2019t have many players. Man\u00e9 knocks the ball through to Niang and darts through in the hope of getting a return pass. But Niang\u2019s control is lamentable, and the ball won\u2019t be coming back. 50 min: Good work by Sarr and Gassam down the right, until Bensebaini intelligently shepherds Gassama towards the corner flag. 48 min: Ndiaye takes out Bounedjah, giving Algeria a freekick in dangerous crossing territory, to the left of Senegal\u2019s box. Bennacer flights it in, Gassama nuts it away. 47 min: It took only 43 seconds for the first freekick of the second half to be awarded. The next came 20 seconds later... 46 min: Algeria get the second half going. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re going to try to increase their lead rather than just palm off Senegal. As the players made their way off the pitch, several of the substitutes squared up to each other and there was some feisty pushing and shoving. At this point it\u2019s hard to say which we are more likely to see in the second half: another goal or a big ol\u2019 donnybrook. After a storming start and a fortuitous goal, Algeria have been pushed backwards by Senegal. Mostly the play was scrappy and ill-tempered, at times downright pathetic given some of the theatrics, but in the last few minutes of the half Senegal started to look sharper, passing and moving with precision and speed. Not enough to truly unhinge the Algerian defence yet, but Belmadi must know that if this pattern continues, an equaliser is on the cards. Algeria need to regain control and put on more pressure at the other end, where Senegal\u2019s defence look dodgy. 45 min: Top pressing by Senegal to win the ball on half-way. Then they moved forward fast with a series of one-touch passes, before Sarr goes down in the box under a tackle. The ref points to the corner flag in the belief that the defender poked the ball to safety, but Senegal\u2019s players want him to consult Var because the the defender came through Sarr to get the ball. But the ref isn\u2019t changing his mind. 43 min: Saivet\u2019s freekick is cleared at the near post by Benlamri. 42 min: The pressure from Senegal mounts. Ndiaye nicks the ball off Mahrez deep in Algeria territory and is then shoved over, giving Senegal a freekick near the byline, to the left of the box... 40 min: Dangerous probing by Senegal around the Algerian box. Man\u00e9 and Gueye try to open them up with a quick one-two, but Algeria hold firm. That\u2019s encouraging, though, for Senegal, because when Man\u00e9 and Gueye have started to combine in this tournament, they wrought havoc. 37 min: Niang traps the ball nicely with his back to goal, 20 yards. Then he shuffles slickly, spins and fires a terrific shot just over the bar. What a way that would have been for him to notch his first goal of the tournament! 36 min: Niang flops the grass in the box. There\u2019s far too much of this carry-on now, from both teams. Fortunately the ref\u2019s not any it so far. 35 min: Setpieces look to be Senegal\u2019s most likely route to goal at the moment. They have a corner here but before it can be taken there\u2019s a stoppage, as Man\u00e9 throws his arm into Feghouli\u2019s mid-riff as players jostle for position in the goualmouth. Feghouli accepts the invitation to fall to the ground. The ref sensibly decides a firm word for both is sufficient. Then Saivet wastes the corner. 33 min: Kouyat\u00e9 is good to continue. Within moment of his return to the action, there\u2019s another stoppage as Bensebani gets a yellow card for a late tackle on Gueye. It\u2019s getting very scrappy out there. 31 min: Kouyat\u00e9 hares out to the right wing and clears the ball just before Bennacer can collect it. His momentum takes him crashing into the Algerian player and now he\u2019s down in need of treatment. No blame on Bennacer for that, but perhaps more costly bad luck for Senegal ... 29 min: Bennacer rages at the referee to awarding a free against him in midfield. He throws his hands in the air and spins like a Tasmanian devil. The ref figures he needs a stern lecture to set him straight. 27 min: Saivet goes from goal from the freekick, fizzing in a swerving shot that bounces just in front of the keeper, who holds is well. 25 min: Lovely turn in midfield by Man\u00e9, followed by an nimble scamper past two players before he wins a freekick about 25 yards from goal ... 22 min: Algeria try to set up camp in the Senegalese half but that ambition is undermined by scrappy passing. The increased tempo and pressure from Senegal has made Algeria a tad scruffy, but has not yet opened up any real chances for an equaliser. 20 min: Saivet curls over a freekick from the right. It\u2019s a wicked delivery and the two nearest Senegalese players go down in a heap under challenges from the defenders; but the referee correctly rules that no foul took place. 18 min: Ndiaye drives 40 yards forward, turning defence into attack, and then slips the ball wide to Sabalay on the left. Mahrez gets back to clear the incoming cross. 16 min: Man\u00e9 brings the non-Algerian part of the crowd to its feet by tricking his way past two opponents in his own half before calmly laying the ball back to San\u00e9, who punts it downfield. 14 min: A positive spell from Senegal, insofar as they have spent a bit of time in Algerian territory, albeit without being able to release any of their forward. But Man\u00e9 has made a couple of clever runs, suggesting that if they can pick him out, he\u2019ll do damage. 12 min: This is a mental test for Senegal, too. Their history in this tournament is full of near misses, misfortune and critical errors at crucial times, so conceding a freakish goal early on inevitably risks triggering fatalistic fears. Let\u2019s see how they fend them off. 10 min: Niang, who has had a stinker of tournament all told, fails to control a low pass from deep. If he can\u2019t hold up balls, Senegal are going to struggle to unsettle this Algerian defence. 8 min: During a pause in play the TV shows a replay of the goal, pointing out that Badou Ndiaye was furious at Gomis for not trying to jump for the goal as it drifted over his head. It did seem to arc very slowly past him but it looked like it was heading over the bar until it dropped quite suddenly into the net. 6 min: Belaili clips a freekick from midway into the Senegalese box. And now the absence of Koulibali is clear, as it takes Senegal several attempts to scramble the ball away under pressure. 4 min: It\u2019s been a tremendous start, not just because of the goal but thanks to the tempo and attacking intent of both sides. Algeria are showing no sign of simply trying to protect their lead: they want more. What a start! Kouyat\u00e9 is too eager to cut out a ball and Bounedjah rolls him out of the way to collect it wide on the left, then dashes towards the area and unleashes a 20-yard shot that takes a treacherous deflection off Sane and loops over the keeper and into the net! That sounds like immediate evidence of the fallibility of Senegal without Koulibaly but there was nothing San\u00e9 could do about that: wretched luck for Senegal, the perfect beginning for Algeria. 2 min: Gassama flings a throw-in from the right to Sarr, who takes it nicely and flashes a fierce ball across the face of goal. 1 min: The 2019 Africa Cup of Nations is go! Senegal kick off and zoom forward pronto. That\u2019s the spirit! \u201cAlgeria v Senegal is - again - City v Liverpool, Mahrez vs Man\u00e9,\u201d notes Angello Noel. Well yes, it is, but it is also much, much more. And it\u2019s imminent! It\u2019s a beautiful scene in Cairo. The stadium is (close to) full of happy people sporting their teams\u2019 colours. And judging by the hearty accompaniment to the national anthem, Algerian fans outnumber the Senegalese by a a huge amount. Belmadi looks moved almost to tears. With ten minutes to kickoff, the temperature in Cairo is a tolerable 30 degrees, with humidity at 43 per cent. Senegal will be dressed all in green, Algeria in white - the opposite, in other words, to when they met in the group stations. Will the result be any different? As expected Salis San\u00e9 is chosen as the replacement for Koulibaly in the heart of Senegal\u2019s defence, albeit not on his preferred side of the central defensive duo. Up front Ismail Sarr returns after a stop-start tournament so far. Algeria, meanwhile, have plumped for Mehdi Zeffane at right-back, where he tends to be defensively sound but not as enterprising going forward as the suspended Atal. Senegal: Gomis; Gassama, Kouyat\u00e9, San\u00e9, Sabaly; B N\u2019Diaye, Gueye, Saivet; Sarr, Niang, Man\u00e9 Subs: Diallo, Ciss, Ciss\u00e9, Konat\u00e9, Keita, A N\u2019Diaye, Diatta, Diagne, Thioub, Wagu\u00e9 Algeria: M\u2019Bolhi; Zeffane, Mandi, Benlamri, Bensebaini; Guedioura, Bennacer; Feghouli, Mahrez, Belaili; Bounedjah Subs: Doukha, Tahrat, Halliche, Fares, Brahimi, Slimani, Ounas, Boudaoui, Oukidja, Abeid Referee: A Alioum (Cameroon) Hello and welcome. Moments after missing the decisive penalty in the shootout at the end of the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations final, Senegal\u2019s Aliou Ciss\u00e9 made a vow. One day, he said, he would go that last step and make his country African champions for the first time. Now, 17 years later, here he is, the manager of the Teranga Lions as they bid to make history. But in their way stand Algeria, whose yearning his equally strong, not least because most of the crowd in the stadium in Cairo is made up of their compatriots. Djamel Belmadi\u2019s men have looked slightly sharper throughout this tournament and, indeed, beat Senegal 1-0 during the group stages, albeit after Sadio Man\u00e9 was denied a blatant penalty. But Senegal have been solid grinders, aided by sporadic flourishes from players such as Man\u00e9, Idrissa Gueye and Kr\u00e9pin Diatta, plus raids from left-back by Yousouf Sabaly. Their main strength, however, has been their solidity and that is likely to be weakened today by the suspension of the majestic Kalidou Koulibaly. Algeria are also deprived of an important player \u2013 right-back Youcef Atal \u2013 but he is easier to replace than Koulibaly, who has been the bulwark of Senegal\u2019s defence and a frequent instigator of their attacks. Baghdad Bounedjah, the Algerian striker who plays with a savvy brand of rambunctiousness (and erratic finishing), could spread mayhem in a rejigged backline; and Riyad Mahrez\u2019s late rocket in the semi-final suggests he\u2019s hitting form at just the right time. So Ciss\u00e9 and Senegal have a big job on their hands \u2013 but history is within their grasp. It\u2019s showtime!",

This wasn\u2019t just people not paying attention to politics because they\u2019ve got better things to do in their busy lives. It was an active choice not to engage, because they felt disgust and disdain for it.

      "bodyText": "Late last year the Democracy 2025 project of the Museum of Australian Democracy and the University of Canberra released a major piece of research finding that trust in democracy in Australia has plummeted from 86% in 2007 to 41% in 2018. Through quantitative and qualitative research over many years, they found compelling evidence of an increasing trust divide between government and citizens. This was reflected in falling trust in politicians, political parties and other key institutions (especially media), and a lack of confidence in the capacity of the government to address the public\u2019s concerns. Importantly though, the researchers found strong ongoing support for the principles of democracy. Together, these seemingly contradictory statements show Australians like democracy, just not the version we have \u2013 our systems and our institutions of government are not doing the job we need them to do. This is vital, because it points us to what we need to do in response. After a centuries-long struggle to demand democratic franchise for more and more people, we\u2019ve become complacent as those in power have made that franchise less and less meaningful. We now need to re-engage people in democratic decision-making about our common future; we have to re-enfranchise ourselves by truly cultivating democracy. Disenfranchisement is clearly one of the central phenomena of global politics today. It sits behind Trumpism and the Brexit slogan \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, as well as leftwing movements such as Occupy and Podemos, Naomi Klein\u2019s articulation of a growing \u201ccorporatocracy\u201d, and the rise of new commons-based politics in communities around the world. I have seen it rising (and being deliberately stoked) over 20 years of involvement in and observation of politics. And I\u2019ve written about it and made it a focus of my work here at the Green Institute. But it\u2019s one thing to be aware of it and another altogether to be confronted by it, day in day out, in countless conversations, as a candidate running for election in what is probably among the most politically engaged electorates in the country. The strong message coming from people I speak to is that politics is irrelevant to them, that it\u2019s a waste of time, that it can\u2019t and won\u2019t make any difference. This wasn\u2019t just people not paying attention to politics because they\u2019ve got better things to do in their busy lives. It was an active choice not to engage, because they felt disgust and disdain for it. From Watergate to the deregulation of the banks, from poor planning decisions to the failure to act on the climate emergency, they saw no reason to have faith that voting would have any real impact on things that matter to them. This sentiment goes some way to explaining what happened at this election. With Labor presenting a confusing and conflicted vision under an uninspiring leader and the Coalition being a farce, the combined major party vote fell to below 75% for the first time since our modern party configuration developed post-war; this is down from 77% in 2016, 79% in 2013, 81% in 2010 and 85% in 2007. In this context, a scare campaign backed by two billionaires (Clive Palmer and Rupert Murdoch) swung enough preferences to the right to enable an unpopular Coalition government to scrape back in above an even more unpopular Labor opposition. It\u2019s important to emphasise that this is a phenomenon of disengagement from politics, not from the world. Reflecting the Democracy 2025 analysis, a huge number of people I spoke to were deeply concerned about issues \u2013 climate, housing, refugees, inequality \u2013 but felt that democratic politics as it currently exists is so flawed as to make engagement with it pointless and depressing. Protest movements are big and growing. Community activism at various levels is tremendous. People care. They just don\u2019t believe our politics will change anything.

The collapse in faith in our democracies isn\u2019t an accident.

By pushing people out of democratic engagement, and undermining the role of government itself, it has relegated any conception of power to the level of individual action and consumer behaviour.

There are some remarkable examples of this going on around the world already that we can use as the seeds to grow new, reimagined democracies around. Here in Australia, the most exciting example is the participatory Voices for Indi campaign that elected independent MP Cathy McGowan twice and made history by electing Helen Haines to succeed her.

      "body": "<p>The headlines pegged to Stephanie Wood\u2019s book, Fake, focus on the sensational. Here is a story about a scammer, a man who seduced and manipulated women. Here is a story told from inside a relationship with that man, from someone who fell victim to his charms. Here is an insight into the fabrication, the web of lies, the danger of trusting someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 you meet through the glassy veneer of dating apps. Here is, as they say, a solid yarn.</p> <p>That focus is not without justification, of course. This sort of story taps into our deepest voyeuristic urges; our fascination with dark, deliberate acts of cruelty, the audacity of calculated deception, and the lines between truth and falsity that become ever more blurred the closer we look at them.</p> <p>Wood is no stranger to that voyeuristic urge \u2013 neither the magnetism of it, nor the delicate matter of telling a story that appeals so deeply to it. A journalist, and a widely respected and long-time features writer for the media organisation formerly known as Fairfax, her stock in trade has been extraordinary stories. It\u2019s just that this time the story was her own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/11/tara-june-winch-the-yield-andrew-bolt-unmissables\">\u2018I had to be manic\u2019: Tara June Winch on her unmissable new novel \u2013 and surviving Andrew Bolt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fake details Wood\u2019s experience of falling in love, and falling for the lies of, a serial fabulist. The relationship, which began with an online dating match, lasted 15 months, and ended when the snowballs of truth that Wood found herself occasionally pelted with \u2013 and knocked sideways by \u2013 turned into an avalanche. \u201cJoe\u201d had once been an architect, he said. He now farmed sheep on a property in New South Wales\u2019s southern tablelands. He showed her pictures of it; he wore moleskins. The house he lived in on Sydney harbour he had designed and built himself; he kept it in the divorce, and shared custody with his ex-wife of his two school-aged children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2e3694beafbc5f723f433e7babb831dc5767c2ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e3694beafbc5f723f433e7babb831dc5767c2ce/0_0_6206_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early morning views Cowra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"403\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For Wood \u2013 single, childless, over 40 \u2013 the romantic landscape looked grim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: lovleah/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet while Wood readily provides the raw material to satisfy the voyeur\u2019s hunger, steadily winding and unwinding the threads for the reader, she does more than that. She canvasses others who have experienced systematic romantic manipulation, such as former the NBC producer Benita Alexander who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/celebrity-surgeon-nbc-news-producer-scam\">was scammed by celebrity surgeon Paolo Macchiarini</a>. She speaks to experts in psychology, and she turns the skills of her trade, her journalism, those tools of self-sufficiency and truth-telling, onto Joe himself. Most importantly, she draws a portrait not only of a liar, but of a woman living in an era that, in spite of all its apparent freedoms, pushes down hard on those who haven\u2019t partnered off, had children or lived conventional lives.</p> <p>For Wood \u2013 single, childless, over 40 \u2013 the romantic landscape looked grim. That didn\u2019t mean she fell for Joe instantly. Joe wasn\u2019t \u201criveting company\u201d, even on their first date: \u201cSomething about his conversation, his manner of talking, is strange, shallow even; there is a sense perhaps that he has rehearsed for this moment, or that he is relaying his information by rote,\u201d she writes.</p> <p>He put her offside repeatedly during their first few interactions, first in person and then over text. He regularly ghosted on her, sometimes in the middle of dates. Yet he reeled her in as often as he pushed her away, deftly wielding the push-and-pull, \u201ctreat \u2018em mean\u201d-style of cruel romantic manipulation that yields social approval not least because it is glamorised by our romance-saturated storytelling culture.</p> <p>While telling the story of Joe, Wood simultaneously dissects how her own past made her susceptible to his lies. Her lifelong absorption of those romantic narratives is only part of it; there are also the deeply personal and distinctly gendered feelings of loneliness and childlessness she has written about only twice before:<strong> </strong>\u201cI am not known. I have longed to be known.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e66cb88f43220cc271ae50d1ac352423c751d76d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e66cb88f43220cc271ae50d1ac352423c751d76d/0_0_5360_3667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie Wood, author of the novel Fake, photographed in Redfern, Sydney, Australia. 12 July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Wood, author of Fake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Years later, she struggles to picture Joe\u2019s face clearly.

      "bodyText": "The headlines pegged to Stephanie Wood\u2019s book, Fake, focus on the sensational. Here is a story about a scammer, a man who seduced and manipulated women. Here is a story told from inside a relationship with that man, from someone who fell victim to his charms. Here is an insight into the fabrication, the web of lies, the danger of trusting someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 you meet through the glassy veneer of dating apps. Here is, as they say, a solid yarn. That focus is not without justification, of course. This sort of story taps into our deepest voyeuristic urges; our fascination with dark, deliberate acts of cruelty, the audacity of calculated deception, and the lines between truth and falsity that become ever more blurred the closer we look at them. Wood is no stranger to that voyeuristic urge \u2013 neither the magnetism of it, nor the delicate matter of telling a story that appeals so deeply to it. A journalist, and a widely respected and long-time features writer for the media organisation formerly known as Fairfax, her stock in trade has been extraordinary stories. It\u2019s just that this time the story was her own. Fake details Wood\u2019s experience of falling in love, and falling for the lies of, a serial fabulist. The relationship, which began with an online dating match, lasted 15 months, and ended when the snowballs of truth that Wood found herself occasionally pelted with \u2013 and knocked sideways by \u2013 turned into an avalanche. \u201cJoe\u201d had once been an architect, he said. He now farmed sheep on a property in New South Wales\u2019s southern tablelands. He showed her pictures of it; he wore moleskins. The house he lived in on Sydney harbour he had designed and built himself; he kept it in the divorce, and shared custody with his ex-wife of his two school-aged children. Yet while Wood readily provides the raw material to satisfy the voyeur\u2019s hunger, steadily winding and unwinding the threads for the reader, she does more than that. She canvasses others who have experienced systematic romantic manipulation, such as former the NBC producer Benita Alexander who was scammed by celebrity surgeon Paolo Macchiarini. She speaks to experts in psychology, and she turns the skills of her trade, her journalism, those tools of self-sufficiency and truth-telling, onto Joe himself. Most importantly, she draws a portrait not only of a liar, but of a woman living in an era that, in spite of all its apparent freedoms, pushes down hard on those who haven\u2019t partnered off, had children or lived conventional lives. For Wood \u2013 single, childless, over 40 \u2013 the romantic landscape looked grim. That didn\u2019t mean she fell for Joe instantly. Joe wasn\u2019t \u201criveting company\u201d, even on their first date: \u201cSomething about his conversation, his manner of talking, is strange, shallow even; there is a sense perhaps that he has rehearsed for this moment, or that he is relaying his information by rote,\u201d she writes. He put her offside repeatedly during their first few interactions, first in person and then over text. He regularly ghosted on her, sometimes in the middle of dates. Yet he reeled her in as often as he pushed her away, deftly wielding the push-and-pull, \u201ctreat \u2018em mean\u201d-style of cruel romantic manipulation that yields social approval not least because it is glamorised by our romance-saturated storytelling culture. While telling the story of Joe, Wood simultaneously dissects how her own past made her susceptible to his lies. Her lifelong absorption of those romantic narratives is only part of it; there are also the deeply personal and distinctly gendered feelings of loneliness and childlessness she has written about only twice before: \u201cI am not known. I have longed to be known.\u201d Years later, she struggles to picture Joe\u2019s face clearly. That facelessness \u2013 the slipperiness of his visage in her memory \u2013 Wood puts down to his shapeshifting, his abrupt turnabouts of mood and manner, the distinct personalities that he would flick through, the contrasting characters he would inhabit. In a moment on the couch: trustworthy and completely simpatico. Elsewhere: thunderous rage. But it also gives him a malleable quality, allowing her to squeeze him into the space she needs him to fill.This tactic is only partially successful; her frequent bouts of intense anxiety throughout the relationship attest perhaps to her knowing, on some level, that things weren\u2019t right long before she could fully confront it. In the hands of a lesser craftsperson, such a story \u2013 written in hindsight \u2013 might find itself bogged down in telling readers what they already know, especially since the book had been foregrounded by another article in Good Weekend. But Wood understands that it\u2019s not enough to tell the reader that someone has lied, even lied deliberately, repeatedly; even that they have creatively fashioned mazes of deception through which they have sent numerous hapless, trusting victims. The true fascination \u2013 the voyeuristic pleasure \u2013 comes from the unspooling of the lie, the fallout, the dissection of the motivations of the liar and the social fabric surrounding them. Why did they do it? How did they get away with it? And, finally: Have they been brought to justice? The reader yearns for the unravelling of the deception, to wallow in it. Wood was the victim of it; she more than anyone has the right to exult in the fury, the horror, the revulsion that must come from having one\u2019s trust and intimacy so deeply betrayed.

      "bodyText": "Former Labor MP Michael Danby charged taxpayers thousands of dollars to pay one of his staffers consultancy fees to provide an after-hours \u201ccommunications service\u201d that included writing an anti-Greens opinion piece. Invoice documents from Danby\u2019s office, released through freedom of information law, show he contracted a firm named Developer Approvals Australia for a range of communications consultancy work between October 2018 and February 2019. The work included advice on targeted social media campaigns for the electorate, coordinating work to be done by a video production company for Danby, briefing a graphic designer on ads to be taken out in the local press, and other duties typically handled by electorate staff. Included in the invoices published by the department are \u201cdevelopment of communications \u2013 graphics and copy for mass mailout of the electorate (anti-Green)\u201d and the \u201cwriting of anti-Green op-ed for Australian Financial Review\u201d. The individual costs of the items were redacted. According to an Asic search, James Bingham is the sole director of Developer Approvals Australia. Bingham was a staffer for Danby and in his valedictory speech, Danby paid tribute to Bingham for returning to Australia from Spain to help Danby out with the last eight months of his political career. Danby confirmed to Guardian Australia that the invoice related to payments to one of his staffers. But he said the communications work had been done outside of normal work hours. Danby also said he had received approval from the relevant department for the use of the consultant. \u201cUnlike the Green Party who have a record of exploiting unpaid interns, I believe people should be paid for the work they do,\u201d Danby told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe staffer concerned provided a communications service outside normal work hours,\u201d he said. \u201cMany MPs use consultants and must get approval from the dept (as I did) for their projects.\u201d The total cost of the work over the period was $22,355.33.

A Liberal party staffer and former federal Liberal candidate, he says he is \u201cabout as far removed from being a bleeding heart small-l liberal as you could expect to find\u201d.</p> <p>But he is one of a growing number of Australians who have decided to cut down, or cut out, the meat or other animal products in their diet.</p> <p>According to<a href=\"http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/7944-vegetarianism-in-2018-april-2018-201904120608\"> research by Roy Morgan</a> nearly 2.5m Australians, just over 12% of the population, said they ate vegetarian or primarily vegetarian diets in 2018, up from 2.2m in 2014. Despite that apparent trend, Australians are still the biggest meat consumers in the world: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/meat-and-seafood-production-consumption#\">in 2014 the average Australian ate 116kg of meat per year</a>, almost three times the global average of 43kg.</p> <p>Recent converts told Guardian Australia they were motivated by animal welfare concerns, anxiety over the climate crisis, concerns about factory farming and, in some cases, convenience. A number cited Dominion, a documentary by an Australian filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/08/animal-rights-activists-block-melbourne-cbd-amid-protests-at-abattoirs-around-australia\">connected to recent protests</a> and trespass on agricultural properties that has been criticised as \u201cmisleading\u201d by the National Farmers Federation.</p> <h2>No truck with fake meat products</h2> <p>Attenborough was frequently cited as the catalyst. The 92-year-old is an amplifier for climate scientists who say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown\">beef consumption in western countries like Australia needs to fall by up to 90% to avoid a climate breakdown</a>.</p> <p>Georgina Laidlaw watched a three-part Attenborough documentary on the Galapagos Islands before booking a holiday there in May 2015. She lives on a small acreage near Ballarat and began killing her own ducks and chickens for meat in 2007.

The hardest part, she says, was overcoming her fear of being impolite by informing family and friends that they might have to cater separately to her.</p> <p>Thankfully the rise of foodie culture, and specifically the celebrity chef Yotam Ottolenghi, a longtime food columnist for the Guardian, has eased the way. Gone are the sludgy lentil soups that characterised western vegetarianism in the 1970s. Even meat eaters will happily cook an Ottolenghi concoction, or queue for trendy vegan restaurants such as Smith &amp; Daughters in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy.</p> <p>But while she has found being a vegetarian easy to manage, veganism is off the cards.</p> <p>\u201cIf I got rid of eggs and dairy I would be eating tofu at every turn, and that sounds like the title of a horror novel,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She has no truck with fake meat products. Buchanan, on the other hand, appears to have tried all of them. He can recommend the best burger (\u201cLinda McCartney, hands down\u201d) the best fake fish (\u201cQuorn have just brought out some absolutely lovely fish fillet options\u201d) and the best vegan bacon.</p> <p>The bacon was a sticking point. \u201cSomeone swore to me that coconut chips were the way to go,\u201d he says. \u201cLittle slices of coconut with bacon salt on them? Absolutely ghastly.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first second and a half you get the taste of bacon then you get very much soggy coconut ...

There are even vegan fast-food chains. It is easy to be an unhealthy vegan, if you\u2019re not careful.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Woolworths said it had seen \u201cdouble digit growth for plant-based meat alternatives in our stores over the past year, and every indication tells us this category will only continue to grow\u201d.</p> <p>Coles says sales of its Beyond Meat and Alternative Meat Co products had seen \u201cdouble-digit growth week-on-week over the past month\u201d. The share price of the US-owned Beyond Meat <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/beyond-meat-stock-price-up-475-since-pricing-ipo-2019-6\">rose 475% in the first month since its initial public offering in May</a>.</p> <p>But processed vegan and vegetarian options are not without environmental impact. Almond plantations are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/26/tough-nut-to-crack-the-almond-boom-and-its-drain-on-the-murray-darling\">drawing huge amounts of water out of the overtaxed Murray-Darling basin</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/soy-destruction-deforestation-in-argentina-leads-straight-to-our-dinner-plates\">Soybeans are driving deforestation</a>. Is it truly better, from a harm minimisation standpoint, to eat tofu than meat if the Amazon was cleared to grow the soybeans? A number of vegan-friendly products, including most frozen puff pastry sheets, use palm oil as a solid vegetable fat in place of butter. Can an orangutan\u2019s right to live undisturbed be weighed against that of a dairy cow?</p> <h2>\u2018Not a particularly difficult decision\u2019</h2> <p>For those trying to minimise their impact, each new piece of information must be plugged into a complex personal moral accounting.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to fix all of the inequities of this world through your own personal consumption decisions you\u2019ll go mad, because pretty much everything has exploitation and cruelty,\u201d Tasman Stacey says.</p> <p>\u201cBut when there are decisions that you can make, where I can make this slight change in the way we live, at no cost or ill-consequence to myself, and it does make an improvement to the world around us, then that\u2019s not a particularly difficult decision to take.\u201d</p> <p>Stacey and his family cut down their meat consumption from five or six days a week to one or two days a week last year. The meat they do eat is mostly game like kangaroo or deer, shot by Stacey when he can manage it \u2013 a harder proposition since he moved from northern Tasmania to Canberra.</p> <p>Just as Laidlaw did before she stopped eating meat, Stacey draws a distinction between ethically produced meat, like wild kangaroo or specialist small free-range meat producers, and large scale agriculture. If you\u2019re only eating meat once or twice a week, he says, you can afford a kinder product.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same argument run by Matthew Evans, the food critic who starred in the Gourmet Farmer television series, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-03/vegan-diet-doesnt-mean-no-animals-die-says-matthew-evans/11266420?pfmredir=sm\">in his latest book On Eating Meat</a>.</p> <p>The amount that Australians spend each week on meat has dropped in real terms since 1989. Eating less, higher quality and more ethically produced meat would have benefits for people, animals and the planet alike.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to not eat meat because eating meat is wrong,\u201d Stacey says. \u201cWe are eating less meat because it\u2019s not sustainable. There\u2019s enough resources on this world for everyone to live a comfortable and dignified life but the way that we distribute our resources globally at the moment is not sustainable, and we need to change that or get very used to the hordes of people being murdered at the border trying to escape climate catastrophe.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I try to be coherent in my own way of life and these products</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alice Belin, from Brussels, decided to reduce her meat consumption for environmental reasons last year and adopted a strict lacto-ovo vegetarianism because she says she hasn\u2019t the discipline for a more \u201cflexitarian\u201d approach.</p> <p>\u201cI like to eat and I like to eat meat and I miss it, so I knew that wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d she says. Christmas in France was spent mournfully looking at the foie gras and oysters and seeking solace in the cheese buffet.</p> <p>Belin works for a marine environmental organisation and gave up fish some years ago. She says she does not anticipate upgrading to vegan, partly because it would feel \u201cpunitive\u201d to remove cheese, and partly because it would necessarily increase her reliance on processed or soy-based products.</p> <p>\u201cI try to be coherent in my own way of life and these products, if they\u2019re made from an industrial process, in an industrial way, and bought in a supermarket in plastic packaging, to me that kind of cancels out the fact that I am not eating meat,\u201d Belin says.</p> <p>It must be a personal choice, she says.</p> <p>None of the people who spoke to Guardian Australia say they would try to persuade anyone else to give up meat. But if you are thinking about doing it, they say, it\u2019s really not that hard.</p>",

Two weeks later, he still hadn\u2019t eaten meat. \u201cI just said to myself then: look, if you can do it and you\u2019re not really missing anything (other than bacon) can you justify going back?\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I thought, I probably can\u2019t. If you\u2019re still enjoying sitting down to dinner then what\u2019s the point in reverting?\u201d Buchanan is probably not who the National party had in mind when it railed against the growth of fake-meat products in Australian supermarkets (although he agrees that it\u2019s confusing to shelve such products alongside real meat). A Liberal party staffer and former federal Liberal candidate, he says he is \u201cabout as far removed from being a bleeding heart small-l liberal as you could expect to find\u201d. But he is one of a growing number of Australians who have decided to cut down, or cut out, the meat or other animal products in their diet. According to research by Roy Morgan nearly 2.5m Australians, just over 12% of the population, said they ate vegetarian or primarily vegetarian diets in 2018, up from 2.2m in 2014. Despite that apparent trend, Australians are still the biggest meat consumers in the world: in 2014 the average Australian ate 116kg of meat per year, almost three times the global average of 43kg. Recent converts told Guardian Australia they were motivated by animal welfare concerns, anxiety over the climate crisis, concerns about factory farming and, in some cases, convenience. A number cited Dominion, a documentary by an Australian filmmaker connected to recent protests and trespass on agricultural properties that has been criticised as \u201cmisleading\u201d by the National Farmers Federation. No truck with fake meat products Attenborough was frequently cited as the catalyst. The 92-year-old is an amplifier for climate scientists who say beef consumption in western countries like Australia needs to fall by up to 90% to avoid a climate breakdown. Georgina Laidlaw watched a three-part Attenborough documentary on the Galapagos Islands before booking a holiday there in May 2015. She lives on a small acreage near Ballarat and began killing her own ducks and chickens for meat in 2007. She was \u201cmore in touch with the death part of eating meat than a lot of people\u201d, she says. But she couldn\u2019t reconcile those habits with her experience in the Galapagos. \u201cEvery day you are surrounded by animals there and you are busy taking photos of them and looking at them through binoculars and swimming with them and spending money to do specifically that, and then I would come back at night and eat the best ceviche of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d She already avoided mass-produced meat, but returned home as a vegetarian. The hardest part, she says, was overcoming her fear of being impolite by informing family and friends that they might have to cater separately to her. Thankfully the rise of foodie culture, and specifically the celebrity chef Yotam Ottolenghi, a longtime food columnist for the Guardian, has eased the way. Gone are the sludgy lentil soups that characterised western vegetarianism in the 1970s. Even meat eaters will happily cook an Ottolenghi concoction, or queue for trendy vegan restaurants such as Smith &amp; Daughters in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy. But while she has found being a vegetarian easy to manage, veganism is off the cards. \u201cIf I got rid of eggs and dairy I would be eating tofu at every turn, and that sounds like the title of a horror novel,\u201d she says. She has no truck with fake meat products. Buchanan, on the other hand, appears to have tried all of them. He can recommend the best burger (\u201cLinda McCartney, hands down\u201d) the best fake fish (\u201cQuorn have just brought out some absolutely lovely fish fillet options\u201d) and the best vegan bacon. The bacon was a sticking point. \u201cSomeone swore to me that coconut chips were the way to go,\u201d he says. \u201cLittle slices of coconut with bacon salt on them? Absolutely ghastly. \u201cFor the first second and a half you get the taste of bacon then you get very much soggy coconut ... I had so much trouble giving the tub away.\u201d (He says Lamyong bacon strips are \u201cpretty close, if you like your bacon overdone\u201d.) Tae Baker has been vegan for three months. She took a 30-day online challenge after seeing the Extinction Rebellion protests that shut down Flinders Street in Melbourne as part of its global day of action on climate. She says she didn\u2019t approve of their tactics, but was interested enough to learn more. While politicians from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, down branded protesters \u201cun-Australian\u201d and introduced new laws to increase penalties for \u201cmilitant vegans\u201d who trespass on farms and agricultural businesses, Baker was learning to swap Greek yoghurt for coconut or soy. \u201cI got a fair bit of ribbing from people, especially because it was shortly after the \u2018militant vegan\u2019 media attacks,\u201d she says. \u201cI had friends calling me \u2018my militant vegan friend\u2019, and things like that.\u201d The biggest challenge was overcoming her own belief that sticking to a vegan diet would be difficult. \u201cI always thought it was too hard, and I think you can live your whole life thinking it\u2019s too hard if you don\u2019t try it,\u201d she says. Instead, she says, it was \u201calmost too easy\u201d: vegans are now so well catered for in major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths that you can easily subsist on pre-made or processed foods. There are even vegan fast-food chains. It is easy to be an unhealthy vegan, if you\u2019re not careful. A spokesperson for Woolworths said it had seen \u201cdouble digit growth for plant-based meat alternatives in our stores over the past year, and every indication tells us this category will only continue to grow\u201d. Coles says sales of its Beyond Meat and Alternative Meat Co products had seen \u201cdouble-digit growth week-on-week over the past month\u201d. The share price of the US-owned Beyond Meat rose 475% in the first month since its initial public offering in May. But processed vegan and vegetarian options are not without environmental impact. Almond plantations are drawing huge amounts of water out of the overtaxed Murray-Darling basin. Soybeans are driving deforestation. Is it truly better, from a harm minimisation standpoint, to eat tofu than meat if the Amazon was cleared to grow the soybeans? A number of vegan-friendly products, including most frozen puff pastry sheets, use palm oil as a solid vegetable fat in place of butter. Can an orangutan\u2019s right to live undisturbed be weighed against that of a dairy cow? \u2018Not a particularly difficult decision\u2019 For those trying to minimise their impact, each new piece of information must be plugged into a complex personal moral accounting. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to fix all of the inequities of this world through your own personal consumption decisions you\u2019ll go mad, because pretty much everything has exploitation and cruelty,\u201d Tasman Stacey says. \u201cBut when there are decisions that you can make, where I can make this slight change in the way we live, at no cost or ill-consequence to myself, and it does make an improvement to the world around us, then that\u2019s not a particularly difficult decision to take.\u201d Stacey and his family cut down their meat consumption from five or six days a week to one or two days a week last year. The meat they do eat is mostly game like kangaroo or deer, shot by Stacey when he can manage it \u2013 a harder proposition since he moved from northern Tasmania to Canberra. Just as Laidlaw did before she stopped eating meat, Stacey draws a distinction between ethically produced meat, like wild kangaroo or specialist small free-range meat producers, and large scale agriculture. If you\u2019re only eating meat once or twice a week, he says, you can afford a kinder product. It\u2019s the same argument run by Matthew Evans, the food critic who starred in the Gourmet Farmer television series, in his latest book On Eating Meat. The amount that Australians spend each week on meat has dropped in real terms since 1989. Eating less, higher quality and more ethically produced meat would have benefits for people, animals and the planet alike. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to not eat meat because eating meat is wrong,\u201d Stacey says. \u201cWe are eating less meat because it\u2019s not sustainable. There\u2019s enough resources on this world for everyone to live a comfortable and dignified life but the way that we distribute our resources globally at the moment is not sustainable, and we need to change that or get very used to the hordes of people being murdered at the border trying to escape climate catastrophe.\u201d Alice Belin, from Brussels, decided to reduce her meat consumption for environmental reasons last year and adopted a strict lacto-ovo vegetarianism because she says she hasn\u2019t the discipline for a more \u201cflexitarian\u201d approach. \u201cI like to eat and I like to eat meat and I miss it, so I knew that wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d she says. Christmas in France was spent mournfully looking at the foie gras and oysters and seeking solace in the cheese buffet. Belin works for a marine environmental organisation and gave up fish some years ago. She says she does not anticipate upgrading to vegan, partly because it would feel \u201cpunitive\u201d to remove cheese, and partly because it would necessarily increase her reliance on processed or soy-based products. \u201cI try to be coherent in my own way of life and these products, if they\u2019re made from an industrial process, in an industrial way, and bought in a supermarket in plastic packaging, to me that kind of cancels out the fact that I am not eating meat,\u201d Belin says. It must be a personal choice, she says. None of the people who spoke to Guardian Australia say they would try to persuade anyone else to give up meat. But if you are thinking about doing it, they say, it\u2019s really not that hard.",

The \u201cmember for Sky\u2019s\u201d regular appearances had become a running joke in Canberra, particularly as the outspoken conservative helped hammer the final nails into Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministerial casket. The ability of a relatively unknown backbencher to have exerted such influence through pay TV was particularly remarkable given Sky has so few viewers. Indeed, its most popular programs \u2013 Andrew Bolt and Paul Murray \u2013 secure an average audience on any weeknight of around 30,000. Peta Credlin\u2019s daily show, Credlin, is regularly outranked by repeats of Peppa Pig. Add into the equation that the average age of a Sky viewer is in the mid-70s, and its difficult to understand why MPs bother. The prime minister\u2019s office appears to have had the same brainwave. In the last week of June, Morrison\u2019s media unit ran an informal audit, finding that in the space of just six days, 29 government MPs appeared as talking heads on Sky. MPs and senators were talking about all sorts of things. The news of the day, mostly, sticking to feelpinions and talking points, with the occasional catchy grab kicking the story along until the next news bulletin. But it was all white noise. Morrison has now issued an edict, effectively telling MPs: less talk, more action. MPs were given the order at the first partyroom meeting of the new parliament, but Morrison has made his views clear countless times about what he believes the Australian people expect of the executive. Shut your collective trap, and go and do your jobs. He makes a fair point. Politicians in Canberra, including many of Morrison\u2019s colleagues, have been obsessed for years by internal ideological divisions and personality clashes rather than their actual job of serving the Australian people. Turnbull expressed frustration at the same thing back in 2015 when he urged his colleagues to get over themselves and focus on the job at hand. \u201cThe less we talk about ourselves and the more we talk about the people who elect us the better,\u201d he said.

The past fortnight has seen ministers Ken Wyatt, Anne Ruston, Jane Hume and Karen Andrews take the leading role for their respective portfolio matters. Morrison is taking a leaf out of the playbooks of Bob Hawke and John Howard, believing he needs his cabinet to shine for the government to ultimately succeed. As the Hawke cabinet minister Kim Beazley described in his eulogy for the former PM in June: \u201cHe told each of his ministers, \u201cYou know the policy, you know your resources, you proceed.

But while the \u201cpolitics off the front page\u201d pitch is part of the strategy, Morrison also seems determined to bypass the media and talk directly to voters as much as possible. Following the well-trod path of Donald Trump and Pauline Hanson before him, Morrison has declared war on the \u201cCanberra bubble\u201d, taking to social media to directly communicate to voters while accusing the media of being out of step with the concerns of everyday Australians. It is the same bubble that Morrison declared he had \u201cpopped\u201d with his election win (which he observed, perhaps somewhat ironically, on Sky News the day after his victory), and one which he is attempting to starve of some oxygen by reining in his most loquacious MPs. There is some merit in his criticisms of federal political reporting. Most participants are happy to acknowledge its shortcomings: there is too much focus on conflict, too little interest in policy, and an unfortunate culture \u2013 cultivated by politicians, Morrison included \u2013 of \u201cdropping\u201d stories to friendly media. But if Morrison is genuine about wanting to reform the culture of the derided \u201cbubble\u201d to ensure that journalists and MPs both share a laser-like focus on the Australian people, then there should be some acknowledgment that successive governments have made the job of public interest journalism more difficult.

      "bodyText": "Well, that was an unexpected blast. Heartache for Rory McIlroy, but it was a wonderful day for another Irish star, Shane Lowry, who went out in 31 strokes and grabbed himself a share of the lead at the halfway mark. Moving Day promises to be one heck of a ride, with many of golf\u2019s biggest names in with a realistic shout of glory on Sunday. We leave you with a snapshot of the top of the leaderboard, followed by a list of the big names who\u2019ll be missing this weekend. Thanks for reading. Nighty night! -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Smith, Harding, Rose -5: Koepka, Spieth, Putnam, Frittelli -4: Van Rooyen, Finau, Bjerregaard, Reed, Rahm, Kuchar -3: Hatton, D Johnson, Noren, Simpson, Stenson, Schauffele, Fowler -2: An, Sabbatini, Pieters, Olesen, Els, Fitzpatrick, MacIntyre Missing the cut (a selection): Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker, Beef, Padraig Harrington, Gary Woodland, Hideki Matsuyama, Kim Si-woo, Zach Johnson, Paul Lawrie, Bryson DeChambeau, Tiger Woods, Ian Poulter, Phil Mickelson, Adam Scott, David Duval (well, y\u2019know) and ... Rory McIlroy. It\u2019s no longer possible for the cut line to move. It never looked likely. Everyone at +2 and over will be on their way home. Rory\u2019s dream is officially over. How he\u2019ll be wishing the Open still had its old ten-shot rule. Here, hope amid all that drama you haven\u2019t forgotten about David Duval. The extremely likeable 2001 champion ends the week well adrift at the bottom on +27, much as you\u2019d expect after yesterday\u2019s +20 farce incorporating that nonuple-bogey 14. He started his second round today 5-8, and reached the turn in 44. More of the same? Not quite. Because after all that misery, he came home in one-under 34, his final act of defiance a birdie at 17. Of course he did. Of course it was. Golf in all it\u2019s glory and magnificence, right there. It\u2019s why we love it. A highly emotional Rory McIlroy talks to Sky, and the heart melts. \u201cPart of me is very disappointed not to be here for the weekend.\u201d He nearly dissolves into tears, and has to take a minute. He blows out hard. \u201cSorry. Part of me disappointed, emotional, but happy with how I played. The support I got was incredible. You could see on the back nine, if I\u2019d got that momentum a little bit yesterday ... and I went with it today ... that was what I was planning to do all week. But yesterday gave me a big mountain to climb. I dug in there, I tried my best, and I showed resilience. It\u2019s gonna hurt for a little bit. [sighs] But I guess the good thing about golf is that I\u2019ve got a tournament in Memphis next week, so I\u2019ll turn my attention to that. This has been a week that I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a long time [voice cracks a little] and I didn\u2019t play my part. But everyone in Northern Ireland who came out to watch me, they definitely played theirs.\u201d At which point Sky interviewer Tim Barter nearly goes as well. Then one last thought. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to watch Shane Lowry over the weekend. He\u2019ll get the support I got today, and hopefully he\u2019ll will them on. I\u2019d love nothing more than to see Shane get his name on that Claret Jug.\u201d A birdie chance for Rickie Fowler on 18. It slides by the left of the cup, but he\u2019ll take that par. He follows up yesterday\u2019s 70 with a 69, and at -3 he\u2019s only five off the lead. The new US Open champion Gary Woodland will certainly be missing the cut. A closing bogey, and he departs, finishing his week at +3. McIlroy then tidies up for par, and a valiant round of 65. The gallery cheer as though he\u2019s just won the Open. It\u2019s an almost unbearable moment of bittersweet failure. What an effort, though. What spirit. What fight. But yesterday\u2019s fiasco will keep him awake for a while tonight. If he chips this in, it\u2019ll be shades of Costantino Rocca at St Andrews in 1995. He wastes no time. He clips a chip up onto the green. It\u2019s always heading left. Pin high, and he\u2019s got to save his par to retain a sliver of hope. But even then he\u2019ll be relying on a statistically unlikely set of circumstances to move the cutline to +2. Up on the green, the defending champ Francesco Molinari pars. Today\u2019s 69 means he\u2019ll scrape under the cut line. He\u2019s +1. Can McIlroy, back down the fairway, join him? It\u2019s not looking likely, sad to say. He fires a long iron at the flag. A little too much draw, and his ball disappears down a swale to the left of the green. He\u2019ll need to chip in now, across wobbly terrain. Or make par, and hope four of the six players still out there, and above the cut line, crumble coming home. It\u2019s not looking likely, and his expression tells the story. And yet Northern Ireland\u2019s four-time major winner is awarded a standing ovation as he walks up to the green. It\u2019s the scene he\u2019ll have been dreaming of ever since he was a young boy. Sadly, it\u2019s happening on Friday afternoon as opposed to Sunday. How McIlroy will be wishing he didn\u2019t rush that tiddler on 16 yesterday. That could end up being the difference. Yes, yes, the opening quadruple bogey and the closing triple were bigger disasters, but you get the gist. In do-or-die mode, he clacks an iron into the meaty part of the 18th fairway. Two shots from a strange kind of glory. McIlroy faces a putt with a little right-to-left movement, but not that much. He doesn\u2019t allow for any break, and it rolls off apologetically to the left. Just a par. One chance left to secure his weekend participation. He tugs anxiously at his bottom lip. The tension is practically unbearable. And it\u2019s some shot! He lashes through the thick grass, and lands his ball just to the left of the bunker guarding the green. Just a couple of feet from sandy disaster. The ball then breaks to the right and trundles into the heart of the green. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from about 15 feet! That is magnificent in the circumstances. But there\u2019s still a putt to make. By rights, there should only be this sort of tension at the Open on Sunday afternoon. But Rory McIlroy\u2019s Homeric attempts to save his skin after yesterday\u2019s implosion have sent the Portrush crowd into a flat spin. Anticipation, concern, panic, excitement, the whole shebang. So what sort of lie has he got down the right of 17? Well ... it\u2019s in the thick stuff, and it\u2019s not the worst lie in the circumstances: the ball\u2019s sitting up a bit, though there\u2019s a big clump of grass behind it. He\u2019s going to take it on, despite a bunker in between ball and target. Jason Kokrak has only played in one Open Championship before. He missed the cut last year. But this time round he\u2019s squeaked in, rolling in a 30-footer for a birdie on 18 that takes him to +1. Great scenes of celebration. Not so many back on the 17th tee, where McIlroy flays a wild drive into the thick green stuff down the right. The gallery falls into pensive silence. So much for so many depends on the lie. Rory paces around his putt. This is huge! You can hear a gull land softly on the Giant\u2019s Causeway. Then, not so much, as the air crackles with ear-splitting delight! He rolls a practically straight putt into the cup, and allows himself a small air-punch of delight. He just requires one more birdie to make his weekend participation certain! He\u2019s +2 ... which might make it anyway if the cut moves out. It\u2019s going to be tight, with a few players still out there hovering either side of the line. McIlroy sends a quite sensational draw into the long par-three 16th. His ball curls in from the right and drops pin high, ten feet to the left of the flag. That\u2019s a superb chance for the birdie he so desperately requires, on the hole that\u2019s playing third hardest today. McIlroy blooters a huge drive down 15. So long that he\u2019s left with an awkward distance to wedge in. He overcooks it, sending his ball bounding into the pot bunker to the left of the green. But the splash out offers an opportunity to hole out. A delicate effort teases the crowd but is always missing on the right. Still, he\u2019s saved par and at +3 with three holes to play, a quite frankly absurd dream lives on. The current cut is +1. He needs two birdies as things stand. Xander Schauffele paces around his 30-footer. The left-to-right line is perfect, but he doesn\u2019t quite hit it. Par will do, and that equals the best-of-week 65s by JB Holmes and Justin Harding. Flawless brilliance. Last year\u2019s joint runner-up goes into the weekend three off the lead at -3. Pars for Henrik Stenson and Graeme McDowell too. They finish the second round at -3 and +1 respectively. All three will take their pars quite happily. G-Mac puffs out hard; survival meant so much to this local lad. Schauffele and Stenson have their eyes on a bigger prize. Stenson, McDowell and Schauffele come up the last. Stenson clips his second to 15 feet. G-Mac - who needs a par to remain at +1 and survive the cut - follows him in. A couple of fine strokes. Schauffele, who had hit by far the best tee shot and is a good way closer to the green, pushes his second well right. He\u2019s pin high and on the green, but facing a much longer birdie putt. What a bounce-back birdie for McIlroy at 14! His putt is pretty much straight up the green. He rolls the ball just a smidgen to the left, but not so much that the cup doesn\u2019t snatch it down as it reaches the lip. The sky crackles with static as the gallery whoops and hollers in celebration. Their hero is back to +3, just a couple of birdies away from making it to the weekend. If he pulls this off, it\u2019ll be one of the most astonishing 24-hour turnarounds in form you\u2019re likely to see in quite a while. Another birdie for Rickie Fowler! A glorious tee shot at 13 to six feet. In goes the putt, and he\u2019s suddenly -3, just five off the lead. And the super Schauffele shuffle up the leaderboard continues. A big drive down 17, a Scottish-style low bump and run to 12 feet, and a right-to-left slider for another birdie! He\u2019s -3 too. A birdie down the last, and he\u2019d be signing for a best-of-week 64. McIlroy has his work cut out after that bogey at 13. He sets about attempting to repair the damage immediately on 14, by landing a towering approach 12 feet short of the flag. A great chance for birdie. Meanwhile bogey for Kisner on 13, mere minutes after talking him up. Sorry, Kevin. He slips to -2. Rickie Fowler\u2019s not out of this Open yet. He\u2019s been quiet all day, but he trundles in a 30-footer on 12, and the birdie takes him up to -2. There are an awful lot of players still in with a shout of this championship. Meanwhile his playing partner Kevin Kisner also birdies the hole. He\u2019s really turned his round through 180 degrees, having bogeyed 2 and 4. A ludicrous eagle on 7, rattled in from distance, has been followed by birdies at 9 and now 12. He\u2019s -3. Easy to forget that Kisner led this tournament for three days last year, before a final round of 74 put paid to his hopes. He\u2019s also got near misses at the PGA and the Players on his CV. Can last year\u2019s joint runner-up go one better this time round? Rory\u2019s got a decent lie in the sand. He shuffles his feet, bends his knees, opens the face, and splashes out. It\u2019s a nice escape, but the ball trundles 15 feet past the cup. He\u2019ll need that for a par. A huge moment coming up. But he\u2019s quickly up and after his putt, knowing full well it\u2019s short and right. His first bogey today, and he slips back to +4. Suddenly, with only six holes left to play, things are getting very tight now. As if they weren\u2019t already. Meanwhile up on 18, the young Scottish prospect Robert MacIntyre misses a short putt. Bogey, and that\u2019s a one-over 72 today. He\u2019s -2 overall. Par for Beef meanwhile. His 71 means he\u2019s +2, with half a chance of making the cut. Hmm. Rory\u2019s first misstep for a wee while. He slam-dunks his tee shot at the par-three 13th into a pot bunker front right. Providing the lie is OK, scrambling par shouldn\u2019t be beyond him, but that\u2019s far from ideal. While we wait to see what\u2019s what, a reminder of the state of play at the top of the leader board, with everyone at the business end back in the clubhouse. -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Smith, Harding, Rose -5: Koepka, Spieth, Putnam, Frittelli -4: Van Rooyen, Finau, Bjerregaard, Reed, Rahm, Kuchar McIlroy can\u2019t make his eagle putt - it\u2019s always missing on the right - but it\u2019s a tap-in for birdie. He\u2019s now five under for today\u2019s round, +3 overall, just two shots shy of saving himself, and what on earth was he up to yesterday?!? The next couple of hours: excitement, thrills and spills pretty much guaranteed! Rory isn\u2019t the only man on the march, though. Xander Schauffele was one of the pre-tournament favourites, and no wonder, because the 25-year-old Californian\u2019s record in the majors isn\u2019t too dissimilar from Brooks Koepka\u2019s at a similar age. In other words: something\u2019s afoot, and it might just be a matter of time. He carded a shockingly poor 75 yesterday, but he\u2019s wheeching back up the standings apace. Birdies at 7 and 8, an eagle at 12, and now another birdie at 15. He\u2019s -2 ... and only six off the lead! If he can pick up another shot or two, he\u2019ll really fancy his chances going into the weekend. He\u2019ll still be confident if he can par his way home, but you get the point. Thanks Niall. Well, the end to Dylan Frittelli\u2019s round was a bit of an anti-climax. That 6-5 finish turned a very fine round into a still-decent 69. But plenty of good work was undone at the death. He\u2019s -5. Meanwhile the Rory revival continues apace. After blootering a monster drive down 12, he only needed a gap wedge into the par-five green. He sends his ball over the flag, and though it doesn\u2019t spin back much, he\u2019s got a 20-footer left for eagle. If that goes in, things are going to get very real quite soon. Ah, unlucky for Frittelli, who leaves himself a monster uphill putt for par \u2013 and rolls it to the very edge of the cup! Ultimately, it\u2019s another bogey, and the South African drops down to a share of eighth place. And with that, I\u2019ll hand you back to Scott... It could have been worse, but this is an awkward lie for Frittelli. The ball is on a bank, surrounded by long grass. He digs his approach shot into the roll-off area behind the final green. Could\u2019ve been worse. McIlroy tees off at the par-five 12th, and creams his shot right-to-left, dodging a couple of big bunkers and finding the fairway. Another birdie for McIlroy! He can make this game look so easy, and so difficult, depending on his mood. Two birdies to begin the back nine \u2013 he probably needs another three to make the cut. Off the final tee, Frittelli lets out a yelp of frustration as another shot careens into the rough. Too much for Frittelli to do on the 17th, and he has to settle for a double bogey and a drop down the leaderboard. On the 14th, Henrik Stenson pushes his par putt within an inch, but will slip back to -3, his chances of creeping to the top of the leaderboard fading. -8: Holmes (F), Lowry (F) -7: Fleetwood (F), Westwood (F) -6: Frittelli (17), Smith (F), Harding (F), Rose (F) Frittelli is in a spot of bother on the 17th, losing his ball off the first tee shot, and landing the second in the rough! His fourth shot on the par four is steered tidily onto the green, so he may escape with just a bogey \u2013 but will lose his share of the lead. Meanwhile the defending champion, Francesco Molinari, drains a birdie at the 11th and is now even, and looking good to make the cut. Rory\u2019s comeback continues! He notches a birdie on the 10th, and is back down to five over. The cut will be +1, maybe +2, so there\u2019s still work to do to sneak into the weekend. A few words from Shane Lowry: \u201cI had a great time today. I was pinching myself out there - the crowds were fantastic, it was a day to remember. I birdied the first two, and the first tee shot set me up \u2026 I knew the rain was coming in later, so I had to make a good start. \u201cObviously I\u2019m disappointed with the end, but I\u2019m in a great position and looking forward to tomorrow. I\u2019m playing well, I feel like my game\u2019s where it needs to be. There\u2019ll be pressure, times I\u2019ll get out of position, but next week I\u2019ll be in Memphis, with two men and a dog watching, so I\u2019m happy having a big Irish crowd roaring me on!\u201d Can Dylan Frittelli grab the outright lead? As Scott mentioned earlier, he only grabbed a place in the field by winning the John Deere Classic last week. At the 16th, he rattles in a par putt from eight feet to stay level with Holmes and Lowry. An errant approach shot leaves Lowry with just too much to do, and he sends his par putt inches wide. He joins JB Holmes on eight under in the clubhouse, but might feel a touch disappointed not to have the outright lead. Shane Lowry heads to the 18th green, and gets a rapturous reception from the Portrush faithful. Mickelson finishes with a long-range birdie, trimming his score to eight over, still a long old way from the cut. Thanks Scott, and hello everyone. Here\u2019s a stat to kick things off \u2013 this is the 83rd major where Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have both started \u2013 and will be the first time they both fail to make the cut. They\u2019ll always have Vegas. Yep, Dylan Frittelli is in form all right. His sends his second at 15 to six feet, then makes his fifth birdie of the day. He\u2019s one off the top, the lead still held by Shane Lowry after he clipped a crisp chip up the bank, nearly holing out for an outrageous birdie. Par will do. -9: Lowry (17) -8: Holmes (F), Frittelli (15) -7: Fleetwood (F), Westwood (F) And with that, I\u2019m off to grease my pan with a couple of rashers. Back in a wee while, but in the meantime, Niall McVeigh is, like a pint of plain, your only man. Lowry takes his sweet time to plan his second shot. If you squinted you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching the notoriously snail-paced JB Holmes in action. Though he is leading the Open, to be fair. Finally he takes his shot ... and sends a big one booming through the green and over the back. He\u2019ll have a tricky up and down from the bottom of a bank. Meanwhile up on 18, Andrew Putnam makes par, and signs for a round of 67. One eagle, two birdies, no bogeys. After a tie for fourth at last week\u2019s Scottish Open, he is, like Dylan Frittelli, a man in form. He\u2019s -5. Lowry\u2019s tee shot has landed near the 18th tee. He\u2019ll get relief from some spectator barriers, and will take his drop on grass trampled flat by the punters. He\u2019s 130 yards from the green. A huge break. So having said that, the leader does still seem a little flustered. He sends a hysterical slice into the punters down the right of 17, then starts effin\u2019 and jeffin\u2019 in the lyrical style. He\u2019s in the lap of the gods there, because it looked as though that drive caromed off some poor bugger\u2019s noggin, and it could have gone anywhere. Another extremely staunch par save by Shane Lowry! His chip out of the cabbage isn\u2019t particularly good, running hot, five feet past. This is more missable than the one he didn\u2019t make at 14 ... but he guides this one in. Nerves of steel. He remains a shot clear of JB Holmes, at -9. The defending champion Francesco Molinari was wandering around with a face on. A three-over-par 74 yesterday, and pars through the first six holes today. At which point his caddy told him to snap out of his funk and get his chin up. That\u2019s some fine psychology, because since then Molinari has carded back-to-back birdies, the latest the result of a lovely approach to kick-in distance at 8. He\u2019s +1, and while hopes of becoming the first player to retain this title since Padraig Harrington in 2008 look extremely unlikely, he\u2019s moving in the right direction and is now above the cut line. Lowry just wants to get back to the clubhouse. His early-round mojo has deserted him. His tee shot into the par-three 16th, Calamity, snags in the rough to the right of the green. It\u2019s not a total disaster, as he\u2019s not miles from the flag and only just in the long stuff. But there\u2019s still work to do if he\u2019s to get up and down for his par. OK, these are crucial moments for Shane Lowry. He\u2019s coming off bogey at 14, and has pulled his approach at 15 into greenside sand. There\u2019s not a lot of green to play with. From wet sand, so badly raked that he complains to the referee, Lowry flops out delicately to three feet. That\u2019s a fine result from where he\u2019d found himself, and it salvages his par. It would have been easy for the head to go there, but Lowry composed himself brilliantly. Meanwhile another birdie for Rory McIlroy, this time at 7. He\u2019s +6 ... and if the cut moves out to +2, you never know, he could make the weekend yet. Dylan Frittelli sends his tee shot at 13 pin high, albeit a good 30 feet to the left of the flag. A little bit more oomph, and the birdie putt would have dropped, but it\u2019s just a par and he remains two off the lead at -7. Earlier today - at 12.47pm to be precise - we discussed the last bearded winner of the Open. Frittelli is sporting some very hip eye glasses. So should he win, the question will need to be asked: who was the last Open champion to sport specs? Ian Baker-Finch, is who, back in 1991. The sunglasses worn by David Duval (2001) don\u2019t count. Lowry\u2019s first putt across the 14th lacks a little pace. He\u2019s left himself with a testing five-footer for his par. And it\u2019s a costly mistake, as he sends his putt to the right, expecting a kink back left that never comes. His first bogey of the day. Meanwhile Frittelli is an inch away from rolling in an eagle putt at 12. He kicks in for birdie that brings him to within two shots of the lead. -9: Lowry (14) -8: Holmes (F) -7: Fleetwood (F), Westwood (F), Frittelli (12) Lowry\u2019s drive at 14 isn\u2019t all that, sneaking off the fairway and into the rough on the left. But he thrashes an approach into the heart of the green nonetheless. He\u2019ll not be expecting to make birdie from where he is, but he\u2019d have taken this outcome when he was observing his ball arcing towards the cabbage from the tee box. A par for the Irish amateur James Sugrue up the last. He signs for a second-round 73. That\u2019s put him at +2, currently just outside the cut. A triple-bogey seven at 14 may have cost him. But it may not. There\u2019s a fair chance the cut will move out to +2, in which case Sugrue and his fellow amateur, Takumi Kanaya of Japan, also at +2, will battle it out over the weekend for the silver medal. Fingers crossed. But sadly Darren Clarke won\u2019t be there. He leaves a long bogey putt short, then shoves the double-bogey effort right of the hole. A dreadful miss that causes audible shock in the stands ... because at +3, the 2011 champion and Royal Portrush member won\u2019t be teeing it up this weekend. He storms off to the scorer\u2019s hut, clearly upset, desperate to get out of here. Henrik Stenson snatches at a short par putt on 8. He slips back to -2. McIlroy misses a short birdie putt at 5, and his dreams of a sensational salvage job are beginning to look very wild. He remains at +7. But how about this from Dylan Frittelli?! The 29-year-old from South Africa was the last man to grab a place at this Open, winning the John Deere last weekend. And he\u2019s taken that good form to County Antrim. A 68 yesterday, and he\u2019s on course for a similar round today. Birdie at 2 has been followed up by back-to-back birdies at 10 and 11. He\u2019s -6, currently in a tie for fifth. Lowry\u2019s birdie effort is always missing on the high side. Another par. His upward momentum has slowed. But there are worse places to tread water than two clear at the top of the famous yellow Open scoreboard. He remains at -10. Grace converts his birdie chance, though, deserved reward for his wonderful tee shot. Branden Grace is this close to becoming the second player, after Emiliano Grillo yesterday, to make a hole-in-one at 13. But instead of bounding straight into the cup, it takes a little kick off to the left. He\u2019s left with a three-footer for birdie. His effort makes Shane Lowry\u2019s most acceptable tee shot, landed softly 12 feet from the flag, look completely average by comparison. Birdie chance coming up, though! A nice steady start for the 2016 champion Henrik Stenson. He follows up birdie at 3 with another at the par-five 7th. He\u2019s -3 and will be revving up for a leaderboard charge, weather permitting. It\u2019s still a little drizzly, but the wind\u2019s not a huge factor, so all\u2019s well at the moment. Time to reflect on the big picture. -10: Lowry (12) -8: Holmes (F) -7: Fleetwood (F), Westwood (F) -6: Smith (F), Harding (F), Rose (F) -5: Koepka (F), Spieth (F), Putnam (13), Frittelli (10) -4: Van Rooyen (F), Finau (F), Bjerregaard (F), Reed (F), Rahm (F), Kuchar (F), Fitzpatrick (13), Noren (11) Lowry\u2019s putt teases the gallery, briefly looking like it\u2019s heading straight in. But it soon slides off to the left. A tap-in for par, and at -10 he remains two clear of the clubhouse leader JB Holmes. But this is statistically the easiest hole on the course today - it\u2019s offered up three eagles and 51 birdies so far - and that\u2019s an opportunity to extend his lead passed by. The approach to blame. Lowry does extremely well to fire a bump-and-run out of the thicket, up and onto the green. The ball even bites a little as it threatens to roll hysterically past the hole. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet coming back. Back on 4, McIlroy lands his second 12 feet behind the hole, but his putt, a left-to-right curler, simply refuses to take the last turn. He remains at +7. A little bit of trouble for the leader at 12. Lowry\u2019s drive was perfect, in the middle of the fairway, but he\u2019s pulled his second into some mutant curly kale down the left. Par should be eminently makeable from there, as he\u2019s got plenty of green to play with, though much will depend on the lie. As Lowry tees it up on the par-five 12th, Andrew Putnam shows the leader what to do up on the green. He creams his approach to six feet, then strokes in for an eagle. Throw in birdies at 1 and 10, and the 30-year-old from Washington state is going along very nicely at -5. Meanwhile his compatriot Kevin Streelman shot a miserable six-over 77 yesterday. So he\u2019s responded today with a six-under 65, matching Justin Harding\u2019s best round of the week. He\u2019s level par going into the weekend. Something for Rory to chew on, then ... and he responds by holing a tramliner across 3 for a rare birdie. He\u2019s +7 and won\u2019t be giving up the ghost quite yet, despite it all. Branden Grace had amused the crowd on 10 when he theatrically milked some applause for a birdie, knowing full well the gallery is only really concerned with the antics of Shane Lowry. All in good humour. He doesn\u2019t hit a 15-footer on 11, though, spurning the chance of back-to-back birdies. He remains at -2. His partner Lowry was a little tentative with his longer birdie effort, as well, though he tidies up for par without too much drama. He\u2019s still two clear at -10. Lowry\u2019s wedge into 11 briefly threatens to bound into the thick rough behind the green, but bites hard on its second bounce and spins back onto the fringe. He\u2019ll putt from there, and will have half a chance of birdie. That\u2019s the currency McIlroy needs to deal in, if he\u2019s to somehow save himself in one of the great feats of golfing escapology. So par on the relatively easy par-five 2nd doesn\u2019t go down so well. A grim look on his face. The super-fast start he\u2019ll have desired has eluded him. The weather\u2019s improving. The wind\u2019s dropped again, and while it\u2019s still raining, it\u2019s not quite as heavy as it was. Lowry whistles a fine drive down the left of the 11th fairway, clearly not of a mood to take his foot off the gas. Elsewhere, Matthew Fitzpatrick has hit the turn in a blemish-free 33 strokes, after making birdies at 2, 4 and 7. He\u2019s -3 and 2013\u2019s low amateur is on the rise. Lowry drains a monster! His tee shot at 10 isn\u2019t all that, and he does very well to use all his power to lash his ball from thick rough onto the front edge of the green. A par isn\u2019t certain, as he\u2019s putting over the edge of a ridge down towards the hole. But he guides it in beautifully! Birdie! His sixth of the day! This is a quite majestic performance. The gallery erupt, as loud a holler as you\u2019ll hear on a golf course! If Portrush had a roof, it would have coptered off into the distance and taken Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge with it. -10: Lowry (10) -8: Holmes (F) -7: Fleetwood (F), Westwood (F) Rory\u2019s second into the 1st isn\u2019t particularly close to the flag. But he nearly sinks the long birdie putt. Ah well, par, and at least it\u2019s better than the quadruple bogey he ran up yesterday. If only he could have that hole back again. He remains at +8. Up on 18, par for Jon Rahm, who ends with a one-under 70 today. That was far from certain when he was melting down greenside at 2, running up an early double. He gathered himself well, a testament to his increasing maturity. He\u2019s -4 and nicely placed. Ditto his playing partner Matt Kuchar, who shot 68 today. While Tiger was taking his leave, Patrick Reed was making par and signing for a second round of 67. Last year\u2019s Masters champion is of the opinion that you can\u2019t claim to be a truly great golfer unless you make your mark in Europe as well as the States, and has put in some hard yards on the European Tour. It\u2019d be good to see his commitment pay dividends this week. It might be happening already. He\u2019s -4, positioned nicely ahead of the weekend. Bedlam on the opening tee as Rory McIlroy rocks up for what is presumably a valedictory performance. After yesterday\u2019s appalling 79, he\u2019ll be looking to right some wrongs, and make a statement before he has to leave his beloved Portrush earlier than anybody expected. And, well, you never know what might happen, stranger things have happened in sport. He\u2019s got a steely look in his eyes - they were flickering with nerves yesterda - and he shares a laugh with his playing partners as he bounces down the fairway after a fine opening tee shot. This could be entertaining. He\u2019s got nothing to lose. Shane Lowry knocks his approach at 9 pin high, though he\u2019s just on the fringe to the left. It\u2019s too much to ask for a sixth birdie on the front nine, so par it is. He turns in 31. Meanwhile Alex Noren is making a quiet move up the leaderboard. Birdies at 5 and 6, and an approach fired straight at the flag on 8. He can\u2019t make the birdie putt there, but he\u2019s -5. Tiger is short of 18 in two. He draws back the Texas wedge ... and leaves his putt miles short. It\u2019s been a miserable week for the reigning Masters champion, and it\u2019s going to be a denouement to match. Bogey, and that\u2019s a one-under 70 that, just for a while after the turn, hinted at a sensational cut-dodging feat of escapology. But it wasn\u2019t to be. He ends the week at +6. A sad look in the great man\u2019s eyes as he waves his cap and thanks the crowd for their support, which has never waned despite his poor showing this week. God speed, Tiger. Number 16 at Augusta next year, maybe. Shane Lowry has been relatively quiet since taking a share of the lead at 5. A makeable birdie putt missed at 6, then a par scramble up 7. But he\u2019s just eased a delightful short iron into 8, his ball screeching to a halt a couple of feet from the flag. He smiles broadly in the knowledge that sole ownership of the lead is his for the taking. And in goes the putt! A home hero leads the 148th Open! -9: Lowry (8) -8: Holmes (F) -7: Fleetwood (F), Westwood (F) -6: Smith (F), Harding (F), Rose (F) Jason Day was going along very nicely for a while. He was -4 through 12. But since then he\u2019s capitulated in spectacular fashion. Bogey, double bogey, bogey, bogey, bogey. Par at the last doesn\u2019t exactly cheer him up, and a 74 will most likely send him home tonight. He\u2019s +2. A wonder birdie for his partner Dustin Johnson, though. He drove into filth then powered his way out to 12 feet. In goes the left-to-right slider, and that\u2019s a brilliant 67! He\u2019s -3 going into the weekend. Tiger does pretty well to limit the damage at 17 to bogey. He\u2019s played well today, looking much less stiff than yesterday. He\u2019s two under for his round with a hole to play. But there was no coming back from that 78. At +5, he won\u2019t be here this weekend. It\u2019s a par for Justin Rose up the last. He\u2019ll be very happy to scribble his name at the bottom of a 67. A couple off the lead at -6. Lucas Bjerregaard gets in with par for a fine 68: he\u2019s -4. A shot dropped by Finau, though, and he stumbles into the clubhouse after three bogeys in the final six holes. But he\u2019s still posted 68-70, and if he gets his putting sorted, he could be a serious threat this weekend. He\u2019s -4. Tiger\u2019s given it his all. But it\u2019s over. On 17, he pulls his drive into the cabbage down the left, then sends his second into even thicker stuff by the green. He swipes his club through the air with great feeling and frustration. Already three shots below the cut line, it\u2019ll be a result to get out of this situation with a bogey, never mind a par. Blimey, the weather really has turned quicksmart. Umbrellas spring open, hoods are whipped up, the galleries hunker down. Plenty of rain. Very fine rain. Very wet rain. One reason Tony Finau will be happy to get back into the clubhouse. The other: he\u2019s been struggling over these closing holes. Bogey at 16, a short birdie putt missed at 17, and now he\u2019s flayed his drive at 18 into the oomska down the right. He\u2019s found his ball, but it\u2019ll be some chip-out medicine and nothing more. He seems at a loss for what to do. He asks the match referee whether one of the marshals stepped on his ball, because the lie is so appalling. But the marshal says he didn\u2019t. Finau accepts that without question or any sign of irritation. The perfect sportsman. He hacks out sideways, back onto the fairway, the best he could do. Justin Rose meanwhile makes the green in regulation. Lee Westwood sends his second into 18 to 20 feet. A decent birdie opportunity, a putt with not too much in the way of left-to-right movement. But he just doesn\u2019t hit it. Never mind, he\u2019ll be delighted to sign for a four-under 67, especially as it was all pars up until 11. He\u2019s tucked in just nicely ahead of Moving Day, and with the weather moving in - a bit more wind, and some rain coming down - the low scoring of the morning is unlikely to be replicated across the board. Yesterday\u2019s late starters, who became today\u2019s early starters, have definitely had the better of the weather. It\u2019s all part of the Open\u2019s charm. A bang-average 72 for Dustin Johnson yesterday. But he\u2019s been doing his best to salvage the week today. Birdies at 2, 4 and 6 saw him reach the turn in 33. He\u2019s level par on the back nine, with bogeys at 11 and 14, birdies at 12 and now the fiendish 16th. He\u2019s -2, not out of it by any means, though he wouldn\u2019t say no to a strong finish. Meanwhile up ahead, on the 17th green, Justin Rose and Tony Finau both turn their noses up at birdie putts within ten feet. They remain at -6 and -5 respectively. Par for JB Holmes up the last. It\u2019s a 68 to go alongside yesterday\u2019s 66. He\u2019s only opened a major with two sub-70 rounds once before, shooting a pair of 69s at Erin Hills in the 2017 US Open. He ended that one in 12th place. He\u2019s -8 going into the weekend. Meanwhile it\u2019s a 69 for the 2002 and 2012 champion Ernie Els! The Big Easy goes into the weekend at -2. A glorious birdie for Lee Westwood on 17. He\u2019s in a bit of trouble off the tee, in the long stuff to the left of the hole. But he powers his second towards the back of the green, then guides in a perfectly paced left-to-right curler from 20 feet. Back-to-back birdies, and his fourth in six holes! This is a proper Open bid now. A mere 37 holes away from banishing the demons of 2009, 2010 and 2013. Meanwhile a fuss-free par for Justin Rose at 16, but it\u2019s a Calamity three-putt bogey for his playing partner Tony Finau, who slips to -5. -8: Holmes (17), Lowry (5) -7: Fleetwood (F), Westwood (17) -6: Smith (F), Harding (F), Rose (16) Sergio\u2019s tee shot into the par-three 3rd topples down a run-off to the left. Inches away from staying on the green. But it\u2019s a thin line, and he can\u2019t get up and down from the swale. He\u2019s back to -3. Holmes meanwhile leaves himself a long two putts for par on 17. The first one\u2019s not given quite enough, but he makes the nerve-jangling five-footer that remains. He\u2019s only got a share of the lead now, though, because Lowry bashes his drive at the risk-and-reward short par-four 5th to the left of the green. A decent leave, and he gently lifts his lob wedge to kick-in distance. That very nearly dropped for eagle. But birdie will suffice, and the gallery responds accordingly! -8: Holmes (17), Lowry (5) -7: Fleetwood (F) -6: Smith (F), Harding (F), Westwood (16), Rose (16), Finau (15) Lee Westwood rakes home a monster from the fringe at the front of the par-three 16th! That\u2019s his third birdie in five holes. Everything else today has been par. The 46-year-old\u2019s dream of a late-career major is alive and well! He\u2019s -6, in a tie for fourth alongside his compatriot Justin Rose, who set about making a pig\u2019s lug of 15. A tee shot pushed right, then a couple of oddly weak chips. A 20-footer for par is then rammed into the cup. What a save! -8: Holmes (16) -7: Fleetwood (F), Lowry (4) -6: Smith (F), Harding (F), Westwood (16), Rose (15), Finau (15) Holmes very nearly gives up a shot carelessly on Calamity. His tee shot was decent enough, just off the green to the left. But he seriously overcooked his first putt, leaving one of eight feet coming back. He\u2019s missed a couple much shorter today. However this one drops. That\u2019s a great putt under the circumstances. He stays at -4. Lowry nearly makes his long birdie putt on 4, but he\u2019ll take par from where he found himself off the tee. Meanwhile another birdie for Patrick Reed, this time at 13, and he rises to -4. And Jon Rahm finally moves into red figures for his round today with a simple-enough birdie at the par-five 12th. He\u2019s -4 too. Pars at 12 and 13 for Tiger. A little bit of fire has gone out of his game in the last 20 minutes or so. With time running out, he\u2019ll need to rekindle quickly. On 4, Lowry hoicks a poor tee shot into the thick vegetation to the left of the hole. It doesn\u2019t look as though he\u2019s got a route into the green, with the pin tucked behind a mound on the left. But he fires a low shot into the front of the green, using the bank on the right to kick his ball back round into the heart of the dancefloor. Some local knowledge put to good use there. And he\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 25 feet or so. Justin Harding is home with a 65. It\u2019s the round of the week so far, and one that\u2019s catapulted the 33-year-old South African up to -6. His best finish at an Open is already guaranteed; his only previous effort was a missed cut at Muirfield back in 2013. Meanwhile only the second bogey of the week for Jason Day, at 13; he\u2019s back to -3. And Tony Finau sheds a shot at 13 to slip back to -5. Branden \u2018Mr 62\u2019 Grace, slayer of Birkdale and a major championship record of 44 years\u2019 standing, nearly aces 3. A gentle draw that nearly rolls in after a couple of bounces and a sweet roll. He\u2019ll tap in what\u2019s left for birdie and move to -1. His partner Shane Lowry meanwhile strokes his own putt into the cup for a perfect birdie-birdie-birdie start. The third member of the group, Phil Mickelson, must be looking on at Lowry\u2019s birdie blitz and reminiscing about long time ago when he was fab. A double at 2 has pretty much extinguished all hopes of Lefty making it to the weekend; he\u2019s +7. -8: Holmes (15) -7: Fleetwood (F), Lowry (3) -6: Smith (F), Harding (F), Rose (13) It\u2019s a birdie-birdie start for Lowry. A lovely third sent close, and he tidies up to move to -6 in short order. And his tee shot at the par-three 3rd is a beauty, pin high to ten feet. Back on 1, Sergio sends a lovely approach into the green, off the bank to the right, then curls in a left-to-right 25-footer for an opening birdie! He\u2019s -4. His playing partner Webb Simpson bumped one in to 12 feet, meanwhile, but he leaves the much shorter putt up on the high side. He stays at -3. But overall, the field is taking a piece out of Portrush right now. Cameron Smith shaves the hole at 18 with a birdie putt. No matter, he\u2019s signing for a 66, matching the lowest round of the week so far, shot by JB Holmes yesterday. He goes into the weekend at -6, looking good for Moving Day. Jason Day is trucking along nicely, meanwhile. Birdies at 2, 10 and now 12, and he\u2019s -4. Just the one dropped shot so far this week, at 18 last night. Now there\u2019s a player overdue a second major. He\u2019s -4, and looks to be in the mood to make up for his near miss at St Andrews in 2015. News of our beloved Tiger, who was surely kaput after dropping a shot at the par-five 7th. But he\u2019s hit the turn with a vengeance, making birdie at 10 and 11. At +4, he\u2019s still three shots shy of the projected cut at +1 ... but he couldn\u2019t somehow salvage this, could he? Put it this way, he\u2019s not going down without a fight. And you don\u2019t win 15 majors if you haven\u2019t got game. This could be fun. A three-putt bogey for JB Holmes at 14, as he shoves one right from close range. That\u2019s his second short one missed in six holes. His lead at the top is halved to one; he\u2019s -8, a shot ahead of Tommy Fleetwood, who is currently telling Sky Sports how important all those par scrambles were just before the turn. He\u2019s quietly content, as he should be. A long-anticipated major breakthrough could be just a couple of days away. -8: Holmes (14) -7: Fleetwood (F) This Open is really cooking now! Justin Rose, who had turned in 34, puts the pedal down by sending his second at 12 to ten feet, then knocking in the eagle putt. He\u2019s in a tie for third too. Back on 1, Shane Lowry makes an early statement with a birdie that gets him heading in the right direction in short order. Birdie for the quietly efficient Tony Finau at 12. And back-to-back birdies for Lee Westwood, at 12 and 13, and he\u2019s bothering the upper echelons of the leaderboard as well! There\u2019s still not a great deal of wind, so today\u2019s low scoring could continue for a while. -9: Holmes (13) -7: Fleetwood (F) -6: Smith (17), Harding (16), Rose (12), Finau (12), Bjerregaard (12) -5: Koepka (F), Spieth (F), Westwood (13), Lowry (1) Justin Harding\u2019s stunning run continues as he birdies 16. His long-handled putter is red hot. Since the turn, he\u2019s made five birdies, one par and one bogey. He\u2019s now tied for third at -6, alongside Lucas Bjerregaard, who nearly eagles 12. But birdie will do. Up ono 18, Jordan Spieth nearly makes a birdie, but makes do with par and a fine 67. The 2017 champ did well to keep that round from unravelling, because he was all over the place on the back nine. But he fought and scrambled and somehow managed to play those nine holes in level par. Birdie for Jon Rahm at 9, and after that double at 2, he\u2019s hitting the turn in level par for his round. He\u2019s back to -3. Eagle at 7 for Park Sang-hyun, whose one and only previous appearance in the majors resulted in a missed cut at last year\u2019s Open. There\u2019s just one letter of difference between his name and that of his compatriot Park Sung-hyun, one of the biggest stars on the LPGA Tour. That must play havoc with his search engine optimisation. Ireland\u2019s great hope for Open glory, Rory McIlroy Shane Lowry, is out and about! He sends his opening tee shot down the middle. He\u2019s got a bit of ground to make up today. One off the lead last night, he\u2019s now five off the pace, because JB Holmes has just registered back-to-back birdies, the latest coming at the par-three 13th. A tee shot clacked straight at the stick, albeit 20 feet short, then a putt gently guided into the cup with right-to-left grace. He\u2019s -9, two clear of second-placed Fleetwood. Holmes regains control of the Battle of the Beards with birdie at 12. He was inches away from rolling in a 25-footer for eagle. He\u2019s -8. In other razor-free news, Louis Oosthuizen birdies the last. It\u2019s a much-needed boost, given he\u2019d bogeyed 14, 16 and 17. He\u2019s level par. And Brooks Koepka pars 18 for a quiet 69 that\u2019ll do him no harm come the weekend. -8: Holmes (12) -7: Fleetwood (F) -6: Smith (16) -5: Koepka (F), Spieth (16), Harding (15), Finau (11), Bjerregaard (11) Closing birdie for Tommy Fleetwood, deserved reward for a lovely draw sent to 15 feet. The putt\u2019s stroked smoothly into the cup, and that\u2019s a superb second round of 67! He\u2019s the new clubhouse leader at -7 ... and he\u2019s the co-leader of the tournament as well, alongside JB Holmes. \u201cWith Holmes, Fleetwood and Shane Lowry all in good shape at the moment, what odds on a bearded champion golfer this year?\u201d wonders Declan Keane. \u201cDoes the facial insulation help keep the head and therefore also the brain, warmer, to contribute to course management, when playing links golf in the wind? And any idea who was the last Open winner with chin fluff?\u201d Extensive research (i.e. flicking through the R&amp;A\u2019s lovely guide while I should be watching the action) suggests there hasn\u2019t been a bearded winner since 1882, when Bob Ferguson took the title at St Andrews sporting an extremely wide goatee. No sides or moustache though, and a lack of hair on the upper lip might irk some purists. So with Willie Park Sr. (1875, Prestwick) similarly disqualified for lack of tache, despite having a dead sheep glued to his chin, we have to go right back to 1867, when Old Tom Morris triumphed at Prestwick with the full Santa arrangement. -7: Fleetwood (F), Holmes (11) -6: Smith (15) -5: Koepka (17), Spieth (16), Finau (10) A fine up and down from sand at 15 by Jordan Spieth, who in doing so bodyswerves back-to-back birdies. He remains at -5. Meanwhile up on 18, Tyrrell Hatton nearly drains a long birdie putt, but has to settle for par and a 71. A slight stumble coming home, with bogey at 14 followed by that double-bogey calamity at Calamity, but he\u2019ll be in good position going into Moving Day at -3. Once again he departs the scene all downcast - his only bogey yesterday came at 18 - but he\u2019s playing some fine golf and promises to be a factor this weekend. One of the cheers of the day as Darren Clarke, a member of this club, birdies 3. He moves into red figures. Away up on 17, Tommy Fleetwood responds to the bogey at Calamity by nearly draining a long birdie putt. Par will do to steady the ship, and he remains a shot off the lead at -6. And Justin Harding, the late-blooming South African who tied for 12th at this year\u2019s Masters, rakes in another birdie putt with his long flat stick. A third in four holes, and he\u2019s -5 for both round and tournament. Tiger had been trying his best to somehow stay alive this weekend. Birdie at 3, then another at 6. But a short par putt missed at 7 has almost certainly put paid to any lingering hope. He\u2019s back down at +6 now, and the cut is currently expected to send everyone at +2 and over home. Meanwhile a second bogey of the day for Spieth, always out of position on 14, but a second birdie in three holes for Justin Rose, rolling in a long one at 9. Spieth slips to -5, Rose rises to -4. Tiger is looking much more comfortable today, the troublesome back warmed by the rather pleasant temperatures. It\u2019s not exactly sunbathing weather but Woods cuts a happier figure this morning. Of course, it helps if the putter heats up too and, after draining a big one at the opening hole, he sinks a 20-footer at 6 to go -2 for the day. At +5 overall, he still looks maybe two or three shots away from the cut line but he\u2019s not giving this up easily. As if we would expect anything less from the 15-time major champ. A second bogey of the day for Fleetwood, who had whistled his tee shot at 16 into Hatton Territory. Unlike Tyrrell, who required three swishes to extricate himself from the jungle, Fleetwood whips out first time, high and onto the green. He\u2019s left with a 12-foot chance to save his par, but can\u2019t make it. So he drops out of the lead, which is the sole property of JB Holmes again. By the way, Holmes\u2019 bogey on 9 was a nonsense, a short, straight putt not given enough juice and stopping apologetically short. Meanwhile a fourth birdie in five holes for Cameron Smith, at 12; another birdie for Harding, coming behind, also at 12; and four birdies in five holes for the brilliant Patrick Reed, at 3, 4, 6 and now 7. This really is bubbling up nicely! -7: Holmes (10) -6: Fleetwood (16), Spieth (13), Smith (13) -5: Koepka (15) -4: Van Rooyen (F), Harding (12), Finau (8), Bjerregaard (8), Reed (7), Lowry Thanks David. This is really hotting up now! With little wind around Portrush, the course is there for the taking. And plenty of players are taking advantage. Tony Finau birdies 8 to move to -4. Lucas Bjerregaard has birdied 2, 7 and 8 to rise to -4. Justin Harding has risen to -3 after eagle at 7 and birdie at 10. Meanwhile Erik van Rooyen is back home after parring every hole on the back nine. Out in 33, that means he\u2019s signing for a 68, and is the early clubhouse leader at -4. How quickly fortunes switch. Tyrrell Hatton comes through his crisis moment by holing a brave 15-footer for bogey at 16 although there\u2019s just a little confusion as the scoreboard in the press tent is showing double. Did he take a drop that we didn\u2019t see? Meanwhile, Fleetwood blazes his tee-shot at that same 16th into deep rough. And to complete the ebb and flow at the top, Holmes makes his first mis-step of the day with a dropped shot at 9. Holmes now tied for the lead with Fleetwood. Just before I hand back to Scott, it emerges that Hatton did indeed take double at 16 so he\u2019s back to -3 overall. Right, back to Mr Murray for further drama. Hatton making a meal of 16. His tee-shot goes left into the dense cabbage and his first hack out moves more turf than ball. For a horrible moment, it looks as if he\u2019s simply pounded it further into the ground but a second chop finds the green. He\u2019s staring at double bogey though and you sense it\u2019s a massive moment in his tournament. But no such troubles for Tommy Fleetwood. Back at 15, the shaggy-haired one curls in a 25-footer for birdie and he hits the giddy heights of 7-under and just one off JB Holmes\u2019 lead. Tiger is looking much more comfortable today, the troublesome back warmed by the rather pleasant temperatures. It\u2019s not exactly sunbathing weather but Woods cuts a happier figure this morning. Of course, it helps if the putter heats up too and, after draining a big one at the opening hole, he sinks a 20-footer at 6 to go -2 for the day. At +5 overall, he still looks maybe two or three shots away from the cut line but he\u2019s not giving this up easily. As if we would expect anything less from the 15-time major champ. Koepka knocks in his straightforward birdie putt at 13 to get to -5 and back to tied third. Meanwhile, his rival for \u2018coolest in show\u2019 category, Dustin Johnson, knocks in a ten-footer for birdie at 6. DJ\u2019s card, like his walk, has a pleasing rhythm this morning: par-birdie-par-birdie-par-birdie. That\u2019s lifted him to -2 and tied for 17th. Jordan Spieth is 4-under for his round and 5-under overall but we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by his move today. A check of the PGA Tour\u2019s scoring averages reveals why as it shows that the Dallas native does his best work of a Friday. Spieth ranks 16th in R1 scoring, 2nd in R2, 166th in R3 and 196th in R4. In other words, a typical Spieth performance this season involves a good start, a Friday surge and a gradual slide down the leaderboard on the weekend. He\u2019ll need to reverse that final 36-hole trend to stay in the mix here but you suspect Spieth has something up his sleeve in majors. He\u2019s won three and keeps likening Royal Portrush to Royal Birkdale, the scene of his Open triumph two years ago. The accelerator has been pressed; here comes another birdie for Koepka. Buoyed by his par breaker at 12, he strikes a gorgeous tee shot to just outside four feet at the par-3 13th. That\u2019s the mark of a champion; just when it all looks a bit flat, they produce a sudden change of pace to get on the shoulder of the leader again. Back at 14, Hatton\u2019s loose approach to the right leaves him a tough up and down from a little hollow and the up bit isn\u2019t quite good enough and the putt doesn\u2019t go down. The bogey drops him back to -5 and three behind. A frustrated slap of his club as Koepka chips to 12 but the ball rolls and rolls and only decides to stop when it\u2019s waved goodbye to the hole some 15 feet behind it. And yet, the four-time major winner has plenty of ways to skin a cat and decides to knock in the putt to make his birdie that way. Koepka -4. Tommy Fleetwood now has back-to-back red numbers after another birdie putt drops at 13. He celebrates with a lovely drive at 14 and is now just two behind leader Holmes. While the par-5 12th should be a routine birdie in this weather, Brooks Koepka has word to do for his four. His approach is tugged left and into rough short of the green. The major monster is only evens for the day and that\u2019s a surprise with others gathering birdies at a regular rate elsewhere on a kinder Royal Portrush today. No concerns yet for Koepka but he\u2019ll want to go through the gears at some point and he\u2019s running out of time this morning with the harder holes (14 to 18) to come. Tommy Fleetwood moves into joint-third after what is now an expected birdie at the par-5 12th. That\u2019s three back from Holmes. As Scott mentioned, England has had just two Open champions in the last 50 years \u2013 Tony Jacklin in 1969 and Nick Faldo (1987, 1990, 1992). So what sweet music it would be if Hatton or Fleetwood lifted the claret jug. Talking of which, while I can imagine Sir Nick being quite a card at a Karaoke night, Jacklin once released his own album of pop standards (\u2018Swings Into\u2019). I actually have this record (check Discogs for yours), and will argue with anyone that Tone\u2019s version of Both Sides Now is up there with Joni Mitchell\u2019s. Tommy\u2019s quite theatrical; I reckon he could croon out some ditties. Tyrrell perhaps more thrashy punk. Hello from Royal Portrush. This is Dave Tindall. Taps mic. Whistly feedback. Awkward silence. So, I didn\u2019t expect JB Holmes to be five clear of Brooks Koepka when Scott departed stage left for a well-deserved break. Still, there it is and Holmes\u2019 nearest challenger is now Tyrrell Hatton after the Englishman birdies 12 and just misses another good chance at 13. One story which popped up in a far corner of the media centre this morning involved one of JB\u2019s practice rounds. Despite being regarded as one of the slowest players on the planet \u2013 and arguably other planets presuming they have golf courses and support life \u2013 Holmes was in a rush, twice ignoring marshal\u2019s red flags and blasting tee-shots away regardless. The reason? He didn\u2019t want to be late for a restaurant booking. There\u2019s your cure for slow play then; tell the tour\u2019s worst plodders they have a table booked five hours on from their tee-time (I\u2019ve worked in 45 minutes for freshening up and travel). A meltdown for Jon Rahm at the par-five 2nd. He\u2019s down a swale to the left of the green. He putts up. The ball comes back at his feet. He tries again with a wedge. That one comes back too. A third go flies past the flag and off the front of the green. He runs up a double bogey seven, and clatters down to -1. He\u2019s bubbling. Meanwhile a different sort of emotional scene on 18 as Tom Lehman says goodbye to the Open. No valedictory birdie, his putt shaving the lip, but it\u2019s a par and he\u2019s off into the sunset having shot 78-76 this week. He\u2019s +12, but he\u2019ll always have Lytham. The crowd salute him with the warmth he deserves, and he doffs his cap in thanks. A lovely moment. And with that, I\u2019m away for a bit. David Tindall will be your guide for the next hour. Enjoy, enjoy! Another birdie for JB Holmes! This one comes at the par-three 6th, reward for a fine tee shot to 12 feet. A straight putt in, and suddenly he\u2019s sitting on a three-shot lead, because Spieth\u2019s approach to 9 finds a bunker from which he can\u2019t get up and down. Bogey. He\u2019s still turning in 32 strokes, though. And Cameron Smith of Australia, who has top-five finishes at the Masters and the US Open, but has done nix at the Open so far, birdies 2, 7 and 8 to get himself involved. \u201cSo glad you mentioned Laura Davies,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cYes, she is quite wonderful, isn\u2019t she? My favourite bit of byplay was when Sky\u2019s Ewen Murray asked her if she liked Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s all-the-fashion golf shirt. \u2018No, I don\u2019t like it. You could wear it though.\u2019 I love that! It\u2019s the equivalent of sitting in a restaurant and one\u2019s companion saying \u2018This tastes awful! Here, try some.\u2019 Splendid.\u201d -8: Holmes (6) -5: Hatton (11), Spieth (9) -4: Van Rooyen (14), Fleetwood (11), Smith (8), Lowry Adam Hadwin, from the middle of the 8th fairway, sends a one-bounce iron into the cup! The Canadian is going along very nicely today as a result, his eagle following birdies at 2 and 7, He\u2019s -1. Kurt Kitayama, a 26-year-old Californian playing in the Open for the first time, and with two wins already this year on the European Tour, is on a hell of a tear today as well. Birdies at 3, 4, 7, 8 and now 12, with a sole bogey at 10, and he\u2019s whistled 65 places up the leaderboard to -1. Meanwhile a rare backwards step by An Byeong-hun, who had birdied 2, 4, 7, 12 and 15, but finally sheds a stroke at 16. He\u2019s -2. An astonishing par save by Tyrrell Hatton on 11! Having flayed his drive into triffids down the right of the fairway, he just about managed to hack his ball back onto the semi-rough. You could only just see his head poking out of the verdant wilds. His third into the green wasn\u2019t all that, either, his ball rolling off the back. But he guides in a 35-footer to remain at -5! But he\u2019s two off the top now, because up on 5, Holmes birdies to re-establish sole ownership of the lead. -7: Holmes (5) -6: Spieth (8) -5: Hatton (11) -4: Van Rooyen (13), Fleetwood (10), Lowry Jordan Spieth is responsible for one of the iconic Open moments: that odyssey down 13 at Birkdale a couple of years ago. The sheer lunacy of his sortie to the practice range tends to obscure the brilliance of what came after he limited the damage to bogey. Birdie, eagle, birdie, birdie. Title sealed. Well, he\u2019s doing something very similar today. A 25-foot rake across 8, and it\u2019s another birdie! He\u2019s five under for the last four holes, after going birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie. He\u2019s grabbed himself a share of the lead. You have got to love this guy. -6: Spieth (8), Holmes (4) -5: Hatton (10) -4: Van Rooyen (13), Fleetwood (10), Lowry Sky Sports have got a new commentator in their ranks this week: the four-time major winner Laura Davies. She\u2019s a great listen. Witty, easy-going and informative, she\u2019s always on hand to immediately explain the lay of the land and the many shot options available to the players, something not always apparent watching links golf in 2D. Expertise, experience and knowledge lightly worn. She\u2019s also had a righteous pop at folk who moan about the coverage given over to Tiger - \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want to watch him?!\u201d - and as an aside written off VAR in football as the pointless fiasco it is. Marvellous. Never mind par for Tiger! He curls in a big left-to-right breaker from 25 feet, and that\u2019s an opening birdie that brings him back to +6. Here comes hope! A broad smile as he considers the prospect of one of the great cut-dodging rounds. Buckle in, folks! Then up on 7, Jordan Spieth rolls in a putt from the swale to the right of the green, and that\u2019s an eagle that catapults him into a share of second! Fleetwood saves his par on 9, three scrambles on the bounce! And to complete a manic minute, Justin Rose birdies 2. It\u2019s all happening! Again! -6: Holmes (4) -5: Hatton (9), Spieth (7) -4: Van Rooyen (11), Fleetwood (9), Lowry -3: Koepka (8), Westwood (3), Rose (2), Rahm, Noren, Simpson, Garcia, Frittelli, MacIntyre, Aphibarnrat Tiger\u2019s got a good lie in the rough down 1, and finds the green with his second. Two putts, and he should escape with par. Fleetwood is once again scrambling for par, having driven wildly down 9. Forced to chip back out, he wedges to eight feet from 100 yards. A chance to save himself yet again. Meanwhile Oosthuizen misses another tiddler, this time at 8, this time at the cost of a shot. He slips to -2. Tiger time! Having shot 78 yesterday, weekend participation is pretty much a pipe dream, the way he\u2019s been playing since that spine-tingling victory at Augusta. And yet there\u2019s electricity in the gallery regardless as he takes to the tee. Star quality. You either have it or you don\u2019t. However the early signs aren\u2019t good, as he pulls another stiff one into the thick stuff down the left. Patrick Reed meanwhile unsheathes a wood and larrups his opening drive down the middle. A street-fighting level-par 71 yesterday for the 2018 Masters champion, who gets a raw PR deal in the HBH\u2019s book, and accordingly very much has our support. It\u2019d be great to see him in the mix come Sunday, after a quiet time since his breakthrough major victory. After two pars that feel like bogeys, here\u2019s a par that has the warm, fuzzy sensation of birdie. Fleetwood sinks a 30-foot right-to-left slider on 8. Always out of position, that could be a momentum changer in the wake of his struggle down 7. Two par scrambles in a row, and he remains at -4. Tony Finau meanwhile yips from short distance at the opening hole, and he starts with a miserable bogey. Back to -2 for the big man. Hatton is one turn away from birdie on 8, after knocking his second to 15 feet. The putt not quite the quality of the approach. Back on 7, Koepka elects to chip. And he doesn\u2019t really commit to it, his ball stopping six feet short. He tugs his birdie putt left. What a waste of two fine shots. A par that\u2019ll feel like a bogey. Ditto Oosthuizen, who yips a birdie tiddler. Holmes isn\u2019t far from making his eagle putt at 2, but birdie will do to regain sole ownership of the lead. And it\u2019s back-to-back birdies for Spieth at 6. He\u2019s in the mood for this, suddenly in the mix. -6: Holmes (2) -5: Hatton (8) -4: Van Rooyen (9), Fleetwood (7), Lowry -3: Koepka (7), Oosthuizen (7), Spieth (6), Westwood (1), Finau, Rahm, Noren, Simpson, Garcia, Frittelli, MacIntyre, Aphibarnrat Like Oosthuizen before him, Spieth follows birdie at 5 with a forensic tee shot at 6. He\u2019ll have a very good look at birdie from eight feet. Up on 7, Koepka sends his ball just over the back of the green with two huge hits. He\u2019ll be thinking about bumping up a chip, or possibly putting, from the swale. An outside eagle chance. Up and down for birdie. Meanwhile back on 2, the co-leader Holmes is pin high in two. A 25-foot eagle putt coming up. A first birdie of the day for Jordan Spieth, at 5, and he\u2019s quietly moving back in the right direction after a mid-round wobble yesterday. The 2017 winner is -2. Tommy Fleetwood escapes with his par on 7. Erik van Rooyen is inches away from draining a long birdie putt at 9, but he\u2019ll be content enough to turn in 33. Yet another birdie for An Byeong-hun, his fourth of the day, at 12; he\u2019s -2 and increasingly a factor in this tournament. And Lee Westwood\u2019s birdie effort on 1 is miserable, always turning off to the right. A chance for the fastest of starts spurned. Lee Westwood must be thoroughly fed up with his eternal bridesmaid status. With a view to addressing this misery, he sends his approach at the opening hole pin high to ten feet. That\u2019s a lovely shot. Birdie putt coming up that may inform the rest of his round. Meanwhile on 7, Fleetwood is halfway up a steep hill, his feet miles below a snagged ball. Two bunkers in between him and the green. He does extremely well to clip his ball into the swale to the right of the green; a chance to get up and down for par from there. A no-sweat par for Holmes at the opening hole. He\u2019s now sharing his lead with Hatton, of course; the Englishman can only par the 7th. They\u2019re both -5. Coming behind, Fleetwood would take that par right now, as he lashes a long iron into the bonny heather well to the right of the green. Halfway up a big slope, he\u2019ll have a puzzle to solve getting back down. Back-to-back birdies for Oosthuizen! He follows up his easy-going birdie at the short par-four 5th by swishing an effortless iron towards the flag at the par-three 6th. He\u2019s eight feet away, and in goes the putt. He joins his partner Koepka at -3, the current PGA champion unable to covert a decent opportunity from 12 feet. Par. Here comes the overnight leader JB Holmes! Easy to forget that, were it not for the freakish, other-worldly, once-in-a-generation antics of Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson at Troon in 2016, Holmes would already be an Open champion. He was the best of the rest that week, a mere 14 shots shy of Stenson, 11 behind Lefty. OK, OK, but you get the point. A wonderful 66 yesterday, and he opens his second round by splitting the fairway. Koepka is really trying it on at 5. If he creams his drive, he\u2019s surely bumping through the green and out of bounds, with the white stakes only a couple of feet behind. So he creams his drive ... and is fortunate that he\u2019s a tad off line, so his ball snags in rough at the front right of the green. Then he chips aggressively, unable to get any spin from the curly kale. His ball is only a few joules of energy shy of rolling through the green and OB. Like Frank Costanza, it stops short. He should escape with par with a couple of putts from the fringe. Yep, four. Lucky Brooks. He\u2019s -3. Birdie meanwhile for Oosthuizen, who drove the green and took a couple of wise putts. Much more sensible. He\u2019s -2. A shame for Van Rooyen, who sets his six-foot eagle putt off to the left, and it\u2019s never turning back. A misread. But it\u2019s his third birdie today. Such a shame, though, because the long iron in was so sweet. Still, he\u2019s just one off the lead now ... a lead shared by Hatton, who makes his birdie at 6 without fuss or drama. And it\u2019s all happening at the top, because Fleetwood gets up and down from the side of the risk-reward short par-four 5th (it\u2019s driveable, but there\u2019s OB just over the back) and makes birdie. Look at how this is hotting up, and it\u2019s only just gone 9am on the Friday! -5: Hatton (6), Holmes -4: Van Rooyen (7), Fleetwood (5), Lowry -3: Koepka (4), Westwood, Finau, Rahm, Noren, Simpson, Garcia, Frittelli, MacIntyre, Aphibarnrat There could be some more movement atop the leaderboard soon. Hatton has just caressed a gorgeous iron at the par-three 6th to six feet. Meanwhile up on the par-five 7th, Van Rooyen nearly pipes an iron into the cup from the fairway for an albatross! The ball bounds a few feet past the hole, so eagle\u2019s not a gimme. But he should be making birdie at the very least from there. For the record, it would have been the first albatross at the Open since Paul Lawrie lashed one in from distance at the 7th hole at Turnberry in 2009. Koepka goes backwards for only the second time this week. He\u2019s very fortunate with his tee shot on 4, the ball sticking on the shoulder of a bunker and refusing to topple back in. However he comes up short with his second and, shortsided, does well to chip to 15 feet. But he can\u2019t make the putt. He\u2019s back to -3, his place at -4 taken by Tyrrell Hatton, who birdies 5 to move within a shot. -5: Holmes -4: Hatton (5), Lowry -3: Van Rooyen (6), Fleetwood (4), Koepka (4), Westwood, Finau, Rahm, Noren, Simpson, Garcia, Frittelli, MacIntyre, Aphibarnrat -2: Fox (6), Rose, Park, Turner, Langasque A second bogey of the day for Justin Thomas, who misses a short one on 4. He throws his putter away in frustration. He\u2019s +2. Much more of this, and he\u2019ll have to start fretting about the cut. A long way to go, of course, but early guesswork, nothing more, suggests it might fall around +3 or +4. Meanwhile Ryan Fox arrests his early morning slide with birdie at 5. He\u2019s -2. Koepka sends his tee shot at 3 into the swale to the left of the green. No matter: he just gracefully scoops his wedge to a couple of feet, and tidies up for par. For a player with a boom-boom reputation, he\u2019s got such a delicate touch around the greens. He\u2019s the complete player. Meanwhile a second birdie of the day for the increasingly impressive Erik van Rooyen; the 29-year-old South African has been hanging around the leaderboards at the majors for much of the last year. A breakthrough could be a-coming, because he moves to -3, sinking a 15-foot putt at 5 after leaving an eagle attempt egregiously short. Two men with ice in the veins. While Koepka was making his birdie at 2, Sharma was doing the same, repairing the damage of the opening hole. He\u2019s back to -1. Oosthuizen was busy making a disappointing three-putt par. He stays at -1. A fast start meanwhile for Thomas Pieters, who birdies 2 and 4 to move to -1. The big Belgian has top-ten finishes at the Masters and the PGA under his belt, but he\u2019s done little at the Open. Time to make good, perhaps. An Byeong-hun hasn\u2019t really done anything in the majors to date. But the 27-year-old from Seoul finished the recent US Open tied for 16th, his best effort yet. And he could be in the mood to trump that this week. He\u2019s followed up his early birdie at 2 with others at 4 and 7. He\u2019s whistled 52 places up the leaderboard to -1. Meanwhile on 2, Koepka nearly drains his eagle putt, but taps in for birdie. The first positive move at the toppermost of the poppermost: -5: Holmes -4: Koepka (2), Lowry -3: Hatton (4), Fleetwood (3), Westwood, Finau, Rahm, Noren, Simpson, Garcia, Frittelli, MacIntyre, Aphibarnrat -2: Van Rooyen (4), Rose, Park, Turner, Langasque Bounce-back birdie for Tommy Fleetwood at 2. All down to a lovely second into the meat of the green. His eagle putt wasn\u2019t too far away. Coming behind, Brooks Koepka sends his second at the par-five pin high. He\u2019ll have a relatively straight look at eagle from 25 feet or so. Golf is such a wonderfully weird game. Ryan Fox couldn\u2019t stop making birdies yesterday afternoon; now, not much more than 14 hours later, the new record holder for the low back nine at the Open can\u2019t stop making bogeys He follows up his mistake at 1 with a short yip at 3, and he\u2019s down to -1 already. Another par for Hatton at 2. Greenside in two, his chip on doesn\u2019t spin back to set up a makeable birdie putt. Still, he remains at -3. Back on 1, Koepka powers his second from the thick stuff into the heart of the green, then lips out from 25 feet. So close to a sensational turnaround in fortune after that poor tee shot. But he\u2019ll have taken his par. Oosthuizen pars as well. But it\u2019s a first bogey of the week for Shubhankar Sharma, who makes up this group, the result of a wayward tee shot. He was only half a turn away from salvaging his par, too. A breakthrough statement can\u2019t be long in coming for the 22-year-old from India. A high finish this week could be it. Fleetwood\u2019s first putt, from the fringe to the side of 1, is woefully underhit. He leaves himself a 30-foot hope for par, and the putt\u2019s never going in. He slips back to -2. And his partner Thomas can\u2019t get up and down from the sand, so he\u2019s going the wrong way as well; he\u2019s +1. But up on 2, Erik van Rooyen rattles one in from distance, and the early birdie takes up up to -2. The 29-year-old South African is beginning to make his name in the majors, after good showings in last year\u2019s Open, and this year\u2019s US Open and PGA. Someone to keep an eye on this week. Here comes the world number one, Brooks Koepka! The gallery gives him the ovation he deserves. But his opening tee shot isn\u2019t up to standard. Like Fleetwood before him, he toys with the OB stakes down the left, and is pleased to see his ball nestle in the thick rough and refuse point blank to bounce towards serious scorecard-related bother. Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 champion, is a bit braver than most: instead of playing it safe with iron, he takes a fairway wood. And claps it down the middle. There are only three players under 30 with a major to their name. Justin Thomas is one. (Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka are the others.) The 2017 PGA champ has a reasonable lie down the right of 1. But he undercooks his second, the ball stopping short of the green and turning off into a bunker to the left. A tricky up and down to come. Tommy Fleetwood makes a much better fist of his second from the left, powering his ball pin high, just off the side of the green to the right. He\u2019ll have taken that for sure when he was anxiously watching his tee shot sail towards the out-of-bounds markers. Now all he needs to do is get up and down. No biggie. A huge reception for Tommy Fleetwood as he tees it up. But the crowd fall quiet as his ball whistles towards the OB down the left. Fortunately it snags in the thick rough just before the white posts. Lucky Tommy. Justin Thomas, who salvaged his round yesterday after a slow start, ending up with a level-par 71, finds the cabbage down the right. Up on the green, Tyrrell Hatton leaves his birdie effort well short, but salvages the situation with a hard-as-nails par saver from 12 feet. That\u2019ll give him heart. A dropped shot on 1 after bogey at 18 yesterday might have sent a notoriously emotional player off into a tailspin. But he looks pretty happy with that. All hot streaks must come to an end. Ryan Fox birdied six of his last seven holes last night, but he\u2019s bogeyed his first today. On in regulation, he trundled a hot birdie effort miles past the cup, and couldn\u2019t save himself coming back. He slips to -2, then sends his drive at the par-five 2nd into sand on the left, so his chances of bouncing back with a birdie on one of Portrush\u2019s more forgiving holes are immediately diminished. Tyrrell Hatton would be one off the lead were it not for a closing-hole bogey yesterday evening. Heart on sleeve as ever, he looked thoroughly deflated after finishing with his only dropped shot of the day. But you can\u2019t knock an opening round of 68 at the Open. A good round this morning, when the weather\u2019s kind, and he\u2019ll be set fair for the weekend. England hasn\u2019t had an Open champion since Nick Faldo won at Muirfield in 1992. Pre-Faldo, the English are looking at Tony Jacklin in 1969. Before that, it\u2019s Max Faulkner, the 1951 winner at ... Royal Portrush. Some sort of sign? OK, it\u2019s a stretch. But it\u2019s got to happen sometime. He knocks his tee shot down the middle, then sends his second pin high, albeit just off the putting surface to the right. Ryan Fox hasn\u2019t got much of a track record in the majors. The 32-year-old from Auckland\u2019s best showing in one of the big ones is a tie for 27th in last year\u2019s PGA at Bellerive. But he\u2019s now got a record in the majors: yesterday afternoon he birdied 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18, a blitz that saw him come back in 29 strokes, a new Open best. The previous record of 30 was set by Eric Brown at Lytham in 1958, and was since matched by Tommy Nakajima (1986 Troon), Ross Drummond (Muirfield 1987), Mark Brooks (Turnberry 1994), Phil Mickelson (St Andrews 2000), Stuart Appelby (Muirfield 2002), Kenichi Kuboya (Turnberry 2009), Rory McIlroy (St Andrews 2010) and Justin Rose (last year at Carnoustie). But you can strike through all of that now. Fox receives a warm ovation as he tees it up this morning, then cracks his iron down the track. He\u2019s -3, the first of the leading pack out today. The first birdies of the second round, and they both go to South Koreans. An Byeong-hun, coming off the back of a decent showing at Pebble Beach in the US Open, moves to +1 after picking up a shot at 2. Meanwhile Innchoon Hwang, playing in the Open for the first time at 44, birdies the opening hole, reward for a delightful second arrowed straight at the flag. He\u2019s level par now. Rory\u2019s not long for this championship either. Here\u2019s Andy Bull\u2019s take on his head-spinning horror show yesterday. You\u2019ll need some reading matter to go with that breakfast cuppa. Here\u2019s Tiger on his sore back. Get him while you can, because he won\u2019t be here this weekend. It\u2019s sunny and relatively still this morning at Portrush. But don\u2019t expect it to stay that way forever. It\u2019ll begin to cloud over soon enough. The morning is expected to stay dry, the odd squall excepted, but the chances of showers increase in the afternoon. We should avoid heavy rain, but don\u2019t bet the farm on it, this is links golf, this is the Open Championship. The wind should be gentle all day, though the aforementioned don\u2019t-risk-the-mortgage caveat remains. Lehman\u2019s errant drive leads to a bogey. Not the ideal start to the champ\u2019s valedictory round. He slips to +8. Niemann\u2019s salvage bid looks doomed as he too drops a shot; he\u2019s +6. Jimenez is the only one of the three to make par, but he remains at +11. It\u2019ll be a wee while before things hot up this morning. Plenty of time to make yourself a cup of coffee. The 1996 Champion Golfer gets the second day\u2019s play underway. Tom Lehman, at 60 exempt for the final time, is most likely playing his last round at the Open today, having shot 78 yesterday. He sends his opening tee shot into a fairway bunker to the right. He\u2019ll be going round with the current Senior Open champion Miguel Angel Jimenez, who ran up an 82 yesterday and is just biding time until he defends his title next week. The 20-year-old Chilean prospect Joaquin Niemann makes up the three-ball. He\u2019s got plenty of work to do today if he\u2019s to extend his Open debut into the weekend, having shot 76 yesterday. Yesterday, JB Holmes shot 66, Tiger carded 78, Rory McIlroy took 79, Ryan Fox came back in 29, Emiliano Grillo aced 13, and David Duval ran up 14 on 7. If today has half as many jaw-dropping moments, we\u2019ll be doing pretty well. Here\u2019s how the top of the leaderboard looks after the first round ... -5: Holmes -4: Lowry -3: Noren, Simpson, Garcia, Frittelli, MacIntyre, Aphibarnrat, Fox, Hatton, Fleetwood, Koepka, Westwood, Finau, Rahm -2: Langasque, Rose, Park, Turner ... and here are today\u2019s tee times.

      "bodyText": "Argentina\u2019s supreme court has been asked to recognize the legal rights of the South American jaguar, of which fewer than 20 individuals remain alive in the country\u2019s Gran Chaco region. The largest cat in the Americas once roamed the continent as far north as the Grand Canyon, but is now in decline across the entire western hemisphere. In Argentina, the speckled feline has been driven to the brink of extinction by the destruction of habitat to make way for soy plantations and cattle ranches. Argentina\u2019s National Parks Administration estimates that fewer than 250 are left alive in the country, and only 20 in the Gran Chaco region, a forest that has lost some 12m hectares (an area larger than Denmark) in the last 35 years. On Friday, lawyers representing Greenpeace Argentina argued in the supreme court that the country should recognize the rights of the entire species. \u201cIf the legal rights of inanimate corporations are recognized, why not the legal rights of a species of nature, which is very much alive,\u201d said the group\u2019s lawyer Enrique Viale. A strong legal precedent was set in Argentina in 2016 when Argentina\u2019s courts recognized a 29-year-old Sumatran orangutan held at the Buenos Aires zoo, named Sandra, as a \u201cnon-human person\u201d. Greenpeace Argentina is now seeking a similar status for the remaining jaguars in the Gran Chaco. \u201cWe now want recognition of the rights of the entire species,\u201d Viale told the Guardian. The case is being brought against four provinces of northern Argentina \u2013 Salta, Chaco, Santiago del Estero and Formosa \u2013 where deforestation has been rampant since the introduction of genetically modified soy two decades ago. Argentina\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on soybeans, which make up 31% of the country\u2019s exports. Despite a forestry law that divides Argentina\u2019s forests into \u201cred\u201d (non-deforestable), \u201cyellow\u201d (mixed use) and \u201cgreen\u201d (deforestable) areas, provincial officials encourage soy production and livestock farming by illegally handing out permits to large landowners transforming \u201cred\u201d areas to \u201cgreen\u201d. The Greenpeace lawsuit demands \u201czero deforestation\u201d in Argentina\u2019s portion of the Gran Chaco which also extends into neighbouring Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil. One recent study estimates that habitat loss will cause the extinction of 50% of birds and 30% of mammals in the Gran Chaco within 10-25 years. \u201cNature\u2019s species also have rights and the recognition of these rights is a step forward for humanity,\u201d said the Greenpeace Argentina director, Natalia Machain.",

However, there has been an outcry from some in the party, including Tom Watson, the deputy leader, whose relations with the leadership are at a low point. More than 60 Labour peers took out an advertisement accusing Corbyn of having \u201cfailed the test of leadership\u201d over his handling of antisemitism complaints within the party, and Labour\u2019s leaders in the House of Lords issued a veiled challenge to Corbyn\u2019s authority on Monday by warning him that antisemitism was a \u201ccancer that will continue to grow\u201d. Meanwhile, more than 200 Labour supporters \u2013 half of them current or former Labour staffers \u2013 demanded an explanation from party bosses over the treatment of the Panorama whistleblowers.

      "bodyText": "For this performance in a secret location, the audience are escorted through Manchester city centre to a desolate post-industrial space scattered with barbed wire and cracked concrete. Mobile phones are locked in pouches before entering an old warehouse building to experience a dystopian vision from grime pioneer Skepta, working in collaboration with Foxfinder playwright Dawn King, design studio TEM and \u201cimmersive performance director\u201d Matthew Dunster for this Manchester international festival show. Dystopia987 is pitched as \u201ca waking dream that presents Skepta\u2019s singular vision of the future: deep, dark, radical and riveting\u201d. Once inside the multiroom cavernous space, the walls read \u201cfree energy\u201d, \u201cfree your mind\u201d, \u201cfree your ego\u201d; headphones give audio instructions to \u201cconnect and let go\u201d, asking: \u201cWhen was the last time you made eye contact with a stranger?\u201d It\u2019s not very different from a typical nightclub experience.

The idea that a country should undergo the trauma of a chaotic Brexit in order to be relieved of footling regulatory obstacles that exist mostly in the imagination would be laughable were it not so frighteningly close to happening. The same might well be said of Mr Johnson entering Downing Street.",

There were 15 of us lifting the car up to get a person out.</p> <p>\u201cWe are car enthusiasts, not boy racers. Families come down to the events with young children. We want people to show off their pride and enjoy. If you want to race, spend money on going to a track event.\u201d</p> <p>Hundreds of spectators had gathered for the showcase. Local people say the regular gatherings had taken place in other parts of the town previously and Stevenage is a popular location for car aficionados due to its numerous long straight roads from the Roman period which have been converted into dual carriageways.</p> <p>Lorna Strutt drove past the scene of the crash 15 minutes after it happened. \u201cIt was a charity event, perhaps that\u2019s why there were more standing around,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has to have their bit of fun.

      "bodyText": "Local people and witnesses to a crash at a car meet in Stevenage that left 17 people injured have said the event was not organised or policed properly. For 17 years, drivers of modified cars have gathered in the Hertfordshire town to parade their vehicles for fellow enthusiasts. Thursday\u2019s event, which was raising money for a charity supporting bereaved parents, turned to disaster when some of the spectators watching from the side of the road were hit following the crash between a Nissan 350Z and a Toyota GT86. One of the vehicles was estimated to have been travelling at 60-70mph when it hit spectators on the single-carriageway section of an A-road. Police said two of the injured were in a serious but not critical condition in hospital. Rix Sidhu, 29, from Cruise Herts, who organised the car event, said he did not recognise the two drivers involved and they were not members of the group. He said police were aware of their regular gatherings but no officers attended Thursday\u2019s event. Sidhu said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d over the incident, adding: \u201cThe problem is we can\u2019t control the people driving. Last night, people were recklessly driving up the dual carriageway. \u201cThere were bodies lying on the road, people bleeding. There were 15 of us lifting the car up to get a person out. \u201cWe are car enthusiasts, not boy racers. Families come down to the events with young children. We want people to show off their pride and enjoy. If you want to race, spend money on going to a track event.\u201d Hundreds of spectators had gathered for the showcase. Local people say the regular gatherings had taken place in other parts of the town previously and Stevenage is a popular location for car aficionados due to its numerous long straight roads from the Roman period which have been converted into dual carriageways. Lorna Strutt drove past the scene of the crash 15 minutes after it happened. \u201cIt was a charity event, perhaps that\u2019s why there were more standing around,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has to have their bit of fun. If it is contained in a car park as usual then it\u2019s fine. But last night was bloody dangerous. \u201cThe road wasn\u2019t organised to be shut off. Usually there is police presence.\u201d Dark tyre marks shaped in figure eights remained in the car park of the retail park where the event was held. One car enthusiast, from nearby Royston, said: \u201cYou get a lot of people not part of the group then you get hassle, they are outsiders. \u201cIt\u2019s a show and meet but they watch the old films and think let\u2019s go racing. \u201cWhen I used to do it, there was a lot of racing and noise when The Fast and Furious films came out. \u201cI don\u2019t know why local councils and police don\u2019t work with the groups. Out in America and Australia they close roads and do diversions, police work with them.\u201d Another man showed the Guardian a video circulating on WhatsApp from a witness, of teenage boys being hit by one of the vehicles. He said: \u201cIt is a nuisance but there is nowhere for them to do it. They come to an industrial estate because it is closed at night.

Ch Insp Alicia Shaw said: \u201cWe weren\u2019t aware of this event taking place and we weren\u2019t aware of such large numbers attending the Stevenage area.\u201d Shaw said officers had attended events in the past and handed out warnings or seized cars when they were being driven dangerously. Hertfordshire fire and rescue service said crews had cut one person trapped in a vehicle free and provided \u201ctrauma care\u201d to a number of injured people.",

The lake is an important breeding ground for wildlife including crocodiles and manatees, a freshwater mammal suffering population declines across the region.

      "bodyText": "Guatemala\u2019s constitutional court has upheld a request from indigenous campaigners to suspend operations at one of the largest nickel mines in Central America, in a battle over the facility\u2019s environmental impact. The court found in favour of an appeal brought by campaigners who claim the ministry of energy and mines failed to carry out a full consultation with local people when it decided, in 2016, to extend the licence for the Fenix mine. Fenix, which is owned by a company headquartered in Switzerland and with large operations in Russia and Ukraine, had lain dormant for decades before being reopened in 2014. The shock court ruling comes one month after the Guardian joined a group of 35 media organisations in 30 countries to investigate Fenix as part of the Green Blood project, a series about the dangers faced by journalists reporting on the environment. It is understood that the court will shortly issue a written order demanding an immediate halt to further activity at the opencast mine and refinery. Fenix is near the town of El Estor, on the shores of Lake Izabal, Guatemala\u2019s largest expanse of fresh water. The lake is an important breeding ground for wildlife including crocodiles and manatees, a freshwater mammal suffering population declines across the region. The lake\u2019s fish are a source of food and income for local people. In the hills above Izabal, there are about 20 Mayan villages, some of which do not appear on official maps, within the 250,000 sq km area covered by the Fenix licence. Those nearest the mine have complained of water shortages and crop failures. The mine\u2019s owner, Solway Group, says it carries out impact studies before digging, that it obeys all applicable environmental laws, and that there is no scientific evidence of harm to the local environment. Responding to the ruling, the Swiss group said: \u201cSolway\u2019s operational activities are always performed in accordance with the law. We will certainly follow the constitutional court\u2019s decision. However, as an employer responsible for the lives of over 2,000 staff members and their families, we will take all possible measures not to halt our operations to the extent that this is possible within the legal framework.\u201d An appeal against a decision by the Guatemalan ministry of energy and mines to extend the Fenix licence, in 2016, was brought by members of the fishermen\u2019s union, who began protesting against the mine in 2017. The appeal was upheld in February this year. In a statement on Friday, the constitutional court said it had decided to uphold a further demand from campaigners to temporarily halt operations until the conclusion of the legal battle over consultation. Solway, based in the Swiss town of Zug, is appealing against the ruling that it should consult the community. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for 25 July. In the interim, the court said its intention was to \u201cgrant provisional relief in favour of the applicants; temporarily suspending, pending the processing of the appeal, the licence of the mining exploitation right called Fenix\u201d. Judges cited Guatemala\u2019s commitment to the 1989 Central American Commission on Environment and Development, which committed the country to the \u201crational\u201d use of natural resources, pollution control and restoration of ecological balance. The disputes between Solway and local communities began in May 2017 after the waters of Lake Izabal turned red for a period of weeks. Government studies blamed an algae bloom caused by sewage, and denied any link to the mine. But campaigners remained concerned and continued to take direct action, erecting blockades near the gates of the mine and barricading the families of workers inside a residential compound.",

Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson, who has said the party would ban gambling companies from football shirts if the party won power, said the gambling industry was undermining its own claims to be behaving responsibly. \u201cLess than a year ago, we were told by the gambling industry that they are committed to reducing the amount of advertising in football. We were told that we are facing a \u2018watershed moment\u2019 in which they would strive to provide an ever safer gambling environment. \u201cThese are their words, not mine. But it is impossible to take these words in good faith when we are actually seeing an increase in gambling advertising around matches. \u201cThe time for warm words is over. Either the industry is going to act in good faith, or we will need stricter regulation of gambling advertising \u2013 starting with a ban on football shirt sponsorship.\u201d While gambling companies are by far the most numerous among football shirt sponsors, they are not the most lucrative according to data compiled by the Sporting Intelligence website. Manchester United stand to be by far the biggest beneficiary of shirt deals thanks to the club\u2019s $80m-a-year sponsorship deal with US automotive giant Chevrolet, the value of which has risen in sterling terms due to the pound\u2019s weakness against the dollar. They are closely followed by the \u00a345m-a-year deal that near neighbours Manchester City have with Etihad, the airline owned by Abu Dhabi, the emirate whose royal family includes City owner Sheikh Mansour. But while none of the top six have a gambling sponsor, the industry accounts for the vast majority of the rest of the 14 remaining clubs\u2019 shirt deals, with Malta-based Betway the biggest contributor via its \u00a310m deal with West Ham United. \u201cGiven gambling companies have accepted the principle of not showing TV ads during football matches because they are visible to children, it is completely unjustifiable for the pre-watershed ban to not extend to shirt sponsorship and pitch perimeter advertising as well,\u201d said recovering gambling addict James Grimes. Grimes is leading The Big Step, a charity walk from Manchester City to Manchester United, via six clubs that have betting sponsors, to raise money for Gambling With Lives, a charity set up by Liz and Charles Ritchie after son Jack, 24, took his own life following a betting addiction. A study released earlier this year warned of \u201cdire consequences\u201d due to the industry\u2019s saturation of the game, while recent research has shown links between gambling and suicide. Both Ladbrokes-owner GVC and Paddy Power Betfair have broken ranks with the industry by calling for an end to shirt sponsorship deals.",

      "bodyText": "Federal prosecutors have charged a former president of a major pharmaceutical distributor with flooding parts of Appalachia with millions of opioid pills while ignoring evidence they were driving addiction and death. The arrest of Anthony Rattini, the ex-head of Miami-Luken, on criminal charges marks a significant shift in legal action to hold the drug industry to account for the US opioid epidemic as hundreds of civil actions against manufacturers and distributors head to court. Rattini is accused of distributing powerful narcotic painkillers for other than medical reasons to more than 200 pharmacies across West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Tennessee. Rattini was charged alongside Miami-Luken\u2019s former compliance officer, James Barclay, and two West Virginia pharmacists who ordered large amounts of the drugs from the company. Prosecutors accuse the Miami-Luken executives of shipping huge quantities of opioid pills to pharmacies in rural towns over several years despite warnings from the Drug Enforcement Administration. They are alleged to have deliberately ignored evidence that the opioids were not being dispensed with legitimate prescriptions . The company has previously acknowledged delivering 5.7m opioid pills between 2005 and 2011 to the small town of Kermit, West Virginia, with a population of just 380 people. In 2008 alone, it shipped 5,264 pills for every man, woman and child in Kermit.

Its former chair, Joseph Mastandrea, was alone among drug distributor executives who appeared before Congress in 2018 in conceding that his firm had played a role in the spread of an epidemic estimated to have claimed more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades. The criminal charges came days after the release of DEA data revealed that drug distributors delivered more than 75bn opioid pills across the country between 2008 and 2012. The charges will be of concern to executives of other distributors because they include accusations that the company ignored DEA warnings to report suspiciously high orders for opioid pills. Several of the country\u2019s largest distributors have paid large settlements to settle civil cases with US states and the justice department making similar accusations.",

Just as supporters of a team knocked out of the cup console themselves that \u201cNow we can concentrate on the league\u201d, so I have tried to reassure myself that a no-deal crash-out from the EU might not be such a disaster. That, you never know, it might even be a good thing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/tory-rebels-send-stark-warning-to-boris-johnson-over-no-deal-brexit\">Tory rebels send stark warning to Boris Johnson over no-deal Brexit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Such a strategy remains necessary because no deal still waits for us on the other side of summer. It is, as the Brexiter ultras delight in pointing out, the legal default. It remains the law of the land unless and until MPs vote for something else. True, on Thursday, MPs placed an obstacle in the path of the likely next prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/tory-rebels-send-stark-warning-to-boris-johnson-over-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">preventing Boris Johnson</a> from simply suspending parliament \u2013 which would have been a dictator\u2019s move as well as a dick move \u2013 by requiring the Commons to sit through October. But that only makes no deal harder; it does not make it impossible. All it will take is MPs who were once staunch in their opposition to leaving the EU without a deal to fold. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/amber-rudd-drops-opposition-to-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd</a> has done it. This week Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/id-take-no-deal-over-no-brexit-says-labours-sarah-champion\" title=\"\">Sarah Champion</a> did it. More could follow. For that reason, remainers need to gird ourselves for Halloween, to have a comfort blanket in the drawer, ready to cling to if the worst happens. Which is why I\u2019ve been busy knitting these past few weeks, coming up with the arguments that might help us self-soothe. Here goes.</p> \n<p>Perhaps no deal is what it will take to cure the country of its Brexit fever. Maybe nothing less than a complete severance of all ties is the only way to snap ourselves out of this delirium. Until now, for example, the Brexiters have been able to cast every hitch and disappointment as the handiwork of wicked remainers bent on thwarting Britain\u2019s destiny. If there\u2019s been no stampede of unicorns towards the sunlit uplands, that\u2019s because the faint-hearts and fifth columnists connived with Brussels to deny the British people their will. A no-deal exit would end that betrayal myth once and for all. Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the others would have got everything they wanted. They would be unable to cry treachery, because we would have left the EU the way they demanded we leave. They\u2019d be unable to blame remainers or the judges or the BBC or the universities, because no one would have stood in their way. It will be their Brexit and they will have to own it.</p> \n<p>Next, the Brexiters have dismissed every warning as Project Fear, including Thursday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/18/no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-britain-into-a-recession-says-obr\" title=\"\">estimate</a> from the Office for Budget Responsibility that no deal will kick a \u00a330bn dent in the public finances, a projection that the OBR\u2019s head explained was calculated on \u201crelatively benign\u201d figures and was avowedly \u201cnot at the most pessimistic end of the spectrum\u201d. So perhaps the only way the Brexiters will ever be convinced is when they see and feel the consequences of no deal not as rhetoric from their political adversaries but as cold, hard reality \u2013 when they, or their constituents, see the lorries backed up for miles at Dover, the supermarket shelves empty of food, the medical supplies running out.</p> \n<p>Above all, perhaps it will take the pain and chaos of a crash-out from the EU finally to lay to rest the imperial delusion that has long underpinned the Brexit cause. For decades, the conventional wisdom held that it took the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\" title=\"\">humiliation of Suez</a> to wake the British governing class from its dreams of empire and to realise Britain\u2019s true, more modest place in the world. But the Brexit process has surely revealed the opposite: that those fantasies endured long after 1956; that the notion of Britain as a global superpower, held back and denied glory by pettifogging continentals, refused to die. Perhaps, then, it will take the blow to national pride inflicted by a disastrous exit from the EU to force Britain\u2019s rulers to see the country as it actually is: no longer a global superpower, but instead a proud, successful nation whose strength depends not on breaking from its nearest neighbours but, in part, on its close ties to them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3e52323c-35ba-4e30-8abb-02ad2abc7a48\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gun2wB_M37U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>These are the patches I\u2019ve been stitching into a quilt ready to clutch the day Johnson and his enablers lead us to catastrophe. Like anyone who\u2019s ever lost something precious, I\u2019d find a way to tell myself it was for the best.</p> \n<p>But, sad to say, it won\u2019t work. I look upon this blanket of comfort and find it thin and threadbare. For one thing, how plausible is it to imagine that, even if Brexit is the total rupture Farage yearns for, he won\u2019t still insist that the people were betrayed and that this Brexit was insufficiently pure? The betrayal myth will not be dispelled by anything so weak as mere facts.</p> \n<p>Nor can we rely on the realisation of all those forecasts dismissed as Project Fear to shake Brexiters\u2019 faith. Even if there are no tomatoes in Asda and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/18/stockpiling-insulin-for-no-deal-brexit-if-i-run-out-i-have-no-idea-what-to-do\" title=\"\">no insulin</a> in the hospitals, Rees-Mogg won\u2019t blame himself or his fellow fanatics: he\u2019ll blame the government (or Theresa May, if Johnson gives him a job) for failing to prepare properly.</p> \n<p>And if, more likely, dawn breaks on 1 November and the sky has not fallen in, the Brexiters will claim victory. \u201cSee!\u201d they\u2019ll chirrup. \u201cAll those doom-mongers were wrong. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d Because it\u2019s possible that no deal won\u2019t trigger an instant calamity, but rather act as a slow puncture for the economy, tipping us into recession, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/1151801172732329984?s=20\" title=\"\">steadily destroying 200,000 jobs</a> and shrinking wages. Expectations of a no-deal exit are so low, if Britons are not living in the streets wearing animal skins and foraging for weevils by Christmas, the Brexiters will declare it a triumph.</p> \n<p>And even if it is an immediate disaster, visible on day one, there are few guarantees that leavers would admit their error and seek once more the embrace of Brussels. As Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform puts it, \u201cJust because babies are dying, does that mean they\u2019ll say we were better off in the EU?\u201d Aren\u2019t they just as likely to blame the beastly Europeans for inflicting such a hellscape on an innocent nation? After all, even Boris Johnson once thought Britain could leave the EU and <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/08/15/boris-johnson-ham-of-fate/\" title=\"\">keep</a> its seat on the European council of ministers. The Brexiters will cry, \u201cHow we were to know that leaving the EU meant leaving the EU?\u201d And if they don\u2019t blame Brussels, they\u2019ll blame someone else: foreigners, minorities, anyone but themselves.</p> \n<p>Most important, even if a no-deal Brexit delivered sweet vindication for remainers, it would taste bitter. No deal remains an appalling prospect; to flirt with it is, as Grant observes, \u201cplaying with people\u2019s lives and livelihoods\u201d. We cannot wish disaster on the country solely to exorcise our demons. Instead we have to keep fighting it with all our might \u2013 knowing there will be no comfort blanket to soothe us.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Just as supporters of a team knocked out of the cup console themselves that \u201cNow we can concentrate on the league\u201d, so I have tried to reassure myself that a no-deal crash-out from the EU might not be such a disaster. That, you never know, it might even be a good thing. Such a strategy remains necessary because no deal still waits for us on the other side of summer. It is, as the Brexiter ultras delight in pointing out, the legal default. It remains the law of the land unless and until MPs vote for something else. True, on Thursday, MPs placed an obstacle in the path of the likely next prime minister, preventing Boris Johnson from simply suspending parliament \u2013 which would have been a dictator\u2019s move as well as a dick move \u2013 by requiring the Commons to sit through October. But that only makes no deal harder; it does not make it impossible. All it will take is MPs who were once staunch in their opposition to leaving the EU without a deal to fold. Amber Rudd has done it. This week Labour\u2019s Sarah Champion did it. More could follow. For that reason, remainers need to gird ourselves for Halloween, to have a comfort blanket in the drawer, ready to cling to if the worst happens. Which is why I\u2019ve been busy knitting these past few weeks, coming up with the arguments that might help us self-soothe. Here goes. Perhaps no deal is what it will take to cure the country of its Brexit fever. Maybe nothing less than a complete severance of all ties is the only way to snap ourselves out of this delirium. Until now, for example, the Brexiters have been able to cast every hitch and disappointment as the handiwork of wicked remainers bent on thwarting Britain\u2019s destiny. If there\u2019s been no stampede of unicorns towards the sunlit uplands, that\u2019s because the faint-hearts and fifth columnists connived with Brussels to deny the British people their will. A no-deal exit would end that betrayal myth once and for all. Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the others would have got everything they wanted. They would be unable to cry treachery, because we would have left the EU the way they demanded we leave. They\u2019d be unable to blame remainers or the judges or the BBC or the universities, because no one would have stood in their way. It will be their Brexit and they will have to own it. Next, the Brexiters have dismissed every warning as Project Fear, including Thursday\u2019s estimate from the Office for Budget Responsibility that no deal will kick a \u00a330bn dent in the public finances, a projection that the OBR\u2019s head explained was calculated on \u201crelatively benign\u201d figures and was avowedly \u201cnot at the most pessimistic end of the spectrum\u201d. So perhaps the only way the Brexiters will ever be convinced is when they see and feel the consequences of no deal not as rhetoric from their political adversaries but as cold, hard reality \u2013 when they, or their constituents, see the lorries backed up for miles at Dover, the supermarket shelves empty of food, the medical supplies running out. Above all, perhaps it will take the pain and chaos of a crash-out from the EU finally to lay to rest the imperial delusion that has long underpinned the Brexit cause. For decades, the conventional wisdom held that it took the humiliation of Suez to wake the British governing class from its dreams of empire and to realise Britain\u2019s true, more modest place in the world. But the Brexit process has surely revealed the opposite: that those fantasies endured long after 1956; that the notion of Britain as a global superpower, held back and denied glory by pettifogging continentals, refused to die. Perhaps, then, it will take the blow to national pride inflicted by a disastrous exit from the EU to force Britain\u2019s rulers to see the country as it actually is: no longer a global superpower, but instead a proud, successful nation whose strength depends not on breaking from its nearest neighbours but, in part, on its close ties to them. These are the patches I\u2019ve been stitching into a quilt ready to clutch the day Johnson and his enablers lead us to catastrophe. Like anyone who\u2019s ever lost something precious, I\u2019d find a way to tell myself it was for the best. But, sad to say, it won\u2019t work. I look upon this blanket of comfort and find it thin and threadbare. For one thing, how plausible is it to imagine that, even if Brexit is the total rupture Farage yearns for, he won\u2019t still insist that the people were betrayed and that this Brexit was insufficiently pure? The betrayal myth will not be dispelled by anything so weak as mere facts. Nor can we rely on the realisation of all those forecasts dismissed as Project Fear to shake Brexiters\u2019 faith. Even if there are no tomatoes in Asda and no insulin in the hospitals, Rees-Mogg won\u2019t blame himself or his fellow fanatics: he\u2019ll blame the government (or Theresa May, if Johnson gives him a job) for failing to prepare properly. And if, more likely, dawn breaks on 1 November and the sky has not fallen in, the Brexiters will claim victory. \u201cSee!\u201d they\u2019ll chirrup. \u201cAll those doom-mongers were wrong. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d Because it\u2019s possible that no deal won\u2019t trigger an instant calamity, but rather act as a slow puncture for the economy, tipping us into recession, steadily destroying 200,000 jobs and shrinking wages. Expectations of a no-deal exit are so low, if Britons are not living in the streets wearing animal skins and foraging for weevils by Christmas, the Brexiters will declare it a triumph. And even if it is an immediate disaster, visible on day one, there are few guarantees that leavers would admit their error and seek once more the embrace of Brussels. As Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform puts it, \u201cJust because babies are dying, does that mean they\u2019ll say we were better off in the EU?\u201d Aren\u2019t they just as likely to blame the beastly Europeans for inflicting such a hellscape on an innocent nation? After all, even Boris Johnson once thought Britain could leave the EU and keep its seat on the European council of ministers. The Brexiters will cry, \u201cHow we were to know that leaving the EU meant leaving the EU?\u201d And if they don\u2019t blame Brussels, they\u2019ll blame someone else: foreigners, minorities, anyone but themselves. Most important, even if a no-deal Brexit delivered sweet vindication for remainers, it would taste bitter. No deal remains an appalling prospect; to flirt with it is, as Grant observes, \u201cplaying with people\u2019s lives and livelihoods\u201d. We cannot wish disaster on the country solely to exorcise our demons. Instead we have to keep fighting it with all our might \u2013 knowing there will be no comfort blanket to soothe us. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

Because when you talk about all-rounders, you talk about someone who could hold their place in a team on either discipline. But where someone like Jacques Kallis may have done that as a third or fourth seamer, he wouldn\u2019t have been the first. The greats of the 1980s \u2013Imran, Hadlee, Kapil \u2013 tended to be great bowlers who were good batsmen. Perhaps good batsmen with great moments.</p> <p>But aside from Garfield Sobers, I can\u2019t think of anyone who was genuinely in the conversation for the very best in the world, at least in the best three or four, in both disciplines at the same time.</p> <p>Perry is.</p> <p>Maybe Keith Miller was?

She stutters enough, and so does Haynes, that midwicket throws at the non-striker\u2019s end. And misses. And gets an overthrow to <strong>raise her hundred</strong>. Rather emblematic of England\u2019s day. Two more singles follow.<br></p> <p>More emblematic, though, is Perry as a player in women\u2019s cricket. She becomes the fourth woman to make tons in back-to-back matches. All the more special given she\u2019s waited nearly two years between those chances. She\u2019s gone 313 runs without being dismissed, a record in the women\u2019s game. And she\u2019s still going and could go all day. On top of taking a seven-wicket bag the other week.

There have been a lot of last-chance moments for England in the past few weeks and here is another one. For the England women\u2019s team to have any chance of winning their Ashes series against Australia, they need to win this Test. To win this Test, they need to rattle through seven Australian wickets, make 500 runs, then take ten more wickets. In three days. It\u2019s hard, but so was landing on the moon, which everyone keeps reminding us about this week. (This match is admittedly less strategically important in a propaganda war against the Russians.)</p> <p>For Australia though, it\u2019s just a chance to bat and bat. Ellyse Perry is eyeing off a century, and that would be two in a row for the sport\u2019s most obscenely gifted and hardest-working player. (That\u2019s a winning combination.) Rachael Haynes has a fifty of her own and can see where that leads. And Australia don\u2019t actually need to win, since a draw would deliver them the series trophy, but I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re still very keen to push for a result, not just bat things out.</p> <p>As long as the rain stays away, get set for an eventful morning.</p> </div>   </div>",

Here, though, is Rory Carroll on the state of the sport in Ireland, who play England in a Test at Lord\u2019s next week: Another update from Taunton, and it\u2019s not good news: the rain has intensified, and play looks extremely unlikely to restart as currently scheduled in four minutes. NEWS! Tea will be taken at 3.40pm, and the umpires hope to resume play at 4pm. Looking at the forecast I\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s any more play today. It looks like it\u2019ll rain until well after 6pm, though at the moment it looks very light: there are still players on the outfield, and only a few spectators are bothering with brollies. Is is raining again in Taunton, and the proposed restart has been abandoned: Pictorial evidence of umpires inspecting the pitch at Taunton: And so it is. Play will restart in seven minutes, unless it doesn\u2019t. Waiting for news, though unless the meteorologists are way off key, the rain is about to resume and last for about three hours. Strictly speaking it should already be raining. Here is a picture of some umpires. Geoff reports that the England players are warming up on the field, playing a bit of football. The central pitch cover is still on, but the rest have been packed away. The pitch inspection should be imminent. Hello world! So if you could send your emails and stuff here, I\u2019d be much obliged. News from Taunton is: It is no longer raining! A pitch inspection has been scheduled for 3pm BST My rain radar thing suggests it should start to rain again at about 3pm BST So best not get too excited The outermost covers are being mopped up by the mopping machine, and will be very gradually removed. The rain has stopped for now. But we\u2019ll still be a fair way away from any action. Given the lull continues, perhaps now is as good a time as any for us to hand over the rainy baton. Simon Burnton will let you know if there\u2019s any further play, with Australia well on top in the match and England\u2019s hopes of a win disappearing by the minute. I think the rain has stopped. Yes, here come a few groundsmen, popping their little heads up like tulips in the spring. They like to stand around the pitch cover and chat. It\u2019s an important part of the process. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been busy rewatching the Soweto Gospel Choir singing Bluey. Still raining, though it\u2019s lighter. I\u2019d guess that with the less bountiful resources for the ground staff here, we\u2019d take an hour to get a restart even if the rain stops. The time is 13:53 BST! Exciting. If Harkarn Sumal prayed as indicated, then it worked. But somehow I think Harkarn came to a different conclusion by the end of this letter. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll break the emergency glass, unfurl the scroll of parchment that sits behind it, and read the old words aloud. \u2018Is it cowardly to pray for rain?\u2019 Not to give us a sneaky boost in our search for a draw that would clinch the Ashes, which was the hope when the words were first written 14 long years ago, but to avoid the fully warranted pasting that we\u2019re going to get here. The absolute state of this game. If the weather holds out, I see a declaration about an hour before the close today. Then our shell-shocked top order will have to traipse out and show some real gumption. We\u2019re already playing for pride now as far as I can see. Still, it\u2019s red ball cricket, and a good chance to measure where we stand in the grand scheme of things when there\u2019s nowhere to hide.\u201d Very sorry that I missed this perverse missive earlier. \u201cGot to say, given how unenjoyable this is, I\u2019m really enjoying it. So much of women\u2019s sport seems to have to combine the contest itself with trying to promote the brand. Great we have reached a point where the Aussies can just grind out a huge total without having to think about the wider effects. I\u2019d like to see them declare at about 6-550 before lunch tomorrow, Perry 276 not out. Old skool, Bill Lawry sort of stuff.\u201d Oh, Peter Salmon. Always swimming against the current. We\u2019ve had a bit of an email glitch this morning, so I didn\u2019t receive a bunch of emails in the first session. Apologies for that. I\u2019ll sort through a few now. First, Romeo. Not just a famous romantic lead (too obvious) but a very fun song by Basement Jaxx. (Also in an English cricket connection the album it was on is named Rooty.) Anyway, Romeo says, \u201cDo you think I would be safe in saying Ellyse Perry is one of the greatest of all time?\u201d Well, yes. Because when you talk about all-rounders, you talk about someone who could hold their place in a team on either discipline. But where someone like Jacques Kallis may have done that as a third or fourth seamer, he wouldn\u2019t have been the first. The greats of the 1980s \u2013Imran, Hadlee, Kapil \u2013 tended to be great bowlers who were good batsmen. Perhaps good batsmen with great moments. But aside from Garfield Sobers, I can\u2019t think of anyone who was genuinely in the conversation for the very best in the world, at least in the best three or four, in both disciplines at the same time. Perry is. Maybe Keith Miller was? Maybe Botham for a hot minute, but his batting was usually more revelatory than dependable. Maybe a few of the pioneers of the late 1800s. Maybe Unaarrimin in the 1860s and 1870s. But very few. I regret to inform you that it\u2019s now hammering down rain at the ground in Taunton. Heavy and looking set-in. We\u2019ll keep you updated but any return to play will be at the least delayed by a fair margin. The juggernaut rolls (very, very slowly) on. This is the steamroller scene from Austin Powers. In whites. \u201cA side that is reaping the benefits of professional development and most importantly; backing from the top rung of the ladder: CA and its various corporate sponsors versus a side made up of fellow professionals... but that\u2019s where the similarities stop, don\u2019t they. \u201cIn this present Australian team we have some players who are just generationally [sic] brilliant, confirming that what Australia is doing with women\u2019s cricket is successful. \u201cThis is not a put down of English women\u2019s cricket but a fervent wish that the ECB via its commercial sponsors and media obligations can and should do more to support the game. That can surely financially support more than 15 women who make up the squad that is currently selected. The money needs to go out to the counties and to those players who sacrifice far more in some circumstances than their counterparts in the men\u2019s game. \u201cNo DRS in an Ashes Test? Surely we could pass the hat around to pay for it. Ridiculous it\u2019s not there.\u201d 132nd over: Australia 341-5 (Mooney 7, Jonassen 4) Mooney trying to repeat the dose against Gordon, as the clock ticks down. Defending from the crease. Two short legs and a slip in place. Lots of chatter on the field. Trying to dial up the pressure. But they may as well dial up some take-away. Mooney does it comfortably, and the umpires tip the bails off. Lunch time! And a suggestion that Haynes may have got an edge on the ball that got her out. Which leads into an email from Lee Henderson... 131st over: Australia 341-5 (Mooney 7, Jonassen 4) Marsh to Mooney, who is trying just to get through to lunch, blocking out an over bar one single. 130th over: Australia 340-5 (Mooney 6, Jonassen 4) Why would send Jess Jonassen in ahead of your debutantes? Surely the best plan would be to get them a hit, plus someone like Gardner could boost the total quickly? Not that JJ doesn\u2019t deserve a chance to have a hit: I was there in 2015 for her 99 at Canterbury and it was an absolute gem of an innings. But still... the indications here are that Australia will just bat until they\u2019re bowled out. Which could be tomorrow. Jonassen will give some entertainment before then though, starting with an advance and a gorgeous cover drive from Gordon for four. 129th over: Australia 335-5 (Mooney 5) Gone, last ball of the over. Finally the other Australian sentinel falls, and it\u2019s another near miss for Rachael Haynes on the hunt for a Test hundred. Simple enough dismissal: shapes to sweep, misses, straightens down the line, hit in front. 128th over: Australia 333-4 (Haynes 86, Mooney 4) Just a single from Gordon, and it\u2019s a triple Nelson score for Australia. 127th over: Australia 332-4 (Haynes 85, Mooney 4) One of the other considerations with women\u2019s Tests being so few is that it can affect the tactics. Say you\u2019re the Australian captain. You have Ash Gardner and Sophie Molineux on debut. If you declare now, they may not even get the chance to bat in their first and possibly only Test match. England could collapse twice, or rain could mean Australia don\u2019t bat again. So do you bat on to give them the experience? Hard not to, when you don\u2019t actually need to win the match. Mooney adds three runs with a nice cut from Marsh. Good cricket, good save on the rope. 126th over: Australia 328-4 (Haynes 84, Mooney 1) It will be interesting to see how Mooney plays. She opens in the WBBL and is an attacking type, but one of the many drawbacks of playing so few Test matches is that there\u2019s a huge amount riding on each innings when these women go out to bat. They know that one mistake here and you\u2019ll be waiting two and a half years for the chance to even be picked in the next team. So it can obviously make players go into their shells. Haynes also wants to make sure that 98 doesn\u2019t remain her highest Test score. She advances to Gordon to lift four over mid-on. Mooney nudges a single to open her account. 125th over: Australia 322-4 (Haynes 79, Mooney 0) Perry was trying to get on with things, having just thumped Marsh through midwicket for four the ball before being caught. Beth Mooney next in. Finally, her vigil ends! 329 Test runs between dismissals, spanning 2017 to the present day, and 116 runs in this match. She was trying to force the pace and fell that way, mistiming a full toss for the first time this innings, hitting it low to Knight at short midwicket. In truth Perry timed it as she did all day yesterday, but she just didn\u2019t adjust her shot for the closer catcher. 124th over: Australia 315-3 (Perry 112, Haynes 79) Three more singles from Gordon. 123rd over: Australia 315-3 (Perry 110, Haynes 78) Now Perry wants to go! Hangs back to Marsh, once, twice, thrice. Then as Marsh goes a bit fuller, Perry dances down the wicket to turn it into a half volley, and lifts it gloriously for four! One bounce down the ground, good strike. Takes a single last ball. 122nd over: Australia 310-3 (Perry 105, Haynes 78) Perry advances to Gordon, but can\u2019t beat midwicket. Then taps to midwicket and takes off for a quick single. Would have been run out! Sciver\u2019s throw missed, and Perry gets away with it. Now we have a someone named Gordon bowling to someone named Haynes. Whose nickname is Desmond. Lovely. This is the best cricket name pairing since I met the ICC broadcast manager: Lara Richards. 121st over: Australia 309-3 (Perry 104, Haynes 78) Laura Marsh in a double change with her off-spin. A couple of singles the only score. What is Australia\u2019s game here? What\u2019s the point? There\u2019s a real lack of anything out there. 120th over: Australia 307-3 (Perry 103, Haynes 77) Kirstie Gordon on to bowl. Heather Knight hasn\u2019t exactly swung the changes at any stage in this innings, despite the Australians enduring everything sent down. Knight hasn\u2019t bowled her off-breaks at all, for instance. Gordon drops short but Perry can\u2019t punish the wide ball. Charlotte Edwards has a theory that short and wide is Perry\u2019s one weakness at the moment, and she didn\u2019t time that at all. The chop shot limped to point. Gordon is better aside from that ball. Bowls a maiden. 119th over: Australia 307-3 (Perry 103, Haynes 77) Swat! That\u2019s more like it. Haynes gets a ball from Sciver that isn\u2019t really short, and she\u2019s not exactly playing a pull shot \u2013 the arc of the bat across the line is diagonal, starting low and then lifting as it comes around her body. Lifting the ball over square leg for four. Haynes can motor in short-form cricket, so it would be good to see her tilt closer to that mode. 118th over: Australia 302-3 (Perry 103, Haynes 73) Perry takes a single from Ecclestone casually, while Haynes skips down and tries to slam an off-drive, but only gets one run wide of mid-off. 117th over: Australia 301-3 (Perry 102, Haynes 72) Sciver resumes to Haynes, who tries a few shots but can\u2019t beat the field. To be fair it does look hard to time attacking strokes out there. The wicket is becoming pretty lifeless. 116th over: Australia 301-3 (Perry 102, Haynes 72) A bit more proactive in the over before drinks, with Perry advancing to Ecclestone for a run, then Haynes trying a big swipe across the line for a couple. Here\u2019s hoping they lift the tempo after a bev. The 300 is up, if you didn\u2019t read the line at the top. 115th over: Australia 297-3 (Perry 101, Haynes 69) Perry isn\u2019t the type you associate with nerves, but she is getting nervous now. She steers to backward point and sets off for a run but gets sent back. Then again, the same process. Sciver bowls a third time. Perry flicks to midwicket and isn\u2019t sure whether to run. She stutters enough, and so does Haynes, that midwicket throws at the non-striker\u2019s end. And misses. And gets an overthrow to raise her hundred. Rather emblematic of England\u2019s day. Two more singles follow. More emblematic, though, is Perry as a player in women\u2019s cricket. She becomes the fourth woman to make tons in back-to-back matches. All the more special given she\u2019s waited nearly two years between those chances. She\u2019s gone 313 runs without being dismissed, a record in the women\u2019s game. And she\u2019s still going and could go all day. On top of taking a seven-wicket bag the other week. She is a cricketer dominating like few have at any level in the history of the sport, let alone internationally. 113th over: Australia 294-3 (Perry 99, Haynes 68) Ecclestone has to pull herself together to bowl now, and again Haynes blots up most of the over before finding a run. Someone with her experience should be more aware in this context. Perry keeps the strike for herself this time though by driving one through cover from the last ball. One run away. 112th over: Australia 292-3 (Perry 98, Haynes 67) Oh, you have got to be kidding me. Dropped. Haynes is dropped, after this stubborn partnership has worn England\u2019s fabric to frayed thread. There was the chance to end it. Error from the bat: Sciver bowled short, Haynes pulled in the air, straight to Ecclestone at square leg. Her weakness is her fielding, but that was as simple as they get. A bit of loop, just to her right, one she can take with a steady footing. And the ball just... pops out. England are going to lose by a million now. There\u2019s nothing more deflating than that. And once again, Haynes soaks up five balls of strike so Perry can\u2019t get a clear run at her hundred. This isn\u2019t great batting, either. 111th over: Australia 291-3 (Perry 98, Haynes 66) Perry doesn\u2019t go for the milestone in the Nelson over. Content to do as she has done and drive a single from Ecclestone after advancing. Haynes does likewise. They\u2019re just doing things at their own pace. 110th over: Australia 289-3 (Perry 97, Haynes 65) Now it\u2019s Sciver to Haynes, who soaks up another over but this time she drives the fifth ball cleanly along the ground for four, rather than taking one. Perry gets strike for the next over. 109th over: Australia 285-3 (Perry 97, Haynes 61) With Perry closing on a century, it\u2019s Haynes on strike as Sophie Ecclestone comes on for her first over of left-arm spin. She drops the ball into the rough outside the left-hander\u2019s off stump, and Haynes defends four balls before taking a single. You\u2019ll have to wait, Ellyse. 108th over: Australia 284-3 (Perry 97, Haynes 60) Natalie Sciver on to have a bowl with her mediums. She had Healy nearly caught at midwicket yesterday. Bowls full and Perry drives her hard into the ground and bounces it back down the ground for four! A pragmatic sort of stroke. Sciver responds though with a beauty. Better length, just full enough to draw the shot but it swings, and beats Perry\u2019s drive and her off stump by equally narrow margins. The TV folks are speculating she might have nicked it into Sarah Taylor\u2019s shin pad, but I\u2019m not sure she did. Sciver continues getting swing, but Perry flicks two runs square when the ball gets too straight. 107th over: Australia 277-3 (Perry 90, Haynes 60) Haynes comes to life, crunching a pull shot off Shrubsole but straight to the field. She\u2019s very quick on the short ball in short-form cricket, is Haynes. Shrubsole hoops one in onto the pads, but well down leg side. In the end Haynes jabs a run off her thigh pad, and Perry taps one into the covers. 106th over: Australia 275-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 59) Brunt round the wicket to the left-handed Haynes. One slip and a gully in position. Point, cover, extra cover, mid-off. Packed off side field with only mid-on and midwicket plus a long leg on the other side, so Haynes walks across her stumps and works the off-stump line to square leg. Sensible batting. Perry has a more conventional field, with one less cover moved over to square leg, Shrubsole set quite deep to give Brunt the option of the short ball and protect her from Perry\u2019s very good pull shot. Perry tries a steer to deep third but finds gully on the bounce. 105th over: Australia 274-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 58) Another maiden bowled, as Shrubsole works away at Perry\u2019s off stump. This Australian pair look happy to just bat through this opening spell and then see where that leaves them as the day winds on. The beauty of playing without pressure to score. 104th over: Australia 274-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 58) Brunt bowls pretty straight at Haynes, trying to force her to play, but the Aussie v-c is comfortable defending from the crease. Blocks out a maiden. 103rd over: Australia 274-3 (Perry 89, Haynes 58) Perry goes past 300 runs without dismissal in Test cricket, following her 213 at North Sydney in her previous Test. She punches Shrubsole away through cover for four, a bit airily but safely. Shrubsole responds with a few decent deliveries, pitching up a bit more, including one that beats the edge. 102nd over: Australia 270-3 (Perry 85, Haynes 58) Brunt to Perry, and this is the key match-up. If England don\u2019t remove Australia\u2019s top gun then she\u2019ll fly all day. (Oh god that\u2019s an accidental plug for the awful remake featuring a Tom Cruise who is now made of plasticine and an Ed Harris who is so, so sad that he\u2019s still alive, sentences to some sort of Promethean fate of having to play cranky admirals for eternity.) Brunt angles a ball in and hits the pad, but it\u2019s going well down leg. Perry blocks out and then pinches a single to end the over with a straight punch. 101st over: Australia 269-3 (Perry 84, Haynes 58) Anya Shrubsole to start things off, and despite the heavy atmosphere there\u2019s not much movement off the straight and narrow with this 20-over old ball. There is a chance though, as Shrubsole gives width and Haynes can\u2019t resist slashing at the ball, getting a big top edge between gully and slip from the angled bat. Four runskis. Good news, we\u2019re going to get a start on time. It may rain later, but we\u2019ll battle on for the start. It\u2019s so humid here today, and very warm. Sticky, heavy atmosphere. Let\u2019s play. Here is your highly detailed local weather update: it was raining earlier. It is not raining now. It may be raining later. Give me a job! If there was one thing that stood out on the first day, it was the ruthlessness of this Australian team, even through a couple of patches where England competed. There\u2019s something ominous about the way Australia has played in this series. Luckily I already wrote about it for you last night. Here we go again. There have been a lot of last-chance moments for England in the past few weeks and here is another one. For the England women\u2019s team to have any chance of winning their Ashes series against Australia, they need to win this Test. To win this Test, they need to rattle through seven Australian wickets, make 500 runs, then take ten more wickets. In three days. It\u2019s hard, but so was landing on the moon, which everyone keeps reminding us about this week. (This match is admittedly less strategically important in a propaganda war against the Russians.) For Australia though, it\u2019s just a chance to bat and bat. Ellyse Perry is eyeing off a century, and that would be two in a row for the sport\u2019s most obscenely gifted and hardest-working player. (That\u2019s a winning combination.) Rachael Haynes has a fifty of her own and can see where that leads. And Australia don\u2019t actually need to win, since a draw would deliver them the series trophy, but I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re still very keen to push for a result, not just bat things out. As long as the rain stays away, get set for an eventful morning.",

      "bodyText": "Episodes of on-course levity appear key to Lee Westwood\u2019s continued competitiveness. Old school caddies probably looked on with scepticism when Westwood opted to place his girlfriend, Helen Storey, on the bag after the end of a long-term connection with Billy Foster. Westwood, and Storey, are enjoying the last laugh. Westwood\u2019s 67 on Friday moved him to seven under and firmly into Open Championship contention. Storey took up caddying duties at the end of last year but this marks her first major. Westwood was asked what on-course discussion generally entails. \u201cDinner, where we\u2019re going on holiday,\u201d he replied with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised the sort of things we talk about out there. The favourite one was from Denmark the first week she caddied for me and I took out a divot because it was big and soft and she\u2019s walking back with the divot. I said: \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 She said: \u2018I hope there\u2019s not a worm in this.\u2019 It makes me smile. It\u2019s a big advantage. \u201cShe\u2019s delighted because they\u2019ve got their own rakers here. She doesn\u2019t have to rake the bunkers.\u201d Joking aside, Westwood has enjoyed taking ownership of his game, where he need not rely on a caddie for shot detail. \u201cObviously I get on well with Helen,\u201d added the former world No 1. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know too much about golf but she knows a lot about the way my mind works. So she keeps me in a good frame of mind and focusing on the right things at the right time. There\u2019s more to the caddying than carrying and getting the wind direction. Get the yardage, pull the club, it\u2019s all my responsibility, and I\u2019m 100% clear in my mind what I\u2019m doing.\u201d This Open marks the 10th anniversary of a Westwood close shave at Turnberry, where Stewart Cink prevailed. Now 46 and regarded as one of the finest players not to have won a major, the Englishman places no expectation whatsoever on himself in these environments. \u201cThere\u2019s no pressure on me,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cI just go out there and have fun. I\u2019ve never felt under that much pressure, to be honest. You lads write about it, I\u2019ve always gone out and done my best. If it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to happen, and if it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t. Go home and have dinner, go on holiday the next week. Do the same things, life won\u2019t change.\u201d",

Late on Friday his legal team said a compromise had been reached and the former president had agreed to submit statements to the inquiry in response to specific questions. The inquiry is mandated to investigate allegations of \u201cstate capture\u201d in South Africa during Zuma\u2019s presidency, which ended last year when he was ousted amid graft allegations. It was set up after an ombudsman\u2019s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers, Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, and senior officials in Zuma\u2019s administration. The report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour had taken place, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies had acted improperly. In testimony on Monday, Zuma said he had been smeared and that he was the victim of a conspiracy organised by foreign intelligence agencies. On Tuesday, he appeared increasingly uncomfortable as he was questioned by Raymond Zondo, the senior judge who chairs the inquiry. There were concerns Zuma might use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, who led the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to a convincing election victory in May but has so far been unable to fully assert his authority over the party. But such fears have so far proved unfounded. The ANC is deeply divided between factions loyal to Zuma and reformists who support Ramaphosa. Zuma appointed loyalists to hundreds of top positions in the police, tax revenue service, intelligence agencies and other public bodies. Ramaphosa, a labour activist and tycoon who served as Zuma\u2019s vice-president, faces attacks from another state anti-graft agency over donations he received for his campaign to lead the ANC in 2017. Busisiwe Mkhwebane, an ombudsman constitutionally charged to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by state officials, told reporters on Friday that Ramaphosa had \u201cdeliberately misled\u201d parliament about a 500,000 rand (\u00a328,700) donation and violated the constitution. Questioned by opposition politicians, Ramaphosa first said the donation had been a consultancy fee paid to his son Andile by a company implicated in corruption of government officials. The president revised his answer in November to say that the money had in fact been a donation to his campaign fund. Mkhwebane accepted that the mistake had been made \u201cin good faith\u201d but said the president should \u201chave allowed himself sufficient time to research \u2026 a well-informed response\u201d. This amounted to deliberate deception and was thus unethical and unconstitutional, she said, a charge that Ramaphosa\u2019s allies said was contradictory and would be challenged in court. Ramaphosa has repeatedly said he would be prepared to appear before the commission. The charge against the president will undermine his efforts to purge the ANC of Zuma\u2019s supporters and distract attention from the Zondo inquiry. The ombudsman, known as the public protector, is appointed by the president on the recommendation of a parliamentary panel. This year, Mkhwebane\u2019s report into a scandal involving huge government grants to a dairy farm was declared invalid by a court because of investigative shortcomings, particularly a failure to examine the role of senior ANC officials close to Zuma. Mkhwebane has also claimed that the public enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, a close ally of Ramaphosa, abused his powers during a stint as finance minister. Gordhan has denied the charge, which is seen as an indirect attack on the president.

Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 You have to wonder at the mind of a prime minister who can rail at Brexit absolutists (May swipes at \u2018rancour and hatred\u2019 of Brexit absolutists, 18 July) after fronting a minority government kept in office only by a party of the 10 most uncompromising MPs in the UK, having set her own red lines without consulting with other parties on what kind of Brexit we should have, and who put forward the same rejected plan over and over because she could conceive of no other way forward. Mark Lewinski Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire \u2022 Theresa May could give real effect to her \u201ccoded swipe\u201d at the Brexiters who undermined her premiership by using her final day as prime minister to revoke article 50. Kip Bennett West Drayton, London \u2022 I note Theresa May\u2019s advocacy of enhanced paternity leave (Journal, 19 July) and wonder if she\u2019d consider making it compulsory. That way, who knows how many days a possible future prime minister would be kept from his office and prevented from inflicting more damage on the country.

Where are the <em>domestiques </em>and plucky challengers for stage wins that other nations seem to supply by the bucket load? </p> <p>\u201cThe other major Western European nations always seem to have numbers well into the teens, while we struggle to get to eight or nine, with just six this year. Obviously we\u2019re not going to be challenging France or Belgium for numbers into the 20s or 30s, but it puzzles me that we don\u2019t have a dozen or so at least, on a par with Germany, Spain or the Netherlands.</p> <p>\u201cI guess there\u2019s some structural reason in how the sport is run in the UK (more focus on and funding for track / Olympic medals?) and maybe the weather and lack of space reduce the chances for quality road racing. But at a recreational level, country roads are full of cyclists, and at the very highest level we\u2019re the envy of the world, so it seems odd that there aren\u2019t plenty of talented riders just below that getting placers in the World Tour teams.</p> <p>\u201cAny insights?\u201d</p> <p>Nope, none whatsoever, I\u2019m afraid.

Unlike Ineos, Mitchelton Scott seem happy to give their leader\u2019s lieutenants the opportunity to win stages while simultaneously focussing on the GC standing of Adam Yates.

Almost 24 hours later, mystery continues to surround the Australian\u2019s decision. The world ITT champion, Dennis was among the favourites for today\u2019s stage, but abandoned the Tour despite not being ill or injured. Although he was spotted near his team bus at the end of the stage, he refused to speak to reporters and his team were vague when asked about what happened too.</p> <p>\u201cWe actually expected a big effort from him tomorrow,\u201d said Bahrain-Merida sports director Gorazd Stangelj. \u201cIt was his decision today to stop in the feed zone. We tried to speak with him. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk\u2019 and just abandoned the race. His condition is not bad, he\u2019s good enough to perform at the Tour de France. For sure it has nothing to do with his condition.\u201d</p> <p>A notoriously spiky character, Dennis is rumoured to be unhappy with the Merida time trial bike he is obliged to use because of his team\u2019s sponsors. Speaking to Lance Armstrong\u2019s The Move podcast, former Radioshack and US Postal team director Johan Bruyneel, suggested there was also talk that Dennis spat the dummy because there was something wrong with the skin-suit he was due to wear today. It didn\u2019t fit, or hadn\u2019t turned up ... something like that. While Bruyneel\u2019s every utterance should be taken with several shovelfuls of salt, for obvious reasons, he is exceptionally well connected in the world of professional cycling, so there may well be more than a grain of truth to what he is saying. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"969f15f5cbea486afcfe250bfe3d55411a62bde0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/969f15f5cbea486afcfe250bfe3d55411a62bde0/0_111_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohan Dennis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rohan Dennis abandoned the Tour de France yesterday in mysterious circumstances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d31a6468f08cf92bb772fc9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-19T11:21:36.340Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Tour de France </h2> <p>With the ladies finished, it\u2019s time to return our focus to the gentlemen, who have their Race of Truth this afternoon.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s today\u2019s report on what could prove to be a crucial stage. Jeremy Whittle\u2019s report with follow later. Wout van Aert update: It was a very bad day indeed for the young Belgian, who won a sprint finish earlier this week. He suffered a sickening crash into a barrier after misjudging a turn and has been taken to hospital. \u201cAccording to French TV, Van Aert has a deep cut on his leg but no fractures,\u201d writes Matt Cast. General Classification There was late heartbreak for Thomas De Gendt on a day when Julian Alaphilippe stoke the show. Geraint Thomas, Steven Kruijswijk, Enric Mas and Egan Bernal all had good days. For Dan Martin, Nairo Quintana and Jakob Fugslang, it was an afternoon of frustration. Julian Alaphilippe increases his lead. On a day many thought Julian Philippe might lose the yellow jersey or at least a considerable chunk of his lead, he has increased his lead on General Classification ahead of tomorrow\u2019s jaunt up the Tourmalet. The Frenchman is roared home by the locals of Pau and wins the stage by a scarcely credible 14 seconds. What! A! Performance! Geraint Thomas: The Welshman takes the lead, finishing the course 21 seconds quicker than Thomas De Gendt. Egan Bernal: The Colombian Ineos rider finishes over a minute in arrears. Julian Alaphilippe: The Frenchman in the yellow jersey is doing the garment proud on this, the day of it\u2019s 100th anniversary. He\u2019s five seconds quicker than Geraint Thomas at the third split. Steven Kruijswijk: A fine ride from the Dutchman, who is nine seconds slower than our clubhouse leader. That could move him up to third on GC. Geraint Thomas: The Welshman is quickest at the third split, the 21.9km mark, stopping the clock at 28min 40sec. That\u2019s 21 seconds faster than TDG, who must be shifting nervously in his stage leader\u2019s throne. Enrique Mas: Alaphilippe\u2019s team-mate puts in a good shift, finishing 22 seconds off the pace. Adam Yates: The Mitchelton Scott team leader finishes the course, 1min 32sec down on the leader. Nairo Quintana: The Movistar rider finishes the course 1min 15sec down on Thomas De Gendt. Julian Alaphilippe: The maillot jaune hits the second split and it\u2019s an incredible team from Julian Alaphilippe. He gets there six seconds quicker than Thomas. His time: 21min 48sec. Geraint Thomas: The defending champion obliterates Kruijswijk\u2019s time at the 15.5km mark, taking 13 seconds out of the Dutchman. He stops the clock at 21min 54sec. Steven Kruijswijk: The Dutchman is quickest at the second split: 22min 07sec. That\u2019s five seconds quicker than De Gendt. Thibaut Pinot: The Frenchman, in 10th place on GC, hits the final ramp and is going to post a good time. The clock goes from green to red and Pinot finishes 13 seconds off the pace set by De Gendt. That\u2019s a good effort. Rigoberto Uran: Thomas De Gendt is seen grimacing nervously in the Big Chair, as Rigoberto Uran crosses the finish line. He\u2019s not quite quick enough, but less than one third of a second slower than the stage leader. Julian Alaphilippe: Taking adsvantage of the superpowers he appears to glean from the yellow jersey, Julian Alaphilippe is quickest past the first check point: 11min 17sec. Chapeau. Steven Kruijswijk: The Jumbo-Visma rider clocks the fastest time at the first check point: 11min 22sec. Geraint Thomas takes a second longer to get there. Nairo Quintana: At the same point, Nairo Quintana is 40 seconds down. Team Ineos rider Egan Bernal hits the 7.7km check point 12 seconds down on De Gendt. Dan Martin is struggling. In ninth place on GC this morning, the UAE Team Emirates rider has lost over a minute at the 15.5km time check. Thibaut Pinot is rocking and rolling. At the second time check, he clocks 22min 25sec. De Gendt got there 13 seconds quicker. Thomas De Gendt leads the stage. Richie Porte has just muscled his way into second position, while Kasper Asgreen is in third. The time to beat is 35min 36sec. A sterling effort from Richie Porte: The Trek Segafredo rider finishes nine seconds down on Thomas De Gendt, moments before Team Ineos rider Geraint Thomas rolls down the ramp of the starter\u2019s hut. Thomas De Gendt: The Belgian has been quickest at every checkpoint and remains the stage leader with a time of 35min 36sec. Just four riders left to go: Steven Kruijswijk, Egan Bernal, Geraint Thomas and Julian Alaphilippe are locked and loaded. Wout van Aert Here\u2019s a slightly less grisly overhead view of the crash that did for the unfortunate Wout, for those who are interested in seeing it. It look like he might have caught his handlebars in a slightly flappy bit of branding hanging from the barrier. 153 riders have started. Romain Bardet has just started. There are 13 riders left warming up behind the starter\u2019s hut, while Thomas De Gendt is happy in Big Chair, having posted a time of 35min 36sec, that is going to take some beating. Another crash: The camera cuts to Bora Hansgrohe rider Max Schachman who is looking very sorry for himself indeed as he approaches the finish line. He\u2019s clearly come down at some point and has blood on one knee and his holing his left arm very gingerly indeed. He grimaces with agony as he makes his way up the final climb and can barely hold the handlebars. I have a feeling his Tour may be over - I\u2019m no doctor, but that looks like a broken collarbone - or possibly wrist - to me, to go with his badly cut right knee. Shaking his head and clearly in great pain, he rolls over the line. More on the state of British cycling: \u201cBritain\u2019s club format is all about Time Trials as stage races are far harder to organise,\u201d writes Vic Lanser. \u201cClosing roads is less easily tolerated than in France or Belgium, where the sport is much bigger. TTs take place early in the morning, when traffic is lighter (but maybe not much safer: accidents do happen).\u201d FYI: The riders are now going out at two-minute intervals. Astana rider Alexey Lutsenko, time trial and road champion of Kazakhstan, has just left the starter\u2019s hut. Just 24 riders left to start: The main GC contenders will be out soon. Wout van Aert update: \u201c Belgian TV talked to Van Aert\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d writes Franky Vlaeminck. \u201cApparently no broken bones but a deep cut in the upper thigh is the worry.\u201d Peter Sagan pulls a wheelie: Ever the entertainer, the Jolly Green Giant cycles up the final climb and over the line on just his back wheel. He\u2019s 2min 57sec off the fastest time so far. More musings on GB riders: \u201cIn response to Aidan Grant\u2019s question,\u201d writes Rob Betts. These stats from Procycling.com may help. GB is 7th on the list of active riders, fewer than Spain, Germany and Netherlands, but on a par with USA and Colombia. I think there\u2019s a sense that continental European nations represent the core of pro cycling, while GB, USA, Colombia and Australia represent the \u2018new world\u2019 which is still establishing itself at a pro level. That said we\u2019re only nine riders behind Spain as a traditional cycling nation. \u201cIt could also be that the main \u2018British\u2019 team Ineos, has shifted it\u2019s focus away from bringing through British riders and is more focused on recruiting the best of the best. In previous years we\u2019ve seen Stannard, Swift, Kennaugh etc. on domestique duty.\u201d We have a new clubhouse leader: Lotto Soudal rider Thomas De Gendt is currently sitting in Big Chair, having posted a time of 35min 36sec, finishing the course a full 16 seconds quicker than previous leader Kasper Asgreen. In more important news, Wout van Aert has been stabilised on the roadside after his crash and is about to be taken to a local hospital. His injuries are, as yet, unspecified. Book recommendations: Having taken time out of his day to compile a list of the cycling books recommended on this blog last Friday, Robert Horne is now being subjected to a deluge of abuse from assorted readers for not including various books that weren\u2019t recommended; books they would like to have recommended to them even though they have already read them. Please direct your rage elsewhere, ideally somewhere more worthy than my email inbox! Wout van Aert: I\u2019d have to question the wisdom of the Tour broadcasters showing two or three replays of that Wout van Aert crash, as I\u2019ve a fairly strong constitution and the sight of it has made me feel queasy. I\u2019m not sure exactly how it happened, but he was tight against a roadside barrier covered in branding as he took a fairly tight right turn on a narrow stretch of road. He seems to have snagged on something - a cable-tie, perhaps? - that gouged his right thigh and violently brought him to ground. It was a hideous crash and he hit the deck very, very hard. An ambulance has been summoned to come to his aid. Without wanting to sound callous, I\u2019m not sure whether or not its presence will affect those coming behind Van Aert, or require a delay in the start times of those yet to begin the course until that particular section of it has been cleared. Wout van Aert crashes: Oh no! Wout van Aert has just suffered a sickening crash, going into a barrier while taking a right turn. He looks very badly hurt and in urgent need of medical attention. Fingers crossed for the young Belgian - his Tour is over. That was an awful crash. More book chat: \u201cWhy no mention of Nicole Cooke\u2019s \u2018The Breakaway\u2019 in the list of recommended cycling books?\u201d asks Barry Norris. The answer? Because nobody recommended it ... until now. \u201cNicole Cooke was world and Olympic champion in the same year (2008) \u2013 has any male rider done that yet? - and one of the greatest female cyclists that GB has ever produced,\u201d adds Barry. \u201cThe Breakaway is an insightful, opinionated, at times caustic read that holds nothing back. Wouldn\u2019t it be good to have at least one female rider\u2019s book in the current all-male list of recommended books?\u201d Meanwhile back at the Tour de France, Kasper Asgreen\u2019s time of 35min 52sec is still the one to beat with 123 riders either finished or still out on the course. Book chat: \u201cWith respect to that list, the best book about cycling by far is The Death of Marco Pantani by Matt Rendell,\u201d writes David Singerman. \u201cIt\u2019s a great biography, period, showing how the individual genius at its center was shaped by the social, political, and cultural context of Italy. I picked it up by chance in a Heathrow bookstore and am still glad I succumbed to the impulse.\u201d An email: \u201cIn response to Aidan Grant I\u2019d note that there is only one \u2018British\u2019 World Tour team while there are several French and Belgium teams,\u201d writes C. \u201cAnd Ineos of course just buy whoever\u2019s best with no regard to nationality. Perhaps British riders are reluctant to join teams abroad?\u201d But here comes Thomas de Gendt: The Lotto-Soudal breakaway specialist obliterates Van Aert\u2019s time, knocking 16 seconds off it. Thomas De Gendt stops the clock at the second checkpoint in 22min 12sec. Wout van Aert hits the second time check: And he\u2019s the quickest so far after 15.5km. He posts a time of 22min 28sec. An email: \u201cIn my young na\u00efve state (up until 48 years old), I always used to think that every rider went full gas on a TT, thinking that as they were professional sportsmen, they must be trying to win,\u201d writes Simon Thomas. |It gradually dawned on me that only probably 20% of the field are actually trying today \u2013 the rest are having a bit of a useful workout. You can\u2019t go too slow though. Hiroki Nishimura, a Japanese development rider, actually suffered the indignity of missing the time cut on the 8km prologue at this year\u2019s Giro. Imagine that happening to Sagan today!\u201d Sagan has just rolled down the ramp from the starting hut - I suspect he won\u2019t miss the cut. More on the tactics of Ineos v the tactics of Mitchelton Scott. \u201cJust on Simon Yates, I think there\u2019s a balance to be had between saving yourself and stretching the legs into some good form,\u201d writes Conor Lundy. \u201cYates (Simon) had a disappointing Giro and just didn\u2019t seem to have the form. \u201cYesterday would have been a good boost for him and the team to know he has good legs. It would have been of no use to Adam Yates if Simon had waited until a critical stage before finding out he wouldn\u2019t be able to help. That\u2019s one possibility. The other is that he just likes racing bikes and his team likes their racers to race. Anyone But Ineos!\u201d Speaking of young Simon, yesterday\u2019s stage winner has just passed the second time check and won\u2019t be troubling the podium today. He\u2019s 2min 16sec off the quickest time, set by CCC rider Joey Rosskopf. Robert Horne is having a productive day at work: \u201cI appreciated all the cycling book recommendations from last Friday\u2019s MBM but failed at the time to take any notes so spent the 20 minutes before my lunch break today going through it and compiling a list of them for other readers who also failed to take note,\u201d he says. \u201cI also very much enjoyed Phil Gaimon\u2019s Draft Animals. Probably not quite as well written as some of the other recommended reading but I thought it was an interesting and humble insight from someone who nearly made it. The Waterstones on Deansgate in Manchester had most of these too when I went at lunch time Slaying the Badger \u2013 Richard Moore In Search of Robert Millar \u2013 Richard Moore Racing through the Dark \u2013 David Millar Need for the Bike \u2013 Paul Fournel Tomorrow We Ride \u2013 Jean Bobet Rough Ride \u2013 Paul Kimmage Higher Calling \u2013 Max Leonard The Rider \u2013 Tim Krabb\u00e9 Escape Artist: Life from the Saddle \u2013 Matt Seaton Lanterne Rouge \u2013 Max Leonard An email: And it\u2019s an epic, from Aidan Grant. \u201cBrowsing through the start times for today\u2019s time trial I was reminded of a question that I\u2019ve never really got a satisfactory answer to \u2026 why are there still so few British riders in the Tour? \u201cDespite three different Brits having won six of the last seventh (and a 4th winning the Vuelta as three different Brits won all the Grand Tours last year) plus the greatest sprinter of his generation (and arguably all-time), and countless medals on the track, the places only seem to go to Brits right at the top end. Where are the domestiques and plucky challengers for stage wins that other nations seem to supply by the bucket load? \u201cThe other major Western European nations always seem to have numbers well into the teens, while we struggle to get to eight or nine, with just six this year. Obviously we\u2019re not going to be challenging France or Belgium for numbers into the 20s or 30s, but it puzzles me that we don\u2019t have a dozen or so at least, on a par with Germany, Spain or the Netherlands. \u201cI guess there\u2019s some structural reason in how the sport is run in the UK (more focus on and funding for track / Olympic medals?) and maybe the weather and lack of space reduce the chances for quality road racing. But at a recreational level, country roads are full of cyclists, and at the very highest level we\u2019re the envy of the world, so it seems odd that there aren\u2019t plenty of talented riders just below that getting placers in the World Tour teams. \u201cAny insights?\u201d Nope, none whatsoever, I\u2019m afraid. But somebody else might have. Oliveira slows down. Despite a farily heroic effort, Nelson isn\u2019t quite quick enough and finishes 10 seconds down on the Danish champion, Kasper Asgreen, who remains the stage leader. Stefan Kung finishes: The Groupama-FDJ rider finishes fourth provisionally, despite crashing out on the course. Also out on the road,Movistar rider Nelson Oliveira has been quickest so far at the first two checkpoints. Riding his first tour de France, Belgian cyclocross sensation Wout van Aert has just rolled down the ramp. With a stage win under his belt already, the Jumbo-Visma rider could have a big say in the outcome of today\u2019s stage. He\u2019s the reigning Belgian national time trial champion, don\u2019t you know? An email: \u201cI guess I can see both sides to the argument with Simon Yates,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cHe\u2019s not a GC contender, and so he\u2019ll take it very easy today, like Tony Martin (however odd that feels). So it feels a bit more understandable. \u201cAnd obviously, it\u2019s the DS\u2019s call. Ineos locking down the peloton yesterday, as Thomas Atkins points out, probably made it more likely, too. Stages aren\u2019t fixed plans, so it\u2019ll evolve on the road. Plus Ineos must win the GC, but surely Michelton Scott have a few irons in the fire. It all makes for great racing, though.\u201d Asgreen still leads. With 30 riders already back in the clubhouse, the 24-year-old Dane\u2019s time of 35min 52sec remains the one to beat. Martin finishes: The German pedalling machine hasn\u2019t been trying today and finishes 5min 53sec off the pace set by Asgreen. Kasper Asgreen leads: 161st on GC this morning, Kasper Asgreen finishes the course in 35min 52sec before Chad can plant his backside in the chair traditionally occupied by the clubhouse leader. Asgreen, by contrast, mnight be sitting in it for a while - that\u2019s a good time. Both Haga and Asgreen started after Tony Martin, who is still out on the course. Yoann Offredo finishes the course: The lanterne rouge finishes the course in a time of 40min 10sec, but his time is quickly obliterated by Chad Haga of Team Sunweb, who completes the circuit in 36min 22sec. An email: \u201cI do wonder whether Team Ineos do a lot of work on behalf of the peloton, which enables other teams to be able to spread their resources a bit better,\u201d writes Thomas Atkins. |There only needs to be one team controlling the tempo, policing which breaks are allowed to go, and setting the speed of the peloton during the boring bits of the race. Michelton Scott probably don\u2019t need eight riders focusing solely on the GC race most of the time, which frees up the likes of Simon Yates to do their thing.\u201d A fair point, well made. It did not go unnoticed that Ineos had all eight of their riders at the front of the yellow jersey group in the closing stages yesterday. Mikel Landa is 20th on GC and is due to go out at 4.03pm, followed by the rest of the GC big hitters. While I\u2019m always grateful for the company, I won\u2019t be in the least bit offended if you decided to abandon me and come back then! In the meantime, Kasper Asgreen has been quickest through the first checkpoint so far, posting a time of 11min 50sec at 7.7km. The Deceuninck- Quick Step rider was also fastest through the second checkpoint in 22min 42sec. Tony Martin is caught by his minute-man: And now he\u2019s been caught by the guy who started two minutes after him. He\u2019s clearly not trying a leg today and has probably decided to take the day off in order to recover from all his exertions at the front of the bunch on this Tour. An email: \u201cI\u2019m a little baffled about the Mitchelton Scott tactics yesterday,\u201d writes Matt Emerson. \u201cAs a Vuelta winner Simon Yates is just about the best domestique you could have, so why let him waste energy on a stage win \u2013 he finished nine and a half minutes ahead of the GC riders, which must have been a big effort \u2013 when the Tourmalet is coming up in two days\u2019 time? I\u2019m pretty sure Ineos wouldn\u2019t have let him do that. Any ideas?\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure Ineos wouldn\u2019t have let him do it either, but then not all teams are as stupendously dull as The Artists Formerly Known As Sky. It seems very harsh to describe a stage win as a waste of energy, when winning stages brings so much prestige and is a very difficult thing to do. Unlike Ineos, Mitchelton Scott seem happy to give their leader\u2019s lieutenants the opportunity to win stages while simultaneously focussing on the GC standing of Adam Yates. It is a tactic that may not yield the ultimate dividend, but it\u2019s heartwarming to see and they\u2019ve done very well out of it so far. We have four checkpoints today: The first is at Ceriset at the 7.7km mark, the second is at Cote D\u2019Esquillot (15.5km), the third is at Juancon (21.9km) and the fourth and all important one is at the finish in Pau (27.2km). There are eight riders out on the road already. Our first four riders are away: Tony Martin has just set off and as a former world champion, will certainly be one to watch. He may not be as good as he used to be, but he\u2019ll fancy his chances to day and will almost certainly set a time to beat. In the early stages, however, he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going at full gas. 166 riders left: Rohan Dennis and Giacomo Nizzolo quite the Tour yesterday, one on the back of a hissy-fit and the other due to injuries sustained in a crash the previous day. Jasper Philipsen was also withdrawn by UAE Team Emirates, his employers having decided that half a Tour was enough for the 21-year-old Belgian. Currently in last place on GC, Yoann Offredo will be the first man down the ramp today and will set off in approximately five minutes. It\u2019s difficult to imagine he\u2019ll be too fussed about he gets on. Once he\u2019s set off, riders will go off at one-minute intervals. Mitchelton Scott\u2019s stage 12 diary It was another good day for the Australian team, who won their second stage of this year\u2019s Tour, when Simon Yates completed his set of Grand Tour stage wins. Matteo Trentin also took the combativity award and the team can now focus on trying to get Yates\u2019s twin brother Adam as high as possible up the General Classification. He is currently in 7th place, 1min 47sec behind Julian Alaphilippe. The curious abandonment of Rohan Dennis While passing through the feed zone yesterday, Rohan Dennis decided to dismount his bicycle and quit this year\u2019s Tour. Almost 24 hours later, mystery continues to surround the Australian\u2019s decision. The world ITT champion, Dennis was among the favourites for today\u2019s stage, but abandoned the Tour despite not being ill or injured. Although he was spotted near his team bus at the end of the stage, he refused to speak to reporters and his team were vague when asked about what happened too. \u201cWe actually expected a big effort from him tomorrow,\u201d said Bahrain-Merida sports director Gorazd Stangelj. \u201cIt was his decision today to stop in the feed zone. We tried to speak with him. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk\u2019 and just abandoned the race. His condition is not bad, he\u2019s good enough to perform at the Tour de France. For sure it has nothing to do with his condition.\u201d A notoriously spiky character, Dennis is rumoured to be unhappy with the Merida time trial bike he is obliged to use because of his team\u2019s sponsors. Speaking to Lance Armstrong\u2019s The Move podcast, former Radioshack and US Postal team director Johan Bruyneel, suggested there was also talk that Dennis spat the dummy because there was something wrong with the skin-suit he was due to wear today. It didn\u2019t fit, or hadn\u2019t turned up ... something like that. While Bruyneel\u2019s every utterance should be taken with several shovelfuls of salt, for obvious reasons, he is exceptionally well connected in the world of professional cycling, so there may well be more than a grain of truth to what he is saying. Tour de France With the ladies finished, it\u2019s time to return our focus to the gentlemen, who have their Race of Truth this afternoon. Marianne Vos and chums did five laps of the circuit they\u2019ll have to complete this afternoon. While this is ostensibly a day off for the majority of riders, it should go some way towards sorting out the men among the GC contenders from the boys. But first, a recap on stage three, which was won by Mitchelton Scott rider Simon Yates yesterday. Jeremy Whittle was there for the Guardian ... V for Victory (and Vos): Marianne Vos takes her second La Course, having won her first five years ago on different terrain. \u201cI feel really good, I came with good motivation from the Giro Rosa,\u201d she says, having won four stages in the Italian race. Heartbreak for Amanda Spratt as Marianne Vos sweeps past her on the final climb with just 300 metres to go, pulls away from her and wins at her leisure to CCC Live. 500m to go: Spratt hits the ramp near the finish, but is passed by Marianne Vos. 1km to go: Spratt gets out of the saddle again, while Trek Segafredo go to the front of the bunch. 2.0km to go: Spratt ploughs on, her face a mask of pain. The peloton can see her ... 2.5km to go: Spratt leads by 12 seconds. At the front of the bunch, CCC Liv and Team Sunweb finally appear to have got their act together and are hunting her down. 6km to go: Hats off to Annemiek van Vleuten, Spratt\u2019s team-mate, who is successfully disrupting any efforts the bunch are making to get themselves organised. At the moment, Riejanne Markus of CCC-Liv is trying to tow them along to get her team-mate Vos into contention. 7km to go: The gap from Amanda Spratt to the chasing posse goes back out to 33 seconds, then back into 19. Can she hang on? 7.5km to go: Spratt is out of the saddle, her legs pumping . The gap is back out to 20 seconds in the wake of the aforementioned indecision and disorganisation in the pack, where the riders are squabbling over how best to organise their chase. 10km to go: Some indecision in the peloton, where Van Vleuten is policing the bunch on behalf her Aussie teammate up the road. 11km to go: The peloton has Spratt in their sights, her lead now down to just nine seconds. 12km to go: It\u2019s worth noting that Spratt\u2019s Dutch team-mate, Annemiek van Vleuten is trying to win her third consecutive La Course title. She is currently chasing down Lucinda Brand and Marianne Vos, who are trying to bridge the gap from the peloton to Spratt. The gap is dissolving, however. 16km to go: Marianne Vos and her CCC Liv domestiques are towing the bunch along as Spratt, who was previously in a five-woman breakaway before dropping her travelling companions and striking for home on her own. La Course: You join us with 17 kilometres left of this year\u2019s La Course, a race in which Annemiek van Vleuten, Anna van der Breggen, Marianne Vos and Lizzie Deignan are among the field of big-name cyclists riding five laps of the Individual Time Trial course their male counterparts will tackle in the Individual Time Trial later this afternoon. Described today by the Dame Sarah Storey as \u201ca token gesture\u201d even if \u201cit\u2019s better to have any race than no race\u201d, this year\u2019s La Course is currently being led by Mitchelton Scott rider Amanda Spratt, who has a lead of 28 seconds over the chasing pack. William Fotheringham: \u201cAt least one or two of the favourites who are weaker time triallists should be effectively put out of the reckoning.",

Although Damian Hinds declined to put a figure on the announcement to be made as early as next week, he said discussions between the Department for Education and the Treasury recognised the \u201cparticular pressures\u201d caused by the rapid increase in children and young people with Send. The news will be welcomed by campaigners, and local authorities that have borne the brunt of the additional support required and have struggled to meet rising costs. Hinds said increased resources should include more capital funding for special schools and other specialist facilities, following revelations that local authorities have been forced to spend millions on private provision. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this work with the Treasury, I\u2019m not going to comment on a particular number, but we\u2019ve done the work to analyse what the pressures are in the system and both how we should and must respond to those pressures in terms of cash,\u201d Hinds told the Guardian. \u201cThere is also how we can help to relieve some of the cash pressures by making sure we have the right provision, that there aren\u2019t blockages in the system, that children aren\u2019t having to go into the wrong type of provision.

Hinds said the pressures on local authorities and schools have been emerging since the government\u2019s 2014 reforms, which mandated support for children with education and health care plans (EHCP) and raised the age for support from 19 to 25. \u201cLocal authorities need to make sure there is the right setting for every child to help them develop to their fullest potential.

      "bodyText": "A self-styled yellow vest activist has admitted harassing the remain-supporting MP Anna Soubry and racially abusing a police officer in a last-minute change of plea in court. James Goddard, a 30-year-old pro-Brexit protester, filmed himself hurling abuse at the former Conservative MP and called her a Nazi after claiming she was a \u201ctraitor\u201d for betraying the country\u2019s vote to leave the EU in 2016. He had previously denied one charge of intent to cause Soubry harassment, alarm or distress, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour and one count of using racially aggravated behaviour towards PC Mindaugas Sciukas. But at Westminster magistrates court on Friday, Goddard, of Timperley in Altrincham, changed his pleas to guilty. His co-defendant, Brian Phillips, 55, of Erith in south-east London, also changed his plea to guilty on a charge of harassment without violence. Paul Jarvis, prosecuting, described how Soubry \u2013 now a member of the Independent Group for Change after defecting in February \u2013 was \u201cvery shaken\u201d by what happened after a television interview she was giving on 7 January 2019 was interrupted by shouts from protesters. She was surrounded by Goddard, Phillips and others as she made her way to the Palace of Westminster, footage played in court showed. Jarvis said: \u201cShe found being described as a Nazi deeply offensive. It left her feeling angry.\u201d In her victim impact statement, small sections of which were read in court, Soubry said: \u201cI was really intimidated, and I was very shaken by what happened, however I couldn\u2019t show it on camera. I have developed a mechanism for cutting off large parts of my emotions.\u201d The guilty plea followed a truncated and occasionally chaotic session in court. Goddard, who gesticulated throughout the case, stood up to address the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, as the hearing concluded, telling her he too had suffered following the actions of Soubry, stating he had not been violent and had not thrown a milkshake like other protesters, and added that he had also lost access to his daughter. He was told he would have a proper chance to address the magistrates before his sentencing on Monday. Soubry had been expected to give evidence in person during the hearing. In a statement following the case, Soubry said: \u201cI am pleased that both defendants have pleaded guilty to two public order offences and in relation to Goddard the additional offence of racially aggravated abuse of a police officer. \u201cThey have admitted these crimes and accepted that their behaviour on two occasions outside parliament was wrong and unjustified. Everyone is entitled to go about their lawful business. \u201cIn a democracy, people have a right to peaceful, lawful protest. No one has the right to intimidate and abuse anyone. I am particularly pleased justice has been done in relation to the police officer. Racist abuse is deplorable and should never be tolerated.\u201d Goddard, shouted and chanted at Soubry, pursued her, filmed her, called her \u201cscum\u201d, \u201cNazi\u201d and \u201ctraitor\u201d, and used other insulting language. At a chaotic previous hearing Goddard repeatedly gesticulated to supporters in the gallery who chanted \u201cshame on you\u201d at the judge. Goddard has previously argued that all Muslims should be removed from the UK, saying he wanted to \u201cban Islam from the west\u201d. A video emerged earlier this year of Goddard arguing that Islam should be removed from the UK. He built up his profile by live-streaming confrontations to Facebook and seeking donations to finance his actions. His Facebook and Paypal pages were removed following calls from the Speaker, John Bercow, and more than 100 MPs for a stronger response from the police and technology companies. Goddard had previously posted anti-Islam statements on Gab, a social media site popular with the far right, and has supported Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, the founder of the English Defence League street movement.",

      "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s government will pay nearly C$1bn ($770m) to members of the military who took part in class-action lawsuits alleging widespread sexual misconduct. \u201cNo one should feel unsafe in their place of work, in their communities,\u201d Justin Trudeau told reporters on Thursday, according to the CBC. \u201cThere was a lot of negotiation and discussion with both the people concerned and their representatives and we were pleased that we got a settlement that was acceptable to the people involved,\u201d the prime minister said. According to a statement, the government does not admit liability. Under the terms of the agreement, the federal government set aside C$900m ($690m), of which C$800m ($612m) will be payable to current and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces. The remaining C$100m ($77m) is pegged to members of the Department of National Defence. A 2016 survey found that 27% of women in the armed forces had been sexually assaulted during their career, while members of the military were twice as likely to be sexually assaulted as the general population of working Canadians. Eligible members of these institutions will be able to apply for between C$5,000 ($3,826) and C$55,000 ($42,090) in compensation. Members who experienced \u201cexceptional harm\u201d and those who previously applied for and were denied benefits from Veterans Affairs Canada in relation to their claim may receive as much as C$155,000 ($118,600). Besides the payment, participants will also be able to take part in a \u201cRestorative Engagement Program\u201d, according to the settlement. In the program, they will be able to tell senior members of the military about their experiences and have them taken into account as the military tries to change its culture. Amy Graham, the primary plaintiff in one of the lawsuits, told the Toronto Star that she hopes the restorative justice program will help with \u201cgetting some real change to decrease the amount of victims\u201d. But the culture of the military is \u201cingrained\u201d, she said, and will take time to change. The lawsuits and the attendant reckoning within the military have been playing out for years. In December 2017, lawyers for the government argued that the government does not \u201cowe a private law duty of care to members within the CAF to provide a safe and harassment-free work environment, or to create policies to prevent sexual harassment or sexual assault\u201d. Asked about the statements not long after, Trudeau said they were \u201cof concern\u201d and the government began settlement proceedings in early 2018.",

The departures of playoff star Jimmy Butler and reliable sharpshooter JJ Redick will be felt (and somewhat alleviated by the addition of Josh Richardson), but it seems the much-ballyhooed Process rebuild is well into the endgame with the locked-down core of Joel Embiid (under contract through 2023), Ben Simmons (through 2025), Tobias Harris (through 2024) and free-agent signee Al Horford (through 2023). Depth remains a question which supporters hope the development of youngsters Zhaire Smith and Matisse Thybulle can address, but the mouth-watering talent and length of the starting five make these Sixers trendy favorites to reach the NBA finals for the first time since 2001.

The latter came at a high price in a blockbuster trade, costing them Danilo Gallinari, the underrated Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and no fewer than five first-round picks, but it\u2019s hard to imagine anything but a major injury derailing this deep group who pushed the then-healthy Warriors to the limit in last year\u2019s playoffs. A supporting cast including the re-signed Patrick Beverley, JaMychal Green and Ivica Zubac, and second-unit combo Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, promises to give opposing teams fits all season.

Given his pedigree it would be no surprise if something suddenly clicked and the 29-year-old American got on another major roll.</p> \n<p>This week Koepka\u2019s coach, Pete Cowen, insisted his man had gone from being Mr Angry to being \u201cthe calmest guy in a major \u2013 what used to be his weakness is now a strength\u201d \u2013 but there was no disguising his frustration about being able to hit only three birdies amid the calmest conditions of the tournament.</p> \n<p>On Thursday Koepka had shot a 68 despite claiming he \u201cfelt like the world was going to end\u201d because of the driving rain and scudding winds. Yet on the sedatest of coastal mornings he could not make it count.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"39991b5b-3e14-4af9-a33a-31351d6b5693\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XEWc54ZtNRM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>An early birdie on the par-five 2nd was quickly handed back with a bogey on the 4th and he then hit eight straight pars \u2013 including several near misses \u2013 before finally making back-to-back birdies on the 12th and 13th.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday was a lot easier,\u201d he admitted \u201cI definitely feel like I could have shot a low one. Where the pin locations were and where the wind direction was coming from, there was quite a few gettable holes such as six and seven. 17 was also a good chance and I found a way to screw that up. It was frustrating but at the same time if I play a good weekend I\u2019ll be in good shape. I\u2019m close enough to make a run.\u201d</p> \n<p>The bookies agree. On Friday afternoon, as the weather began to close in, the bookies made him one of the favourites despite being three shots behind the clubhouse leaders, JB Holmes and Shane Lowry. However, when Koepka was asked whether he would prefer to lead at this stage there was a flash of anger. \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather be in last place,\u201d he said, snarkily, before softening his attitude. \u201cI\u2019d like to have as many shot lead as possible. You never know when you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps that flash of anger was no bad thing given that Koepka seems to play so much better when he has a gigantic chip on his shoulder. When ESPN\u2019s magazine ignored Koepka in their 20 most dominant athletes of 2018 despite him winning two majors \u2013 in favour of the horse Justify, who won the triple crown \u2013 he was so annoyed he made the picture as his lock screen on his phone so he would be angry all over again when he woke up each day.</p> \n<p>Koepka also took umbrage when Fox Sport did not use him in one of its four trailers for this year\u2019s US Open given he was defending champion \u2013 even though he was heavily featured in the other three. That time it fired him into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/17/woodland-holds-off-rose-and-koepka-to-win-us-open\" title=\"\">second place at Pebble Beach</a>.</p> \n<p>It is a measure of his overall game that Koepka is still in contention despite making one long putt in two rounds \u2013 on the 13th \u2013 but the American still sees other things he needs to work on. \u201cOn the front nine I didn\u2019t hit it as good as I\u2019d like,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t pitch it as good. It\u2019s tough to really score if you\u2019re going to do that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/19/lee-westwood-caddie-girlfriend\">Lee Westwood\u2019s girlfriend and caddie Helen Storey proves a major boost</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, he is confident he can turn things around, particularly with his caddie Rickie Elliot \u2013 who is from Portrush \u2013 guiding him around. \u201cHe knows exactly where to put it and tells me where to go and I fire it there,\u201d he said smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have to think much. I don\u2019t have to do anything. Obviously he knows this golf course like the back of his hand.\u201d</p> \n<p>When it was put to Koepka that he had a similar home-court advantage as in basketball, he nodded. \u201cSure. Obviously the knowledge of the course and the knowledge that he knows exactly where to put it, where the misses are, that\u2019s a big advantage. Playing so many rounds around here it\u2019s definitely helped a shot or two.\u201d</p> \n<p>And that, he believes, could make all the difference come Sundaynight. \u201cI\u2019m hanging around,\u201d he said. \u201cJust close enough. It\u2019s not where I want to be but it\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll figure it out this weekend.\u201d Just like he has so many times in the past. Would you dare bet against him?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brooks Koepka has barely made a putt at this year\u2019s Open. Yet he has continued to linger at the top of the leaderboard as if by stealth. A steady 69 on Friday left him at five under and within three shots of the leaders going into the business end of this championship. And his demeanour afterwards suggested he believes a fifth major in 10 starts is there for the taking if he starts getting the rub of the green. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a putt all week,\u201d he said. \u201cI just need to figure that out. I could very easily be 10 under and really maybe more. I feel like sometimes the putts haven\u2019t gone in and other times they\u2019re terrible putts.\u201d On Friday afternoon he cut a solitary figure on the putting green, greasing that familiar groove, trying to turn the half dozen putts that flirted with the hole into third-round birdies on Saturday. Given his pedigree it would be no surprise if something suddenly clicked and the 29-year-old American got on another major roll. This week Koepka\u2019s coach, Pete Cowen, insisted his man had gone from being Mr Angry to being \u201cthe calmest guy in a major \u2013 what used to be his weakness is now a strength\u201d \u2013 but there was no disguising his frustration about being able to hit only three birdies amid the calmest conditions of the tournament. On Thursday Koepka had shot a 68 despite claiming he \u201cfelt like the world was going to end\u201d because of the driving rain and scudding winds. Yet on the sedatest of coastal mornings he could not make it count. An early birdie on the par-five 2nd was quickly handed back with a bogey on the 4th and he then hit eight straight pars \u2013 including several near misses \u2013 before finally making back-to-back birdies on the 12th and 13th. \u201cToday was a lot easier,\u201d he admitted \u201cI definitely feel like I could have shot a low one. Where the pin locations were and where the wind direction was coming from, there was quite a few gettable holes such as six and seven. 17 was also a good chance and I found a way to screw that up. It was frustrating but at the same time if I play a good weekend I\u2019ll be in good shape. I\u2019m close enough to make a run.\u201d The bookies agree. On Friday afternoon, as the weather began to close in, the bookies made him one of the favourites despite being three shots behind the clubhouse leaders, JB Holmes and Shane Lowry. However, when Koepka was asked whether he would prefer to lead at this stage there was a flash of anger. \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather be in last place,\u201d he said, snarkily, before softening his attitude. \u201cI\u2019d like to have as many shot lead as possible. You never know when you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d Perhaps that flash of anger was no bad thing given that Koepka seems to play so much better when he has a gigantic chip on his shoulder. When ESPN\u2019s magazine ignored Koepka in their 20 most dominant athletes of 2018 despite him winning two majors \u2013 in favour of the horse Justify, who won the triple crown \u2013 he was so annoyed he made the picture as his lock screen on his phone so he would be angry all over again when he woke up each day. Koepka also took umbrage when Fox Sport did not use him in one of its four trailers for this year\u2019s US Open given he was defending champion \u2013 even though he was heavily featured in the other three. That time it fired him into second place at Pebble Beach. It is a measure of his overall game that Koepka is still in contention despite making one long putt in two rounds \u2013 on the 13th \u2013 but the American still sees other things he needs to work on. \u201cOn the front nine I didn\u2019t hit it as good as I\u2019d like,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t pitch it as good. It\u2019s tough to really score if you\u2019re going to do that.\u201d However, he is confident he can turn things around, particularly with his caddie Rickie Elliot \u2013 who is from Portrush \u2013 guiding him around. \u201cHe knows exactly where to put it and tells me where to go and I fire it there,\u201d he said smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have to think much. I don\u2019t have to do anything. Obviously he knows this golf course like the back of his hand.\u201d When it was put to Koepka that he had a similar home-court advantage as in basketball, he nodded. \u201cSure. Obviously the knowledge of the course and the knowledge that he knows exactly where to put it, where the misses are, that\u2019s a big advantage. Playing so many rounds around here it\u2019s definitely helped a shot or two.\u201d And that, he believes, could make all the difference come Sundaynight. \u201cI\u2019m hanging around,\u201d he said. \u201cJust close enough. It\u2019s not where I want to be but it\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll figure it out this weekend.\u201d Just like he has so many times in the past. Would you dare bet against him?",

      "bodyText": "Israeli aircraft spraying herbicide beside the buffer zone along the Gaza strip is directly affecting the livelihoods of Palestinians in violation of international standards, a new report claims. The study tracked the drift of the herbicides on to the Gazan side and concluded it was killing agricultural crops and causing \u201cunpredictable and uncontrollable damage\u201d, according to the report\u2019s main researcher. The report also concluded the spray is reaching more than 300 metres (980ft) into Gaza. The work was undertaken by Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at Goldsmiths, University of London, which spent 16 months investigating the potential effects of the spraying. The report\u2019s lead researcher said that in the last five years Israeli planes have sprayed herbicide more than 30 times on the Israeli side of the buffer zone with Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, designated a terror group by the European Union. The Israeli Ministry of Defense told the Guardian the spraying is necessary for security reasons, is \u201cconducted only over the territory of the State of Israel\u201d and is supervised by certified professionals. \u201cThe defence establishment conducts weed control in which the material is sprayed from the air for operational purposes, among them removing potential cover for terror elements, which may threaten the citizens of the State of Israel, particularly the communities living adjacent to the Gaza border, as well as [Israel Defense Forces] troops,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Farmers living and working in these areas, however, have long claimed that their crops and livelihoods suffer as a result. Using a video taken by Gisha, a Tel Aviv-based freedom of movement NGO, Forensic Architecture reconstructed the drift of the herbicide from a plane with the help of a fluid dynamics expert. It also analysed leaf samples, interviewed farmers and used satellite imagery to map the effects of the spraying. The resulting video report will be presented on Sunday, 21 July in Ramallah. It says harmful concentrations of the spray that surpass EU standards landed in areas where farmers had recorded damage in the past. \u201cIf you generalise this single spraying event in Khan Yunis on April 5th [2017] to the rest of the border you see something very similar,\u201d said the researcher, who requested anonymity to protect their access. \u201cYou see that there\u2019s a protracted and continuous loss of greenness along the border that has over time flattened it and that isn\u2019t recovering. It\u2019s a piece of land that through bombings and the bulldozings and twice-a-year herbicidal spraying is becoming a barren and scorched dead zone.\u201d Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2007 when Hamas seized control of the coastal enclave and Israel and Egypt imposed a land and sea blockade. Previous reports by the Israeli website +972 and Haaretz newspaper, along with freedom of information requests from Gisha, have unearthed similar findings about damage to the land on the Gazan side. The Forensic Architecture report provides further confirmation that the herbicide spraying has caused \u201cunpredictable and uncontrollable damage\u201d on the Gaza side, according to their researcher. \u201cWhat was so significant from the Forensic Architecture [report] was that they show that the main effect of the spraying is inside of Gaza,\u201d said Muna Haddad, an advocate with Gisha. Gisha, along with Adalah, a Palestinian rights group based in Haifa, and Al Mezan , a Gaza-based human rights group, have petitioned the Israeli military for compensation for farmers in Gaza who say they have lost crops due to the spraying. Israeli authorities have rejected the petition. However, they did provide compensation to an Israeli agricultural town, Nahal Oz, near the buffer zone in 2015, after farmers sued because they lost crops after a spraying. The Israeli Ministry of Defense did not respond to a specific question regarding wind direction, but said that the spraying is certified by professionals. \u201cIt is carried out by companies specialised in the field, in accordance with the law,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe materials have been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, and are used in agricultural fields across Israel, as well as by other countries. The process is conducted and supervised by certified professionals.\u201d This spring was the first time in five years that Israeli Defense Forces did not spray the border area and farmers in the affected areas reported better farming conditions, according to human rights groups. Gisha, along with Adalah and Al Mezan, said that if and when the next spraying occurs, they will use Forensic Architecture\u2019s findings to petition Israel to stop the practice or to mitigate the damage, such as providing compensation or advance notice so that farmers can cover their crops. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough that you [the Israeli military] claim that the spraying is inside Israel,\u201d said Haddad. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t take any measures that harm the basic needs and health and life of people there.\u201d",

Nonetheless, Iran has made it clear in recent weeks that it rejects any Western presence in the Strait of Hormuz--officials warned the UK to withdraw its ships from the region earlier this month, saying that it could ensure regional security alone. The latest skirmish with the US is likely to put Iran even more on guard. </p> <p>We still do not expect either party to willingly enter into open conflict; Iran is ill equipped to wage an expensive conflict, and doing so would probably alienate its remaining allies in Europe. The US government will not want to start a deeply unpopular foreign conflict just as the campaign season ramps up for 2020.

      "bodyText": "A quick recap Britain\u2019s budget deficit has widened, giving Britain\u2019s next prime minister a headache before they even get to work. The UK had to borrow \u00a37.2bn in June to cover the gap between spending and tax receipts, more than expected and more than twice as much as in June 2018. Economists fear that Britain could miss its borrowing targets for the current financial year. Donald Trump has renewed the pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this month. The US president blasted \u2018faulty\u2019 thinking at the Fed, and urged it to cut borrowing costs. Hopes of an imminent US rate cut helped to drive the gold price to a six-year high today. An ounce of bullion hit $1,450 for the first time since 2013, with rising tensions in the Middle East also boosting demand for the metal. Motoring groups have warned that UK drivers face an expensive summer, after petrol prices hit their highest for any July in five years. Stocks have fallen in Italy, on fears that Rome\u2019s government could be on the brink of collapse. US consumers don\u2019t appear to share Donald Trump\u2019s concerns about interest rates. The University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey of consumer sentiment has shown a small increase, to 98.4 from 98.2 last month. That\u2019s close to a 10-year high. Americans reported that they were more optimistic about their financial prospects -- perhaps thanks to recent stock market gains, and hopes of a US-China trade war deal. What does Donald Trump mean when he says he preferred New York Fed President John Williams\u2019 \u201cfirst statement much better than his second\u201d? Well, Williams caused excitement yesterday when he outlined the virtue of pro-active, early, interest rate cuts - rather than waiting for problems to develop. By comparing a rate cut to a vaccination jab sparked excitement among investors, and speculation that he could be backing a large cut to borrowing costs. But this prompted the New York Fed to issue a clarification to its leaders\u2019 speech, insisting that he wasn\u2019t trying to guide the market (to Trump\u2019s obvious disappointment). They said: \u201cThis was an academic speech on 20 years of research. It was not about potential policy actions at the upcoming FOMC meeting.\u201d Another day, another attack on the US central bank from the White House. Central bank independence looks ancient history, as president Trump argues that US interest rates should be a LOT lower. Retail news: a private equity firm has bought a controlling stake in department store Liberty London, in a deal valuing the landmark at \u00a3300m. More here: We mentioned this morning that gold has hit a six-year high, but it\u2019s actually an EIGHT year high once you priced it in sterling rather than dollars. That\u2019s because of the pound\u2019s recent weakness following the EU referendum. Adrian Ash, director of research at online and mobile-app trading platform BullionVault, explains: \u201cRising debt and falling interest rates are conspiring with the UK\u2019s Brexit mess to push down Sterling as gold sets multi-year highs. \u201cThe last and only other time gold traded this high for UK savers was summer 2011, when the global financial crisis peaked with the near-collapse of the Euro and the worst rioting across England in modern times.\u201d Shares in Microsoft have hit a record high, after it reported strong revenue growth from cloud computing services and its Surface laptop business. Over in New York, stocks are rising at the start of trading as investors anticipate US interest rate cuts soon. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 110 points, or 0.4%, to 27,333, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.35% to 3,005 -- close to this week\u2019s record highs. St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard has boosted stocks, by saying that a 0.25% cut in US interest rates this month would be appropriate. As if the weak pound was enough trouble, families are also facing higher petrol costs . The AA reports that fuel prices hit 128.72p a litre in July, while diesel cost 131.61p on average. That\u2019s the highest for any July in five years. That will drive up the cost of a UK staycation, if people face a long drive to and from their summer getaway. Infuriatingly for drivers, wholesale energy costs have actually fallen over the last few months. Brent crude was $75/barrel in April, but just $63/barrel this week. However, import costs have risen, due to the pound hitting a 27-month low against the US dollar. The AA\u2019s Luke Bosdet says: \u201cThe tragedy with soaring summer pump prices is not only hard-earned holidaymakers\u2019 money disappearing at the pump but the loss of income for the tourism industry. \u201cIf every car that heads to the South West, Wales, the Lake District, Scotland or other UK holiday destinations pays an extra \u00a37 a tank for fuel compared to two years ago, that is many millions of pounds not being spent in places where a good tourist season is make or break for those communities.\u201d On the other hand, climate activists might welcome anything that keeps cars off the road - or encourages a move to electric. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says June\u2019s public finances in June show the scale of the challenge facing Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt: Pledges by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to cut taxes and increase spending have come just as the UK\u2019s public finances have shown a marked deterioration, according to the latest official figures. In what analysts called a \u201creality check\u201d for the two Conservative prime ministerial contenders, the Office for National Statistics said the government needed to borrow \u00a37.2bn last month \u2013 more than double the \u00a33.3bn in the same month a year ago. Higher spending and lower tax receipts were responsible for the highest June deficit \u2013 the gap between government income and spending \u2013 in four years, amid signs that the economic slowdown is starting to feed through into the public finances. Hunt and Johnson have promised big cuts in corporate and personal taxes while campaigning to succeed Theresa May, prompting a warning from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility on Thursday that there was no fiscal \u201cfree lunch\u201d. The OBR warned that the contenders\u2019 proposals were uncosted and would be likely to raise government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds. More here: 2019 has been a strong year for stock markets so far, with Wall Street up 20%, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gaining 11% and China\u2019s CSI 300 rallying by 17%. But we\u2019re now entering the summer lull, and analysts are wondering if a correction is close. Mike Wilson, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley, believes stocks could soon shed 10% of their value in the next few months, telling Marketwatch: \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for the bottom to fallout like last year, but I do expect a 10% correction in the next three months,\u201d He argues that earnings estimates are too frothy, and may come down over the summer - very plausible, if the world economy loses momentum. It also appears that a US interest rate cut is rather \u2018priced in\u2019 to valuations, so traders could take profits when it actually happens. Wilson says: \u201cWe think there\u2019s still some unfinished business and it\u2019s not going to be scary, but it will be a better opportunity to buy stocks over the next three to six months, and maybe 18 months. We tell people don\u2019t chase break outs when everyone is getting excited.\u201d Over in Milan, stocks are sliding as investor worry that Italy\u2019s coalition government could collapse. Tensions have been growing for weeks between the right-wing League party, and the anti-establishment Movement Five Star. Now, League leader Matteo Salvini (Italy\u2019s deputy PM) has criticised his coalition partners, revealing he will meet M5S\u2019s Luigi Di Maio soon. Salvini is unhappy that M5S are blocking certain government policies, saying: \u201cWe will certainly meet ... the problem is not Di Maio, but opposition coming from many 5-Star politicians. \u201cThere is an obvious and total block on proposals, initiatives, projects and infrastructure by some 5-Star ministers that hurts Italy. Salvini\u2019s attacks on migration, and his decision to block migrant rescue ships from docking at Italian ports, have also angered M5S politicians. Opinions poll show that the League are leading the polls -- which might encourage Salvani to push for an election.... Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost 1% today, with bank shares down 2.5%. Here\u2019s our news story on how gold had been boosted by tensions in the Gulf, and the prospect of interest rate cuts: The jump in UK borrowing casts a shadow over the coronation of the next Conservative Party leader next week. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says the swelling deficit is \u201chardly the best backdrop\u201d to the race to Downing Street. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have made expensive pledges in their battle for votes (which chancellor Philip Hammond say are impossible under a no-deal Brexit....) He says: Disappointing news on the public finances to greet the new Prime Minister and Chancellor when they shortly take office with the June shortfall on the budget deficit more than doubling year-on-year. Furthermore June meant that the public finances have seen year-on-year deterioration through the first three months of fiscal year 2019/20. Archer adds that it\u2019s too early to say definitively whether the UK will hit, or miss, it\u2019s budget target this year. Much will depend on whether the economy can shrug off its current weakness as well as on Brexit developments. It will also be influenced by any changes to fiscal policy by the new Prime Minister and Chancellor. Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward points out that the cost of servicing Britain\u2019s national debt rose in June -- helping to push the deficit higher. Spending including capital investment rose 7.2%, boosted by debt interest costs -- higher RPI pushed up payments on inflation-linked bonds -- and government outlays on goods and services. Receipts rose 1.5%, with dividends and national-insurance contributions driving the increase. Excluding these categories, tax income was virtually unchanged. A no-deal Brexit crisis would make the UK public finances look even worse, points out Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC: There remains an unusual amount of uncertainty around the short-term future of the public finances at present. A no-deal Brexit would hit both government revenue (through lower tax receipts) and expenditure (through the need for fiscal stimulus package). The government would be likely to have to reconsider its medium-term targets for the deficit and debt. But even if a no-deal Brexit is avoided, a new chancellor is likely to bring new priorities and, with a spending review on the horizon, could sanction a period of looser fiscal policy.\u201d Britain\u2019s public finances appear to be \u2018heading off track\u2019, warns Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics. She says the jump in borrowing last month, from \u00a33.3bn to \u00a37.2nbn, shows that Britain is set to miss its borrowing targets for the 2019-20 financial. That will leave Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt with less wriggle-room to fund some of their campaign promises, such as tax cuts or public sector pay increases -- unless they rip up the government\u2019s borrowing targets. Gregory explains: June\u2019s public finance figures continued the underlying deterioration in the fiscal position evident since the beginning of the financial year, providing a timely reminder that the new PM won\u2019t get a free \u201cfiscal lunch\u201d.... There will be further bad news for the new PM in September as a change in the accounting treatment of student loans in September will raise the deficit by more than \u00a310bn a year. However, this might not stop the new PM from loosening fiscal policy, she adds. Economist Rupert Seggins shows how government spending has outpaced the tax take this financial year: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, is concerned that Britain\u2019s deficit is going up.... \u201cWith the Conservatives obsessed with No Deal Brexit and a race to the bottom on taxes, the outlook for our public services after years of austerity is grim. \u201cInstead of investing to grow they have passed on the deficit to hospitals and local councils, overseeing stagnating wages and productivity. \u201cOnly a Labour Government will deliver the radical transformation that is desperately needed to boost living standards and eliminate in-work poverty.\u201d June\u2019s budget deficit figures are much worst than expected, points out Helia Ebrahimi of Channel 4. The rising deficit may limit the next prime minister\u2019s ability to deliver tax cuts or spending increases, unless they\u2019re happy to drive borrowing higher. The surge in borrowing in June suggests Britain could miss its borrowing targets this financial year. The UK was expected to borrow \u00a329.3bn in the 2019-20 financial year, up from \u00a323.5bn in the 12 months to March. Just three months into the financial year, and Britain has already borrowed \u00a317.9bn, compared with \u00a313.5bn at this stage a year ago. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s budget deficit is rising faster than planned, after the government was forced to borrow more than seven billion pounds last month to balance the books. That\u2019s the largest deficit for a June in four years, and suggests that the UK\u2019s fiscal position may be weakening ahead of the Brexit vote. The increase in borrowing was driven by a large jump in public spending. Total central government expenditure rose by \u00a34.3bn compared with a year ago, while government income (ie from tax receipts) only rose by \u00a3800m. That lifted the deficit by \u00a33.8bn, from \u00a33.2bn in 2018 to \u00a37.2bn in June 2019. The Office for National Statistics reports: Borrowing (public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks) in June 2019 was \u00a37.2 billion, \u00a33.8 billion more than in June 2018; the highest June borrowing since 2015. Borrowing in the current financial year-to-date (April 2019 to June 2019) was \u00a317.9 billion, \u00a34.5 billion more than in the same period last year; the financial year-to-date April 2018 to June 2018 remains the lowest borrowing for that period since 2007. More to follow.... Iran insists that America has not shot down one of its drones... and is now suggesting that US forces could have downed one of their own! The deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, tweeted that he was \u201cworried\u201d that the USS Boxer had accidentally hit one of its own side\u2019s unmanned aerial systems (UAS). This has taken some of the heat out of the gold price, which has dipped back to $1,440 per ounce. The oil price has jumped 1% today, after America claimed to have shot down an Iranian drone. Brent crude has risen to $62.645 per barrel, reversing several day of losses, as investors brace for more skirmishes in the Gulf region. Cailin Birch, Global analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, says they\u2019re right to worry: \u201cReports that the US brought down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz will escalate tensions even further. Iranian officials have thus far taken care not to react to the incident in a way that provoke further conflict; officials\u2019 immediate response was to deny that any Iranian aircraft had been lost. Nonetheless, Iran has made it clear in recent weeks that it rejects any Western presence in the Strait of Hormuz--officials warned the UK to withdraw its ships from the region earlier this month, saying that it could ensure regional security alone. The latest skirmish with the US is likely to put Iran even more on guard. We still do not expect either party to willingly enter into open conflict; Iran is ill equipped to wage an expensive conflict, and doing so would probably alienate its remaining allies in Europe. The US government will not want to start a deeply unpopular foreign conflict just as the campaign season ramps up for 2020. However, the risk of a policy miscalculation remains high in this heated environment, meaning that more skirmishes are likely in the coming weeks.\u201d Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has fuelled the gold boom this week, arguing that investors should pile into the precious metal. In a blogpost, Dalio argued that gold was a sensible asset to invest in, as geopolitical tensions are rising and central bankers are likely to ease monetary policy to ward off a slowdown. He wrote: \u201cThose [investments] that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold. Dalio also pointed to the slump in government bond yields, as investors have piled into safe-haven assets such as German debt: I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one\u2019s portfolio.\u201d Gold struck its all-time high back in 2011, after the financial crisis, when it peaked over $1,900. We\u2019re nowhere near those levels yet, but Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, suspects bullion will keep rising through 2019. He cites the weakening US dollar (which pushes up commodity prices) and the fact that bonds provide so little income at present. The underlying trend is bullish for gold and silver, due to the falling government bond yields and the recent struggles for the dollar and stocks. So, as things stand, these are good times for buck-denominated and noninterest-bearing precious metals. Stock markets are taking a cue from gold this morning, with gains across the globe. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has jumped 2%, and China\u2019s CSI 300 index gained 1%, on hope of a US interest rate cut soon. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 48 points, or 0.6%, to 7,543. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Gold, that perennial barometer of investor nervousness, has hit a six-year high today. Bullion jumped through $1,450 per ounce for the first time since May 2013, extending its recent gains. This means gold has now surged by 25% since last August, a sparkling run that outpaces most other assets. The rally is being driven by several factors. One is that America\u2019s central bank seems certain to cut interest rates later this month. That would be inflationary -- and gold is seen as a store of value in such times. There\u2019s even chatter that the Federal Reserve could slash borrowing costs by half a percentage point, rather than the typical quarter-point cut. John Williams, the vice chairman of the Fed\u2019s policy-setting board, raised these rate cut hopes on Thursday when he said policymakers need to be pro-active, rather than waiting for a disaster to unfold. Comparing monetary policy to vaccination, Williams said: It\u2019s better to deal with the short-term pain of a shot than to take the risk that they\u2019ll contract a disease later on.\u201d Gold\u2019s popularity also comes as government bond prices surge to record highs. Many are now trading with negative yields, meaning investors are guaranteed to lose money if they hold the debt until it matures. Gold doesn\u2019t pay a dividend or a coupon, but can still deliver a profit if prices keep rising. Gold is also popular when geopolitical tensions escalate. The news that America says it has shot down an Iranian drone over the Strait of Hormuz yesterday (which Tehran denies) has worried investors, given recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf region. Nicholas Frappell, global general manager at ABC Bullion, says gold was further lifted by Iran announcing the capture of a foreign oil-smuggling tanker in the Gulf: \u201cThe extra push for gold prices came from comments by NY Fed President John Williams which implied quite aggressive rate-cutting, plus the Iranian drone news and the seizure of a tanker by the Iranians in the Straits of Hormuz.\u201d More to follow...

While many were outraged, Colbert compared Trump to \u201ca creature of pure energy in Star Trek \u2013 our horror only makes him stronger\u201d before playing footage of Trump angrily saying he\u2019s unable to remember all three of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s names. Colbert joked that he\u2019d rather stick with his friends: Mohammed bin Salman, Kim Jong-un and KFC. Colbert added: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but these rallies where a nationalist leader whips people up into a racist frenzy might have a dark side.\u201d Trump has tried to distance himself from the chant.

Ireland\u2019s fraught, twisting odyssey to Lord\u2019s contains an additional, tacit riposte to divisive rhetoric because it ends with an embrace of outsiders. Cricket was hugely popular in the 19th century, parishes across the country boasting clubs, until surging Irish nationalism in the form of the Gaelic Athletic Association declared the game an alien English import. \u201cUnfortunately the GAA won that battle,\u201d says Tector. Cricket became associated with \u201ccastle Catholics\u201d and \u201cwest Brits\u201d \u2013 posh Irish anglophiles. During the 1919-21 war of independence a suspected IRA gunman opened fire on a game at Trinity College Dublin, killing a spectator, Kathleen Wright.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8cc669fb4b31025050603ce41eebe0ef3051fde7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cc669fb4b31025050603ce41eebe0ef3051fde7/869_70_1864_2330/800.jpg\" alt=\"YMCA Cricket Club president Heatley Tector.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Lord\u2019s is the mecca,\u2019 says the YMCA club president, Heatley Tector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The game shrivelled, just a few dozen schools and clubs pursuing their lonely passion. Attitudes began to change in the 1970s when televised Test matches showed cricket to be a global \u2013 and at times thrilling \u2013 game. By his own admission Tector, 55, was a mediocre player \u2013 \u201cshite\u201d in fact \u2013 but he bequeathed passion to his three sons, all of whom have played for the national youth team, and to his daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s probably the best of them, though she\u2019d never say it.\u201d Perhaps because they are a small tribe, Ireland\u2019s cricketers pass the bug from father to son, mother to daughter, brother to sister.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very family focused,\u201d says Alan Lewis, a former Cricket Ireland chairman of selectors, speaking at Clontarf cricket club as children carry out drills under a bright Dublin sun. They are being coached by Isobel Joyce, who represented Ireland in last year\u2019s World Cup, and is the sister of Ed Joyce, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/may/26/smalltalk.sportinterviews\" title=\"\">left Ireland and played one-day internationals for England</a> before returning home and playing his one and only Test against Pakistan.</p> <p>Success transformed the game\u2019s image in Ireland.

Holdsworth, a key figure in paving Ireland\u2019s path to Lord\u2019s, is English. Karl McDermott, the head groundsman at Lord\u2019s, is Irish. Eoin Morgan, who led England to World Cup glory last Sunday, is from Dublin. Asked at a press conference if that triumph was assisted by the luck of the Irish, Morgan smiled and credited a team with diverse roots and faiths: \u201cWe had Allah with us as well.\u201d Ireland, a footnote in world cricket for much of the 20th century, vaulted into the top ranks by acquiring Test status in 2017, the fruit of a decade-long effort to expand, improve and meet International Cricket Council requirements. They came close to beating Pakistan at Malahide last year and lost badly to Afghanistan in India in March. Few expect a win in their third Test, even with England resting some of their World Cup winners. \u201cIt will be tricky,\u201d says Brian O\u2019Rourke, who used to coach a teenage Morgan and is now development manager for Cricket Leinster. \u201cBut the occasion will be huge. It will be a great showcase for what we can do.\u201d It will also showcase a side of Anglo-Irish relations ringfenced from Brexit rancour. The latest insult came in a report about Boris Johnson mocking the Indian heritage of Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?\u201d Days earlier Jacob Rees-Mogg attempted to politicise England\u2019s World Cup victory: \u201cWe clearly don\u2019t need Europe to win.\u201d That drew derision for overlooking the fact that five members of the 15-strong squad were born outside the UK. Ireland\u2019s fraught, twisting odyssey to Lord\u2019s contains an additional, tacit riposte to divisive rhetoric because it ends with an embrace of outsiders. Cricket was hugely popular in the 19th century, parishes across the country boasting clubs, until surging Irish nationalism in the form of the Gaelic Athletic Association declared the game an alien English import. \u201cUnfortunately the GAA won that battle,\u201d says Tector. Cricket became associated with \u201ccastle Catholics\u201d and \u201cwest Brits\u201d \u2013 posh Irish anglophiles. During the 1919-21 war of independence a suspected IRA gunman opened fire on a game at Trinity College Dublin, killing a spectator, Kathleen Wright. The game shrivelled, just a few dozen schools and clubs pursuing their lonely passion. Attitudes began to change in the 1970s when televised Test matches showed cricket to be a global \u2013 and at times thrilling \u2013 game. By his own admission Tector, 55, was a mediocre player \u2013 \u201cshite\u201d in fact \u2013 but he bequeathed passion to his three sons, all of whom have played for the national youth team, and to his daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s probably the best of them, though she\u2019d never say it.\u201d Perhaps because they are a small tribe, Ireland\u2019s cricketers pass the bug from father to son, mother to daughter, brother to sister. \u201cIt\u2019s very family focused,\u201d says Alan Lewis, a former Cricket Ireland chairman of selectors, speaking at Clontarf cricket club as children carry out drills under a bright Dublin sun. They are being coached by Isobel Joyce, who represented Ireland in last year\u2019s World Cup, and is the sister of Ed Joyce, who left Ireland and played one-day internationals for England before returning home and playing his one and only Test against Pakistan. Success transformed the game\u2019s image in Ireland. At their inaugural World Cup in 2007 the men\u2019s team knocked out Pakistan and made it to the Super Eight stage, prompting a rapturous homecoming. They scored another shock by beating England in the 2011 World Cup. Subsequent results disappointed. Young players struggled to fill gaps left by John Mooney, Trent Johnston and other stars who retired. Ireland remains a minnow \u2013 about 130 clubs compared to 6,000 in England, with an annual budget of only \u20ac10m, says Holdsworth. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. We have to be extremely careful with money.\u201d But he believes that restructuring over the past decade \u2013 more professionalism, coaches, training facilities, academies and clubs \u2013 augur improvement and will help keep talent at home rather than migrate to England. Brexit burgled cricket for the term \u201cbackstop\u201d, which is now politically radioactive, but in Ireland the game has an all-island structure that transcends the border \u2013 and politics \u2013 without any fuss. It also embodies a globalised Ireland that imports coaching talent from around the world. New clubs founded by immigrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh are sprouting across west Dublin. Afghans are doing the same around Cork. \u201cThey\u2019ll play anywhere, in a car park, a tennis court, anywhere that\u2019s flat enough,\u201d says Holdsworth. The squad to face England includes Simranjit \u201cSimi\u201d Singh, who was born in India. Ehtesham Ahmed, a contender for Pakistan\u2019s national team before moving to Ireland, has played 17 seasons in his adopted country. \u201cPeople notice I never miss a game. I tell them I just love my cricket. The passion rubs off,\u201d the 37-year-old says. Friends back in Karachi tease him over his allegiance. \u201cI back the shamrock against Pakistan. What can I say? This is my home now.\u201d",

In the deceptively warm embrace of an isolated commune, the group bear witness to horrific rituals and are slowly picked off one by one.</p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t really work.

Five old friends from university embark on a hiking trip to Sweden to commemorate the death of Rob, their friend who was beaten to death, while Luke, our unhappy protagonist, helplessly looked on. In an unexpected turn of events, the group stray into a forest where things begin to go wrong, and it\u2019s revealed that the forest dwellers worship a God-like monster living in the woods.</p> <p>As far as monsters go, The Ritual puts forward an impressive contender. Based on a <a href=\"https://mythology.wikia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn\">j\u00f6tunn</a> and the bastard child of <a href=\"https://mythology.wikia.org/wiki/Loki\">Loki</a>, the monster is grotesque and frightening. The slow reveal over the course of the film adds to the suspense, so that when the creature finally shows itself looking as weird as expected, it doesn\u2019t disappoint. And rather than being a wholly derivative plot device, the monster and the folklore behind it work to advance the sense of dread as the narrative moves forward.</p> <p>Where the monster makes impact in this film, other areas are lacking. The script is littered with so much swearing it feels as if the writers ran out of adjectives . We learn little about the characters, and, while the j\u00f6tunn is scary as hell, it isn\u2019t scary enough to obscure the plot flaws.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\">Midsommar review \u2013 outrageous black-comic carnival of agony | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mythology provides a plethora of opportunities to make well-crafted art-house horror; take a look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/10/the-witch-review-a-eerie-campfire-tale-that-gets-under-your-skin\">The Witch</a> as a prime example.

Even if its a murder-suicide involving your entire family, a mini-break to the European countryside is sure to sort it out. Unless, that is, you accidentally stumble on a hotbed of mythological creatures and beliefs. Then, I\u2019m afraid, you\u2019re screwed. It seems horror directors are getting a taste for Norse mythology. Fantastic beasts and pagan villages buried deep in the forest are being trotted out to wreak havoc on unwitting Americans trying to absolve themselves of past sins. While Sweden\u2019s extensive history of folklore is a rich field to plunder, Midsommar\u2019s mythological horror gives rise to more confusion than fright. In Midsommar, a young woman, Dani, has her life turned upside down when her parents and sister die in a tragic murder-suicide. When her boyfriend, Christian, and a group of lads go to Sweden to celebrate a midsummer festival, she tags along. In the deceptively warm embrace of an isolated commune, the group bear witness to horrific rituals and are slowly picked off one by one. But it doesn\u2019t really work. Dani\u2019s battle with the spectre of grief and self-doubt takes centre stage, but writer-director Ari Aster chooses to leapfrog Dani towards self-actualisation via stilted, unexplained interactions with ritual. Thanks to the power of paganism, Dani comes out the other side a stronger, more resilient, more hardened woman. Even if the story is entwined with cleverly researched mythology, the shallow exploration of character arcs and gratuitous violence wrapped in the guise of tradition leave us questioning why the hell we are here. Go back to 2017 and you\u2019ll find that David Bruckner\u2019s film The Ritual, based on a book of the same name, recounts an uncannily similar tale. Five old friends from university embark on a hiking trip to Sweden to commemorate the death of Rob, their friend who was beaten to death, while Luke, our unhappy protagonist, helplessly looked on. In an unexpected turn of events, the group stray into a forest where things begin to go wrong, and it\u2019s revealed that the forest dwellers worship a God-like monster living in the woods. As far as monsters go, The Ritual puts forward an impressive contender. Based on a j\u00f6tunn and the bastard child of Loki, the monster is grotesque and frightening. The slow reveal over the course of the film adds to the suspense, so that when the creature finally shows itself looking as weird as expected, it doesn\u2019t disappoint. And rather than being a wholly derivative plot device, the monster and the folklore behind it work to advance the sense of dread as the narrative moves forward. Where the monster makes impact in this film, other areas are lacking. The script is littered with so much swearing it feels as if the writers ran out of adjectives . We learn little about the characters, and, while the j\u00f6tunn is scary as hell, it isn\u2019t scary enough to obscure the plot flaws. Mythology provides a plethora of opportunities to make well-crafted art-house horror; take a look at The Witch as a prime example. In Midsommar and The Ritual, though, film-makers seem to be piggybacking on style to cover for a lack of substance. The main characters and the dialogue play as much a part in anchoring the film as the monsters do. Exploiting mythologies for cheap scares is not enough.",

I just would say you have known me for some time and I can perform this role.\u201d Merkel\u2019s ability to continue in the job she has held for 14 years has been questioned after three public incidents within three weeks in which her entire body appeared to shake. Speaking at the annual press conference she holds every year before her holiday, she repeated her pledge to step down in 2021, having already resigned as leader of the Christian Democratic party at the end of last year. In a speech contemplating her life after more than 30 years in politics, which drew laughter from assembled journalists, she said: \u201cI will finish my political work in 2021, but I hope that life will continue after that, and I would like it to continue in a healthy way.\u201d Pressed once again on how she was feeling, she said: \u201cSo many good questions are making me feel just fine.\u201d She condemned the US president, Donald Trump, for his racist attack on four congresswomen of colour whom he told to \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201cplaces from which they came\u201d. \u201cI firmly distance myself from [Trump\u2019s comments] and feel solidarity towards the attacked women.\u201d The German chancellor added: \u201cThe strength of America lies in the idea that people of different origins contribute to what makes the country great.\u201d In the wide-ranging question and answer session, which lasted for 90 minutes, Merkel was relaxed and quick-witted, defending her decision to promote her would-be successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to the role of defence minister. She said Germany should be proud that a German woman, Ursula von der Leyen \u2013 another close Merkel ally \u2013 was at the helm of the EU as its president. She credited environmental activists from the Fridays for Future movement \u2013 most notably the 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, who addressed a rally in Berlin on Friday \u2013 with \u201cdriving an acceleration\u201d of the government\u2019s actions on climate change, saying the protests meant climate was being dealt with \u201cmore decisively\u201d amid \u201cextraordinary weather conditions\u201d, which showed, she said, \u201cwhat damage is done by not acting on climate policy\u201d. Merkel has previously praised participants of the Fridays for Future demonstrations, refusing to join other politicians in Germany who have condemned participants for missing school. Asked whether she believed Britain might hold a second Brexit referendum, Merkel refused to be drawn, saying: \u201cI have no wish to participate in any sort of prognoses.\u201d She said the EU had already negotiated the exit agreement, adding that any movement on the Irish backstop would only be possible if an alternative solution for dealing with the border emerged. \u201cIf we find a solution for management of the border \u2026 then the backstop is obsolete [and] no longer relevant,\u201d she said, adding that the future relationship between the EU and the UK was dependent on a solution.

Weber proposed the idea that modern political legitimacy was a mixture of traditional, legal-bureaucratic and charismatic styles.</p> <p>Simply put, monarchies relied on tradition, democracies on legal-bureaucratic systems and modern dictators on charisma. In reality, Weber recognised all leadership was really a mix of these elements, and democracies could certainly develop their own charismatic politicians.

Using these mythic tropes, mission allows charismatic leaders to project a greater sense of purpose. \u201cMake America great again\u201d evokes this sense of mission, and Trump supplements this with targeted attacks on those deemed enemies of the vision: the supposed corruption of liberal politicians is summarised as \u201cLock her up!\u201d The pain and suffering of migrants are denied through \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d And now attacks on American citizens who, for some reason, should not be in the country can be voiced through \u201cSend her home!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/18/squad-mob-2020-election\">The Squad v the mob: that's what the 2020 election boils down to | Moustafa Baymoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s charisma is like a Rorschach inkblot test.

Moreover, given its emotional resonance, his appeal is not likely to be dented by rational arguments. Outraging people who decry his racism only adds to the attraction, as does condemnation from political elites.</p> <p>However, Weber argued that charisma was difficult to sustain. The appeal of Trump will ultimately be dimmed by his own failures to achieve his mission, which is ridiculous and unattainable. This will lead his supporters to lose interest, when he can no longer appear as the magician figure they thought he was.

Using these mythic tropes, mission allows charismatic leaders to project a greater sense of purpose. \u201cMake America great again\u201d evokes this sense of mission, and Trump supplements this with targeted attacks on those deemed enemies of the vision: the supposed corruption of liberal politicians is summarised as \u201cLock her up!\u201d The pain and suffering of migrants are denied through \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d And now attacks on American citizens who, for some reason, should not be in the country can be voiced through \u201cSend her home!\u201d Trump\u2019s charisma is like a Rorschach inkblot test. People can project on to it what they want to see. Some will deny he is a racist and simply view him as fighting for their interests. Others are convinced racists and will feel his presence allows them to say things they believe deeply, but are told they cannot say. Moreover, given its emotional resonance, his appeal is not likely to be dented by rational arguments. Outraging people who decry his racism only adds to the attraction, as does condemnation from political elites. However, Weber argued that charisma was difficult to sustain. The appeal of Trump will ultimately be dimmed by his own failures to achieve his mission, which is ridiculous and unattainable. This will lead his supporters to lose interest, when he can no longer appear as the magician figure they thought he was. We are not at this point yet, though, and it is difficult to known how long his \u201cmagic\u201d will last and what further damage will result. \u2022 Paul Jackson is a senior lecturer in history at the University of Northampton and author of Colin Jordan and Britain\u2019s Neo-Nazi Movement: Hitler\u2019s Echo",

      "body": "<p>May and June are the low season in Sri Lanka, but this year, following the Easter Sunday bombings, tourism ground to a halt. Hotels were empty, beaches were deserted and popular attractions that had been starting to suffer from overtourism were eerily quiet. The UK Foreign Office\u2019s warning against all but essential travel was issued on April 25, effectively forcing UK holidaymakers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/sri-lanka-faces-financial-blow-uk-holidaymakers-cancel-trips\">either cancel or postpone bookings</a>.</p> <p>Visitors in May were down 70% year on year. After the FCO changed its advice six weeks later on 6 June \u2013 and other countries lifted their restrictions \u2013 visitor numbers rose a little but were still 57% down year on year.</p> <p>\u201cWe had four yoga groups in May and June \u2013 they all had to cancel,\u201d says Kevin Abbott, owner of Jim\u2019s Farm Villas in central Sri Lanka. \u201cWe effectively closed the hotel. Last weekend we had our first guests since the attack.\u201d</p> <p>Three months after the bombings, the return of guests is a relief not just to Abbot but to the 20 staff who work at his hotel. During its closure, the staff were paid two-thirds of their normal salary and had 14 days off a month instead of seven. As of 1 July, all staff are back on full-time wages but Abbott believes occupancy rates are likely to be 50% lower than usual into 2020.</p> <p>In some ways people employed by hotels have been more fortunate than many other Sri Lankans who rely on tourism for their livelihoods. Most luxury hotels kept their staff on, albeit on lower wages. \u201cInstead of laying associates off, we decided to speak to all of them immediately after the attack, and instructed all the managers to focus on training and developing their skills in order to prepare for the regular flow of tourists in time to come,\u201d says Hashan Cooray, marketing director of Jetwing Hotels.</p> <p>But thousands tuktuk drivers, guides, souvenir and food sellers who are dependent on tourist spending saw their income disappear overnight.</p> <p>At Tuktuk Rental, a Colombo-based company that hires out tuktuks to travellers, bookings fell by 98% after the bombings. The operator rents tuktuks from local drivers rather than owning its own fleet of vehicles. \u201cAlmost all of our tuktuk suppliers are on financial loans with monthly instalments, which of course continue even without bookings,\u201d says manager Wietse Sennema. \u201cWe have had 10 tuktuk owners that had to sell their vehicles because they could not pay their finance on it anymore. Others had their tuktuks impounded by the finance company.\u201d</p> <p>Now, says Sennema, bookings are \u201cimproving much faster than expected\u201d and the company has been able to give drivers an interest-free loan to get their vehicles back. This week in London, the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, a group of over 160 hoteliers and tour operators, launched a campaign to revive tourism to the country. So far much of the publicity has focused on deals and the fact that tourists will have some of the country\u2019s biggest sights to themselves. But, for Sam Clark, founder of <a href=\"https://www.experiencetravelgroup.com/\">Experience Travel Group</a> and a co-founder of the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, the greatest benefit to travellers going now is the knowledge that their trip will have a direct and significant impact on local lives.</p> <p>\u201cBy returning to Sri Lanka and experiencing the country, it is ordinary Sri Lankans that you are helping most: your spending money goes much further, much faster than you might imagine. Just your presence in the country is taken as an endorsement of their efforts to recover,\u201d says Clark.</p> <p>Our local writer spoke to five Sri Lankans about their experience in the past three months and their hopes for the coming months.<br><strong>Isabel Choat</strong></p> <h2>Anjula Fernando, chauffeur-guide</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70c2d85e02bbd1309c3845d6607c35779e9e0d5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70c2d85e02bbd1309c3845d6607c35779e9e0d5a/0_397_960_828/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anjula Fernando, right, escorting tourists to a Sri Lanka cricket match.\" width=\"500\" height=\"431\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anjula Fernando, right, escorting tourists to a Sri Lanka cricket match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &quot;PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anjula has worked as a freelance chauffeur-guide for the last seven years. It can be a good career: in the past, during the high season from Christmas to April, he would take home 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees a month (\u00a31,370-\u00a31,600). Most chauffeur-guides maintain their own vehicles, though many have staggeringly high monthly loans to repay, meaning they have to work a set number of days just to break even. For Anjula, this equates to \u00a392 a month: manageable when work is good, as it has been for the last few years, but a problem when work dries up. Other drivers are dogged by much bigger loans, someover \u00a3460 a month, showing a blind determination to succeed in an industry that has grown exponentially over the last decade, since the end of the 26-year civil war in 2009.</p> <p>Anjula usually prepares for the quieter season (May to October) by keeping money aside to tide him over, but with no idea when bookings will pick up again, he has decided to sell his car.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m considering going to work in Dubai for a year or two, until tourism picks up again here,\u201d he says. \u201cI got married last year and we\u2019ve decided to wait until things are settled before having children.\u201d It\u2019s a common theme, and local travel companies reliant on their drivers are keen to keep them. A knowledgable and amiable chauffeur-guide can help make a holiday. .</p> <p>Despite everything, Anjula considers himself lucky. He lives less than a mile from St Sebastian\u2019s Church in Negombo, where he usually attends mass \u2013 and where more than 100 people died in the worst of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/22/sri-lanka-bombings-a-timeline-and-visual-guide\" title=\"\">Easter Sunday terror attacks</a>. He overslept that morning. Had he not, he and his wife would probably have been among the casualties.</p> <h2>Ruwan Pushpakumara, Udawalawe jeep driver</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec830ca5b30bdd2d0cbc06c87454407fa4762db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec830ca5b30bdd2d0cbc06c87454407fa4762db4/0_231_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An open topped jeep carries tourists into the national park of Udawalawe, Sri Lanka to search for wildlife in the park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Udawalawe national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For those passionate about wildlife, Sri Lanka is a place of great diversity, where leopard, sloth bears and elephants reside within 22 protected national parks. The attraction of higher-than-average earnings has lured some into safari-guiding, despite not having \u2013 nor, incredibly, needing \u2013 any formal wildlife training. But some parks are now oversubscribed, and the recent loss of business has left many in the industry reeling.</p> <p>Jeep driver Ruwan lives near Udawalawe national park, a southern reserve with a vast reservoir backed by the mist-laden mountains of the Hill Country. Elephants are part of life here: for some this is a blessing, as this is one of the best places in Sri Lanka to see them in the wild; for others they are pests that stray into farmland and destroy or consume crops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a21921941e47af35be2b3168797b957f064d260a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a21921941e47af35be2b3168797b957f064d260a/0_964_3024_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruwan Pushpakumara, Sri Lanka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"970\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruwan Pushpakumara</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &quot;PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 400 jeeps are registered with the park, so it helps that Ruwan has been the go-to driver for new safari lodge <a href=\"https://www.camphasthi.com/\" title=\"\">Camp Hasthi</a>, which opened last year. He also helps in the camp, which has four permanent tents with attached toilets and solar power, plus gardens of vegetables and mangos. Community-orientated, the camp\u2019s owners employ local villagers like Ruwan and source fish and fresh produce from local suppliers. As the sole breadwinner in the family \u2013supporting his wife, three-month-old son, parents and mother-in-law \u2013 Ruwan was earning a \u201ccomfortable\u201d average of \u00a3185 a month doing a job he loved.</p> <p>After the attacks, Ruwan started working as a labourer to make ends meet, and eventually, with Camp Hasthi\u2019s help, purchased a plough. He was also fortunate to have his father\u2019s four-acres of land to fall back on. Having neglected it in favour of jeep driving, it\u2019s now newly ploughed and seeded, and he hopes it will earn a profit when it\u2019s harvested next year.

      "bodyText": "May and June are the low season in Sri Lanka, but this year, following the Easter Sunday bombings, tourism ground to a halt. Hotels were empty, beaches were deserted and popular attractions that had been starting to suffer from overtourism were eerily quiet. The UK Foreign Office\u2019s warning against all but essential travel was issued on April 25, effectively forcing UK holidaymakers to either cancel or postpone bookings. Visitors in May were down 70% year on year. After the FCO changed its advice six weeks later on 6 June \u2013 and other countries lifted their restrictions \u2013 visitor numbers rose a little but were still 57% down year on year. \u201cWe had four yoga groups in May and June \u2013 they all had to cancel,\u201d says Kevin Abbott, owner of Jim\u2019s Farm Villas in central Sri Lanka. \u201cWe effectively closed the hotel. Last weekend we had our first guests since the attack.\u201d Three months after the bombings, the return of guests is a relief not just to Abbot but to the 20 staff who work at his hotel. During its closure, the staff were paid two-thirds of their normal salary and had 14 days off a month instead of seven. As of 1 July, all staff are back on full-time wages but Abbott believes occupancy rates are likely to be 50% lower than usual into 2020. In some ways people employed by hotels have been more fortunate than many other Sri Lankans who rely on tourism for their livelihoods. Most luxury hotels kept their staff on, albeit on lower wages. \u201cInstead of laying associates off, we decided to speak to all of them immediately after the attack, and instructed all the managers to focus on training and developing their skills in order to prepare for the regular flow of tourists in time to come,\u201d says Hashan Cooray, marketing director of Jetwing Hotels. But thousands tuktuk drivers, guides, souvenir and food sellers who are dependent on tourist spending saw their income disappear overnight. At Tuktuk Rental, a Colombo-based company that hires out tuktuks to travellers, bookings fell by 98% after the bombings. The operator rents tuktuks from local drivers rather than owning its own fleet of vehicles. \u201cAlmost all of our tuktuk suppliers are on financial loans with monthly instalments, which of course continue even without bookings,\u201d says manager Wietse Sennema. \u201cWe have had 10 tuktuk owners that had to sell their vehicles because they could not pay their finance on it anymore. Others had their tuktuks impounded by the finance company.\u201d Now, says Sennema, bookings are \u201cimproving much faster than expected\u201d and the company has been able to give drivers an interest-free loan to get their vehicles back. This week in London, the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, a group of over 160 hoteliers and tour operators, launched a campaign to revive tourism to the country. So far much of the publicity has focused on deals and the fact that tourists will have some of the country\u2019s biggest sights to themselves. But, for Sam Clark, founder of Experience Travel Group and a co-founder of the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, the greatest benefit to travellers going now is the knowledge that their trip will have a direct and significant impact on local lives. \u201cBy returning to Sri Lanka and experiencing the country, it is ordinary Sri Lankans that you are helping most: your spending money goes much further, much faster than you might imagine. Just your presence in the country is taken as an endorsement of their efforts to recover,\u201d says Clark. Our local writer spoke to five Sri Lankans about their experience in the past three months and their hopes for the coming months. Isabel Choat Anjula Fernando, chauffeur-guide Anjula has worked as a freelance chauffeur-guide for the last seven years. It can be a good career: in the past, during the high season from Christmas to April, he would take home 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees a month (\u00a31,370-\u00a31,600). Most chauffeur-guides maintain their own vehicles, though many have staggeringly high monthly loans to repay, meaning they have to work a set number of days just to break even. For Anjula, this equates to \u00a392 a month: manageable when work is good, as it has been for the last few years, but a problem when work dries up. Other drivers are dogged by much bigger loans, someover \u00a3460 a month, showing a blind determination to succeed in an industry that has grown exponentially over the last decade, since the end of the 26-year civil war in 2009. Anjula usually prepares for the quieter season (May to October) by keeping money aside to tide him over, but with no idea when bookings will pick up again, he has decided to sell his car. \u201cI\u2019m considering going to work in Dubai for a year or two, until tourism picks up again here,\u201d he says. \u201cI got married last year and we\u2019ve decided to wait until things are settled before having children.\u201d It\u2019s a common theme, and local travel companies reliant on their drivers are keen to keep them. A knowledgable and amiable chauffeur-guide can help make a holiday. . Despite everything, Anjula considers himself lucky. He lives less than a mile from St Sebastian\u2019s Church in Negombo, where he usually attends mass \u2013 and where more than 100 people died in the worst of the Easter Sunday terror attacks. He overslept that morning. Had he not, he and his wife would probably have been among the casualties. Ruwan Pushpakumara, Udawalawe jeep driver For those passionate about wildlife, Sri Lanka is a place of great diversity, where leopard, sloth bears and elephants reside within 22 protected national parks. The attraction of higher-than-average earnings has lured some into safari-guiding, despite not having \u2013 nor, incredibly, needing \u2013 any formal wildlife training. But some parks are now oversubscribed, and the recent loss of business has left many in the industry reeling. Jeep driver Ruwan lives near Udawalawe national park, a southern reserve with a vast reservoir backed by the mist-laden mountains of the Hill Country. Elephants are part of life here: for some this is a blessing, as this is one of the best places in Sri Lanka to see them in the wild; for others they are pests that stray into farmland and destroy or consume crops. More than 400 jeeps are registered with the park, so it helps that Ruwan has been the go-to driver for new safari lodge Camp Hasthi, which opened last year. He also helps in the camp, which has four permanent tents with attached toilets and solar power, plus gardens of vegetables and mangos. Community-orientated, the camp\u2019s owners employ local villagers like Ruwan and source fish and fresh produce from local suppliers. As the sole breadwinner in the family \u2013supporting his wife, three-month-old son, parents and mother-in-law \u2013 Ruwan was earning a \u201ccomfortable\u201d average of \u00a3185 a month doing a job he loved. After the attacks, Ruwan started working as a labourer to make ends meet, and eventually, with Camp Hasthi\u2019s help, purchased a plough. He was also fortunate to have his father\u2019s four-acres of land to fall back on. Having neglected it in favour of jeep driving, it\u2019s now newly ploughed and seeded, and he hopes it will earn a profit when it\u2019s harvested next year. Ruwan has learned a valuable lesson, too, and vows to keep it going even when the tourists return. Mark Forbes, Colombo walking tours With Colombo the focus of the Easter attacks, stays in the capital were quickly scrapped from visitors\u2019 itineraries. Parks and promenades, shopping centres and dining quarters fell silent in the weeks following. Colombo resident Mark Forbes (a Dutch Burgher), founder of Colombo City Walks, received many cancellations. He was also unable to honour the walk requests that did come in since access to the colonial-era Fort, focus of his most popular walks, was in an out-of-bounds high-security zone. Another of his key neighbourhoods, the Pettah, a multi-ethnic maze of streets selling wholesale items such as electronics and haberdashery to the entire country, had also fallen quiet. Security in Colombo has often been tight as a result of the civil war, however its renaissance since hostilities ceased has been astounding. Health-food cafes, rooftop bars, jogging tracks, restaurant districts, contemporary art galleries and high-rise condos and shopping centres have transformed it into a modern city. Visitors combine Mark\u2019s three-hour morning or afternoon walks with shopping in Barefoot or Paradise Road, and a meal in the Ministry of Crab, a restaurant within the sensitively renovated Old Dutch Hospital in Fort. Offering twice-daily walks, including hosting groups from passing cruise ships, Mark\u2019s team has grown to four. Since the beginning of July, Mark has noticed a dramatic increase in enquiries compared with May and June. Security is less tight around Fort and cordoned-off areas have reopened. Footfall is increasing in public areas and vendors working in the Pettah have mostly returned. Mark is feeling positive that resilient Colombo will soon return to form. Ratnasiri, souvenir-seller For 30 years Ratnasiri has been strolling the curve of Unawatuna beach, not far from the former Dutch colonial city of Galle, on the south-west coast, selling souvenirs to tourists from a black holdall. With his hands clutching a hand-hewn elephant, a stilt fishermen and a cascade of garishly painted key tag masks \u2013 all common souvenirs \u2013 he tells me some of his most successful days as a vendor were during the civil war, when souvenir shops \u2013 which now line the road uninterrupted into Unawatuna \u2013 were few and far between.

Platforms will be 415 metres long, taking up valuable real estate. The station would expand further should Northern Powerhouse Rail \u2013 a new east-west link across the Pennines \u2013 get built.</p> <p><a href=\"http://noturningbacknpr.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/A-Tunnel-Through-download.pdf\">Leaders in the north</a><a href=\"http://noturningbacknpr.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/A-Tunnel-Through-download.pdf\"> say</a> an integrated underground option at Piccadilly could add \u00a34bn to the Greater Manchester economy by 2035, while building above ground would \u201cresult in a sprawling train station in the heart of Manchester, slashing prime regeneration space\u201d. Burnham said the result would turn \u201chalf of central Manchester into a railway station\u201d.</p> <p>In London, Euston station will be remodelled vertically, with <a href=\"https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/a-new-vision-for-euston-station-revealed\">11 underground platforms</a> for HS2.</p> <p>\u201cThe government always seems to run out of money by the time they reach the north,\u201d said Burnham, who hopes to influence the design of the Manchester leg, which is not yet guaranteed to be built.</p> <p>He blamed London-centric decisionmakers for the Manchester station plans, which did not take account of future land values in the rapidly developing city. \u201cWhy are they trying to build HS2 on the surface here? The only answer I can give you is: because they can.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, MPs <a href=\"https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/planning-construction-news/mps-hs2-vote/60128/\">overwhelmingly voted</a> to build HS2 as far as Crewe, considered the gateway to the north of England.</p> <p>But the future of the rest of the line is far from guaranteed. Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has drawn up plans for an independent review of HS2 if he enters Downing Street as expected next week.</p> <p>Luke Raikes, a senior research fellow at IPPR North, which hosted Friday\u2019s event, said Burnham and other local leaders should have more say in transport planning: \u201cAn underground network may well be part of the solution for Greater Manchester, but regardless of which is the right option, the decisions about such investments should be made by accountable local politicians within Greater Manchester, not by remote officials in London. </p> <p>\u201cThe evidence shows that central government does not invest strategically across the country, and that local areas are much better placed to make these decisions.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has said Manchester should have an underground railway, as the cost of the delayed Crossrail project in London swelled to \u00a317.6bn. Burnham proposed a \u201cCrossrail for Manchester-type scenario\u201d where new railway lines would be built under central Manchester to help people get across the increasingly gridlocked city. He made the remarks at an event about the future of rail in the north of England on Friday, as MPs in Westminster lambasted Crossrail\u2019s delays and ballooning costs. A report from the public accounts committee said Crossrail \u2013 which connects Reading in Berkshire with Shenfield in Essex through central London via 26 miles of new tunnels \u2013 is now expected to be delivered up to two years behind schedule and \u00a32.8bn over budget. After London, Manchester has the worst road congestion in England, according to the National Infrastructure Commission, and Burnham believes creating a tube system under the city could be part of the solution. Burnham made the uncosted proposal as he pointed out that HS2, the new high-speed line from London that is supported by the Tory government and Labour, would run underground in the capital and its leafy suburbs \u2013 including for 21.6km (13.4 miles) under fields in the Chilterns \u2013 yet would bulldoze through central Manchester and large swathes of the north of England. Current plans for HS2 envisage the new line tunnelling under eight miles of Greater Manchester from Manchester airport before emerging above ground at Manchester Piccadilly. Platforms will be 415 metres long, taking up valuable real estate. The station would expand further should Northern Powerhouse Rail \u2013 a new east-west link across the Pennines \u2013 get built. Leaders in the north say an integrated underground option at Piccadilly could add \u00a34bn to the Greater Manchester economy by 2035, while building above ground would \u201cresult in a sprawling train station in the heart of Manchester, slashing prime regeneration space\u201d. Burnham said the result would turn \u201chalf of central Manchester into a railway station\u201d. In London, Euston station will be remodelled vertically, with 11 underground platforms for HS2. \u201cThe government always seems to run out of money by the time they reach the north,\u201d said Burnham, who hopes to influence the design of the Manchester leg, which is not yet guaranteed to be built. He blamed London-centric decisionmakers for the Manchester station plans, which did not take account of future land values in the rapidly developing city. \u201cWhy are they trying to build HS2 on the surface here? The only answer I can give you is: because they can.\u201d Earlier this week, MPs overwhelmingly voted to build HS2 as far as Crewe, considered the gateway to the north of England. But the future of the rest of the line is far from guaranteed. Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has drawn up plans for an independent review of HS2 if he enters Downing Street as expected next week. Luke Raikes, a senior research fellow at IPPR North, which hosted Friday\u2019s event, said Burnham and other local leaders should have more say in transport planning: \u201cAn underground network may well be part of the solution for Greater Manchester, but regardless of which is the right option, the decisions about such investments should be made by accountable local politicians within Greater Manchester, not by remote officials in London. \u201cThe evidence shows that central government does not invest strategically across the country, and that local areas are much better placed to make these decisions.\u201d",

Your life is all about fantasy, which is fun for a bit but no substitute for real-life love, which is what you seem to want. There appear to be three points in your falling-in-love scenario: your initial attraction, the fantasy you build of that person, and then disclosure.</p> <p>The first and third are rooted in reality \u2013 the person exists when you first see them, and when you tell them. But the second part of the sequence is not based in reality. It is a fantasy centred around the person you imagine you are in love with, and it grows to epic proportions. The other person isn\u2019t at all engaged in this process \u2013 she has no idea how you feel. When you eventually tell her, of course, it\u2019s shocking and overwhelming for her. In different circumstances, she might have been more receptive to a relationship. If you could narrow the gaps between these three points \u2013 more reality, less fantasy \u2013 it might help you to understand who you are and what it is you really want.</p> <p>Psychotherapist Martin Weaver (UK Council for Psychotherapy, <a href=\"https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">psychotherapy.org.uk</a>) wondered what you were like as a boy \u2013 did you do a lot of reading/watching films?

Your life is all about fantasy, which is fun for a bit but no substitute for real-life love, which is what you seem to want. There appear to be three points in your falling-in-love scenario: your initial attraction, the fantasy you build of that person, and then disclosure. The first and third are rooted in reality \u2013 the person exists when you first see them, and when you tell them. But the second part of the sequence is not based in reality. It is a fantasy centred around the person you imagine you are in love with, and it grows to epic proportions. The other person isn\u2019t at all engaged in this process \u2013 she has no idea how you feel. When you eventually tell her, of course, it\u2019s shocking and overwhelming for her. In different circumstances, she might have been more receptive to a relationship. If you could narrow the gaps between these three points \u2013 more reality, less fantasy \u2013 it might help you to understand who you are and what it is you really want. Psychotherapist Martin Weaver (UK Council for Psychotherapy, psychotherapy.org.uk) wondered what you were like as a boy \u2013 did you do a lot of reading/watching films? If so, you might need to look at whether it was for entertainment or as a retreat from life because reality was, in some way, too painful. And has this led you, in the absence of real-life experience, to romanticise relationships? \u201cWhy do you wait,\u201d Weaver asked, \u201cto have the big conversation [with women] instead of lots of smaller ones?\u201d I thought this was a really important question: what stops you getting to know these women before you tell them how you feel? Weaver also wondered what your job was, and whether it \u201cisolated or disconnected you [from real life]\u201d. Do you have everyday interaction with women? \u201cYour world is very internal and, because of this, you are not learning how to create a relationship that is engaging and empathic, nor are you learning that you can influence what happens.\u201d Heartbreak need not be inevitable. You are right that therapy, other than cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), isn\u2019t always easy to get on the NHS, but I wonder if you would consider spending some money on it? If so, you can find therapists via the UKCP website. I think having somewhere private where you could talk freely and get another perspective would benefit you enormously. One final point I want you to ponder: Weaver felt the way you describe these situations sounded as if you felt you had \u201cno control, no agency over what happens\u201d \u2013 where did you learn that? \u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

A \u00a32bn public sector pay rise, the biggest in six years, is expected to be announced by the Treasury on Monday as one of May\u2019s last acts as prime minister. Only 2 million of 5.36 million public sector workers are expected to benefit and, with the exception of some extra funding for schools, the rises are expected to have to be drawn from existing budgets. The GMB union said the alleged plans were \u201cselective handouts\u201d that will give nothing to support staff, most civil servants and people employed by local authorities. The union\u2019s national secretary, Rehana Azam, said: \u201cNot only is this a pitiful pay rise, but it\u2019s an insult to the millions of public sector workers it ignores. \u201cThese are the people who look after us, help our children learn, and keep our towns and cities running. The news was also met with concerns from headteachers over how the increases could affect schools, which are already struggling to cope with funding cuts. Evidence submitted by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, to the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body earlier this year, argued that schools could only afford a 2% pay rise for teachers \u2013 meaning that the remaining 0.75% would need additional funding. Jules White, a secondary school headteacher in West Sussex who has led a national campaign to increase school funding, said his colleagues would be \u201cdismayed\u201d to learn most of the pay increase would come from current school budgets. \u201cHeads are being given Hobson\u2019s choice.

Gail Cartmail, assistant general secretary at one of Britain\u2019s biggest trade unions, Unite, argued that public sector workers were being used as \u201ca political football\u201d. She argued that while all should benefit from the rise, the current proposal would not be enough to catch up with pay after years of pay freezes. \u201cThe idea that police officers would think that this was the best thing since sliced bread given the huge pressure on police \u2026 It just doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d said Cartmail. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2019 because Unite is one of Britain\u2019s biggest trade unions, not the biggest as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "A businessman has admitted his part in an international corruption conspiracy following a criminal investigation into alleged bribery in the energy industry. Basil Al Jarah, 70, from Hull, pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiring to give corrupt payments to public officials to secure commercial contracts in Iraq at Southwark crown court, London. It is the first guilty plea to result from a three-year investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into suspected bribery and money laundering involving a Monaco-based oil and gas firm Unaoil. Al Jarah, described by the SFO as Unaoil\u2019s former partner in Iraq, pleaded guilty on Monday. His admission can be reported after a legal restriction was lifted on Friday. According to the SFO, the five counts relate to conduct between 2005 and 2013, and the award of contracts to supply and install single-point moorings and oil pipelines in southern Iraq. Three other individuals have pleaded not guilty and will face trial next year. The indictment placed before the court also names other people and companies Al Jarah is said to have acted with. No charges have been laid against those other people or businesses, and being named in the indictment does not constitute proof of guilt. Named in connection with all five counts are three members of the Ahsani family who formerly owned and controlled Unaoil \u2013 Ata, the firm\u2019s founder, and his two sons Cyrus and Saman. The Ahsanis have denied any wrongdoing in connection with the work of Unaoil and described the allegations against the firm as malicious and damaging. Last month, it emerged that the SFO has dropped its investigation into the Ahsani family, although its investigation into Unaoil continues. The SFO declined to explain its decision to stop investigating the family. Also named in the indictment against Al Jarah is Ahmed al-Jibouri, the chief executive and founder of a Jordanian energy consultancy. Al Jarah is accused of acting with al-Jibouri to give corrupt payments to Iraqi officials in connection with two contracts.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has won the backing of more than half of MPs across all factions of the Conservative party, many of whom will be keen to have their enthusiastic outings in the media rewarded with a plum promotion.</p> <p>But how can Johnson keep the very different wings of the party inside the tent when he has more ambitious backers than jobs to go round \u2013 and avoid making enemies by demoting senior supporters?</p> <p>Here\u2019s a look at how his cabinet appointments could play out.</p> <h2>Chancellor</h2> <p>Liz Truss, one of the earliest supporters of Johnson, has been making the biggest public pitch for this job and is a keen champion of measures such as tax cuts for higher earners that Johnson has made part of his campaign \u2013 though the pair disagree strongly on the need to build on the greenbelt, which Truss believes would boost growth.</p> <p>Yet she is by no means a shoo-in for the job. Sajid Javid has been tipped to have a stronger chance. The health secretary Matt Hancock, who made an unexpected switch to back Johnson, also has his hopes pinned on the Treasury \u2013 probably unsuccessfully.</p> <h2>Cabinet Office</h2> <p>Johnson will need a trusted ally in the de facto deputy prime minister role, currently occupied by David Lidington. Earlier in the campaign it was rumoured it could go to Johnson\u2019s leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, though the race has been more bitter than expected.</p> <p>It is more likely that Johnson could reward his campaign manager, Iain Duncan Smith, with this role, or someone like his former City Hall ally Kit Malthouse, who has won the trust of many MPs for his work on alternative arrangements for the backstop.</p> <h2>Home secretary</h2> <p>Javid could stay in this senior role if Johnson does not make him chancellor \u2013 or it could be a job for Hancock if Johnson believes his loyalty deserves a senior promotion. It is also one of the only roles which could go to Hunt and not be seen as a demotion.</p> <p>Another tipped for the job is Dominic Raab, widely seen to have been auditioning by outlining a plan for an immigration system as part of his own leadership pitch \u2013 something denied by Raab at the time.</p> <h2>Foreign secretary</h2> <p>Hunt has resisted sideways moves before, refusing point-blank to move from health when Theresa May attempted to reshuffle him to business secretary, and his allies have briefed that he may try to pull the same move if Johnson wants to move him from the Foreign Office.</p> <p>If Johnson wanted a change, he could place Amber Rudd in the role if he was convinced she would not resign over no deal \u2013 or Penny Mordaunt if he wanted to free up defence for another candidate.</p> <h2>Defence secretary</h2> <p>Johnson could decide to keep Mordaunt, the first female defence secretary, in the role where she has been impressing colleagues. But one of Johnson\u2019s closest and oldest allies, Ben Wallace, is said to have his eye on the job.</p> <p>Some Tory MPs speculate he will promote Mordaunt, a Brexiter, to one of the big offices of state. Gavin Williamson, who organised MPs for Johnson during the votes in parliament, is rumoured to have told officials he would like to return to the role from which he was sacked by Theresa May for leaking from the National Security Council. However, that is unlikely to be popular with civil servants.</p> <h2>Chief whip</h2> <p>This role will be absolutely pivotal for Johnson as he tries to steer his Brexit policies through a hostile parliament. Grant Shapps, a former Tory chairman, has won admiration in the Johnson camp for his forensic spreadsheet on his fellow MPs that documents all their views and interests. Williamson could also return to the role after working as May\u2019s enforcer but some of Johnson\u2019s allies are concerned he has made too many enemies.</p> <h2>Business secretary</h2> <p>This is the most obvious place to put Truss if she does not make chancellor.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has won the backing of more than half of MPs across all factions of the Conservative party, many of whom will be keen to have their enthusiastic outings in the media rewarded with a plum promotion. But how can Johnson keep the very different wings of the party inside the tent when he has more ambitious backers than jobs to go round \u2013 and avoid making enemies by demoting senior supporters? Here\u2019s a look at how his cabinet appointments could play out. Chancellor Liz Truss, one of the earliest supporters of Johnson, has been making the biggest public pitch for this job and is a keen champion of measures such as tax cuts for higher earners that Johnson has made part of his campaign \u2013 though the pair disagree strongly on the need to build on the greenbelt, which Truss believes would boost growth. Yet she is by no means a shoo-in for the job. Sajid Javid has been tipped to have a stronger chance. The health secretary Matt Hancock, who made an unexpected switch to back Johnson, also has his hopes pinned on the Treasury \u2013 probably unsuccessfully. Cabinet Office Johnson will need a trusted ally in the de facto deputy prime minister role, currently occupied by David Lidington. Earlier in the campaign it was rumoured it could go to Johnson\u2019s leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, though the race has been more bitter than expected. It is more likely that Johnson could reward his campaign manager, Iain Duncan Smith, with this role, or someone like his former City Hall ally Kit Malthouse, who has won the trust of many MPs for his work on alternative arrangements for the backstop. Home secretary Javid could stay in this senior role if Johnson does not make him chancellor \u2013 or it could be a job for Hancock if Johnson believes his loyalty deserves a senior promotion. It is also one of the only roles which could go to Hunt and not be seen as a demotion. Another tipped for the job is Dominic Raab, widely seen to have been auditioning by outlining a plan for an immigration system as part of his own leadership pitch \u2013 something denied by Raab at the time. Foreign secretary Hunt has resisted sideways moves before, refusing point-blank to move from health when Theresa May attempted to reshuffle him to business secretary, and his allies have briefed that he may try to pull the same move if Johnson wants to move him from the Foreign Office. If Johnson wanted a change, he could place Amber Rudd in the role if he was convinced she would not resign over no deal \u2013 or Penny Mordaunt if he wanted to free up defence for another candidate. Defence secretary Johnson could decide to keep Mordaunt, the first female defence secretary, in the role where she has been impressing colleagues. But one of Johnson\u2019s closest and oldest allies, Ben Wallace, is said to have his eye on the job. Some Tory MPs speculate he will promote Mordaunt, a Brexiter, to one of the big offices of state. Gavin Williamson, who organised MPs for Johnson during the votes in parliament, is rumoured to have told officials he would like to return to the role from which he was sacked by Theresa May for leaking from the National Security Council. However, that is unlikely to be popular with civil servants. Chief whip This role will be absolutely pivotal for Johnson as he tries to steer his Brexit policies through a hostile parliament. Grant Shapps, a former Tory chairman, has won admiration in the Johnson camp for his forensic spreadsheet on his fellow MPs that documents all their views and interests. Williamson could also return to the role after working as May\u2019s enforcer but some of Johnson\u2019s allies are concerned he has made too many enemies. Business secretary This is the most obvious place to put Truss if she does not make chancellor. The incumbent, Greg Clark, is almost certain to leave the government after abstaining on the most recent votes aimed at stopping no deal. Other Johnson supporters with a shot at the department could include Priti Patel, Esther McVey or Michael Fallon. Brexit secretary Johnson needs someone with an eye for detail and existing knowledge of Brussels in this crucial role. Stephen Barclay could stay in the post as someone who endorsed Johnson early. It could also be a role for Raab, the former Brexit secretary who claims his efforts to strike a tougher bargain were frustrated by No 10. Justice secretary This is another department where the incumbent, David Gauke, is likely to head to the backbenches. Johnson could give the role to Raab, a former international lawyer, or to Geoffrey Cox, the current attorney general. Education secretary It would probably be a dream role for Andrea Leadsom, a former leader of the House of Commons, who has a specialist interest in early years. However, the brief could also be a juicy promotion for a junior ministerial backer of Johnson \u2013 or even his brother, Jo Johnson, though he has serious qualms about no deal. Health secretary Johnson could decide to keep Hancock at the brief where he has spent just over a year, or it could be a role he gives to Rudd, which keeps its holder at arm\u2019s length from any Brexit turmoil. This could be another role where Johnson hands a big promotion to a new-generation supporter. Environment secretary Johnson\u2019s erstwhile rival Michael Gove has made waves in this brief but he appeared to hint in a speech this week that he was keen to hand on his legacy to a successor. One name in the frame could be Zac Goldsmith, an enthusiastic environmentalist who has also been a cheerleader for Johnson. Transport secretary Gove could be handed a department in desperate need of revitalising, especially if Johnson decides that HS2 needs an image makeover. It also gives his rival another tricky department in terms of no-deal planning. Sources close to Johnson have also tipped Williamson for the role. Work and pensions secretary Rudd has made no secret of wanting to stay on, ditching her opposition to no deal in a plea to keep her job. Johnson may decide this is a safe non-Brexit place for her, where her softer approach than predecessors could allow him to claim some one nation credentials on domestic policy. On the other hand, he could go harder with an appointment such as Patel or a return for McVey or Duncan Smith. Housing and communities secretary James Brokenshire improved his prospects of staying in the job by backing Johnson but he was a May loyalist for so long that a new prime minister is more likely to hand it to one of his own allies. Several Tory MPs have said they would like to see Gove turn his reforming zeal to a department where the policies could be defining at the next election. However, Malthouse and Jake Berry, two close Johnson allies, have both been ministers in that department so their names are also in the frame. International development secretary Johnson had little time for this department when he was in the Foreign Office and was thought to want to absorb it into his own, so he could attempt a merger. It seems unlikely that Rory Stewart, his former leadership rival, will be allowed to stay on.

      "bodyText": "Well, I for one welcome the news: as of this week, anybody asked to cover up while breastfeeding on a KLM flight can now walk, bare-breasted, across the plane, milk firing into the air, their baby howling at their shoulder, and immediately hand that screaming, hungry, suffering child to the person who made the complaint, who must then look after that baby for the entirety of the journey while the previously breastfeeding passenger lies back, watches a film, reads their book, has a glass of wine or enjoys a much-needed nap. Because, my friends, that is precisely what I would do if someone asked me to cover myself while breastfeeding. This week, the Dutch airline KLM garnered a lactic tonne of deserved criticism after it put out a tweet stating that \u201cto ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this\u201d. This was itself a response to one customer\u2019s complaint, posted on Facebook, that she had been asked by a flight attendant to cover herself with a blanket \u2013 you know, like an actual fire \u2013 while breastfeeding her baby because someone else on the plane had complained. Before we get into the pure misogyny of telling total strangers that the sight of a few centimetres of skin, between collarbone and ribs, is somehow unbearably disturbing, impossibly erotic or physically repulsive, let\u2019s just have a quick chew on the cracked nipple of that phrase \u201cpassengers of all backgrounds\u201d. I\u2019m no theologist, but even I know that in every major world religion breastfeeding is positively encouraged. In Genesis, the Bible says: \u201cBy the God of your father who will help you, by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.\u201d According to Islam, breastfeeding forgives you of all your minor sins.

In Hinduism, breastfeeding mothers like the goddess Parvati are found throughout the pantheon, and the ancient Sanskrit text Sushruta Samhita states: \u201cMay four oceans, full of milk, constantly abide in both your breasts, you blessed one, for the increase of the strength of the child!\u201d So, let\u2019s be clear: these customers of \u201call backgrounds\u201d don\u2019t appear to have any religious foundation for their squeamishness, fear, repulsion or anger.

That isn\u2019t all that surprising, because red wine accounts for three-quarters of the wines produced in the region, and whites only 10% (the rest is ros\u00e9). But that latter figure does include a number of stellar white wines, including Condrieu and the white incarnations of Hermitage and Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape.</p> <p>I recently had the opportunity to drink a couple of older vintages of white hermitage, a 1998 and an 1983 in magnum from the legendary <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/grower-profile-jean-louis-chave\" title=\"\">Jean-Louis Chave</a>, and both were extraordinary \u2013 like great white burgundy, but still astoundingly fresh and among the greatest white wines I\u2019ve ever tasted. They\u2019re way out of most people\u2019s price bracket, of course, even if you could get your hands on a bottle. However, I was impressed to find that a splendidly named wine broker called <a href=\"https://www.crsfw.com\" title=\"\">Crump Richmond Shaw</a> carries some 60 lines of current and older Chave vintages that you can pick up from around \u00a3130, which is much the same price as a bottle of Dom Perignon and far rarer. It also pays to ferret around in country wine merchants: at the time of writing, for instance, the wonderful <a href=\"https://dbyrne-finewines.co.uk\" title=\"\">D Byrne in Clitheroe</a> had the 2013 for \u00a3150 (gulp!), while Yapp Brothers, which has imported it for years, always has <a href=\"https://www.yapp.co.uk/Wine-List/Rhone-Wines/Hermitage-Wines/Hermitage-Jean-Louis-Chave-Blanc-2012/\" title=\"\">some back vintages</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, I digress.

That means the style can depend as much on the grapes a particular producer grows, and the proportions in which he or she uses them, as on the appellation or cru it comes from. But it\u2019s a reasonable generalisation to say that Rh\u00f4ne whites are rich and full-bodied (and quite often high in alcohol), redolent of peaches and apricots and generally fresher and more floral than viognier on its own, and similarly weighted but more aromatic than an oaked chardonnay.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2019 What it was Arguably the most doomed film in cinema history: 26 years after the first wave of Sonic-mania, and five years after the subsequent internet-driven horny fan art era, Paramount decided to make a CGI retelling of the Sonic legend with a hedgehog that looks as if someone embedded children\u2019s teeth in a dog. What it looked like The initial Sonic trailer was proof of concept that CGI has gone too far: not only can computers now render, say, the small hairs on a forearm, it can now dive deep into my very darkest nightmares and extract them whole, putting them on screen for all to see. How it made us feel As if someone retconned my childhood to make it bad: it\u2019s like someone\u2019s told me Sunny D is actually owned by Putin and finger skateboards are Isis propaganda. What happened? Fans have pushed for a redesign (it\u2019s not even that hard: make the body shorter, the eyes bigger, the lips less human, then cancel the film) and Paramount appears to have relented.

Not in a sweary way but he made himself clear about how he corrected us: \u2018No, don\u2019t go here, go there, you have to do this.\u2019 But he got a lot of respect, especially from the younger players, because he really cared about us and really improved our play. And he was a nice man. A hard coach but a nice man.\u201d</p> <p>Freeman\u2019s playing career was ended prematurely by a broken leg. It began at Cambridge United and included spells with Stevenage, Romford and San Diego Toros, where he played against Pel\u00e9 and was a teammate of another Brazilian World Cup winner, Vav\u00e1. His manager at San Diego was George Curtis, who knew him from Stevenage and who would later take charge of the Norwegian national team. It was he who recommended Freeman to Brann in 1972, aware that his former player was an excellent leader and educator: Freeman had, after all, become the youngest person to gain full coaching qualifications from the FA, graduating at the age of 21 from a course run by Bobby Robson.</p> <p>Freeman embraced the Brann challenge. The club was struggling when he arrived, not least because of the six-month suspension imposed on Jensen for booting a referee during a pre-season indoor tournament. Jensen was one of Norway\u2019s best-loved sportsmen, the first of their footballers to make an impression in Britain, having had an eye-catching but injury-plagued stint at Hearts. Known as \u201c<em>Kniksen\u201d</em> (\u201cJuggler\u201d) because of his trickery, he was celebrated by fans for his maverick larks: one story says that during a victory over Rosenborg that condemned Brann\u2019s arch-rivals to relegation, <em>Kniksen</em> took off his boots and played on in his socks so as to deepen Rosenborg\u2019s humiliation. He was so good that even though his ban meant he featured in only 10 games in 1972, he won the league\u2019s player of the season award. Years later, in 1990, the annual award was officially renamed the <em>Kniksenprisen</em>.</p> <p>Freeman would not have succeeded if he had pandered to one player, especially a player who was not allowed to play most matches. The manager\u2019s skill was to foster cohesion and spirit while improving each individual. \u201cHe was particularly special to me,\u201d says Dahl. \u201cI was only 17 when he arrived. He saw me play for the youths and put me into the team ahead of a 33-year-old ex-international! He taught me a lot of technique.

      "bodyText": "SK Brann\u2019s Europa League campaign ended on Thursday with a 2-1 defeat by Shamrock Rovers in Dublin, just down the road from where their very first continental adventure foundered 46 years ago at the hands of the Belfast side Glentoran. Decades of competition in Europe for the Norwegian club began under the guidance of an intrepid Englishman, Ray Freeman, who died this year and is remembered with great fondness. Brann fans used to call him the Madman of Bergen because of his touchline gesticulations and hollering. But his method and personality won such admiration that within two years of his arrival he became the first person to be awarded honorary citizen status in Norway\u2019s second-biggest city. He inspired Brann to their first Norwegian Cup triumph for 47 years. Which was some going for a man who took the job when he was only 27 and just after Brann\u2019s star player, Roald Jensen, had been banned for kicking a referee up the backside. Freeman had a knack for bringing the best out of people and a determination to make the most of himself. \u201cBrann had used foreign coaches before but not for a long time, but when Ray came he got a lot of respect,\u201d recalls the former Brann midfielder Bj\u00f8rn Dahl. \u201cBut it was tough.

You know what? If they don\u2019t love it, tell \u2019em to leave it,\u201d Trump said to the crowd, who soon erupted into a chant of \u201csend her back\u201d. Yet Trump himself has repeatedly denigrated and criticized America, perhaps more so than any other presidential candidate in recent memory. If he holds himself to his own standards, perhaps it\u2019s time for him to leave and \u201cgo back home\u201d? Here are some examples of Trump\u2019s attacks on the US. Make America great again A longtime critic of Obama, Trump has said he came upon his famed slogan the day his predecessor was elected to his second term. The Maga slogan implied that America was no longer great, something he also repeatedly and explicitly stated in much starker terms in the years before and during his run. Speaking to the Washington Post in 2017, he said: I looked at the many types of illness our country had, and whether it\u2019s at the border, whether it\u2019s security, whether it\u2019s law and order or lack of law and order. Crippled America Trump\u2019s 2015 book, Crippled America, was rife with critical quotes, referring to the country as \u201cthis mess\u201d and \u201cUncle Sucker\u201d, among other things, and took great pains to point out just how weak we had become. The idea of American Greatness, of our country as the leader of the free and unfree world, has vanished \u2026 I couldn\u2019t stand to see what was happening to our great country. This mess calls for leadership in the worst way. American carnage On the day he took office in 2017, Trump painted a picture of America as a dystopian nightmare. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. Laughing stock The idea that criticizing the country is grounds for being dismissed from it would be news to the Donald Trump of the Obama years, when he described our collective humiliation many dozens of times. Stretching back to 2011, he regularly tweeted about which countries and other political bodies were laughing at us and Obama, from Opec to \u201cthe mullahs\u201d, Sudan, and, most frequently, China and Vladimir Putin. Lots of killers When asked during an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly in 2017 about his praise for Putin, Trump said America wasn\u2019t much better. But was Putin was \u201ca killer\u201d, O\u2019Reilly said. Trump replied: There are a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent? Infrastructure Trump has not only often referred to the symbolic collapse of America, he\u2019s also pointed out its literal state of disrepair. His speech to the 2016 Republican national convention was a laundry list of things that he found shameful about the country, including our infrastructure. He told the crowd: Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third-world condition.",

Johnson has been accused of stoking division and extremist views by suggesting last year that Muslim women wearing a burqa looked like letterboxes or bank robbers. His choice of language has frequently been challenged, including when he referred to the former US president Barack Obama as \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d, when he wrote a poem in the same year about the Turkish president having sex with a goat, and when he referred in 2002 to Commonwealth residents as \u201cflag-waving piccaninnies\u201d. It emerged this week that he once argued in an essay that Islam had caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west.

McDermott believes that in big cities like Edinburgh, the public and the authorities have become inured to discarded needles, obviously intoxicated beggars and \u201cjust another junkie death\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t ask the addicts what they need. They don\u2019t ask those that would sell their soul for a bag, whose children are in care because drugs mean more.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Segregated play spaces are to be banned in all future London housing developments, the Greater London Authority (GLA) has revealed this week. The policy, part of the London Plan for developers and local authorities across the city, follows outrage across the political spectrum at the case of the Lilian Baylis estate in Kennington. Guardian Cities reported that families living in the social housing side of the estate were not allowed to use the play area or any communal spaces on the development. Henley Homes, the company that built the wall dividing the estate, have since removed it and last week paid for a party for all residents to apologise for the segregation. Under the new policy developments, where there are a mix of tenures \u2013 private owners alongside \u201caffordable\u201d housing including shared ownership and social rented accommodation \u2013 developers will no longer be allowed to build play areas that are accessible only to people in the most expensive properties. Sadiq Khan told the Guardian \u201cit is disgraceful that children who live in the same development would ever be prevented from playing together\u201d.

This makes it very clear how we expect builders and developers to protect our values as a city.\u201d However, campaigners say the new policy has not fully resolved the problem because it will have no impact on estates that have already been built or are in development. In March the Guardian was contacted by people across the UK reporting segregation on their estates. In Greenwich, families in social and affordable housing on the Seren Park Gardens estate have failed to gain access to a gated podium play space. The housing association, Moat Homes, argue the affected block is a separate development. It said in a statement: \u2018They are separate developments and all residents \u2026 have access to the amenities within their particular developments.\u201d However, the Guardian has seen marketing and sales material describing the blocks as forming a single development and documents promising a play area as part of planning permission. When the Guardian visited the site, Emma, a mother of three who lives in social rented accommodation, was bringing two toddlers out to play in the car park, 100 metres from the locked playground. Emma and her neighbours feel that the affordable homes were built to meet a target but then put in a separate building so they wouldn\u2019t have to be given access to communal spaces. She said: \u201cWe are the 20% affordable, aren\u2019t we? They\u2019ve just shoved us all in one block and given us nothing.

      "bodyText": "Soldiers have begun patrolling poor neighbourhoods on the outskirts of Cape Town in a controversial move aimed at curbing gang violence. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, signed off last week on the decision to send the army into the Cape Flats, a sprawling area of townships that is a legacy of the repressive and racist apartheid regime\u2019s policy of separating white and non-white communities. Bloodshed over the past seven months in mainly poor black and mixed-race areas has killed more than 2,000 people, almost half gang-related, provincial officials said. The South African National Defence Force said it was deploying a battalion of several hundred soldiers with support elements to back up the police, who have struggled to contain the violence. \u201cFor an hour and a half they targeted houses and cordoned off some streets \u2026 They did some raids with the anti-gang unit and the local police,\u201d said Kader Jacobs, chairman of the Manenberg Community Policing Forum, which helps crime prevention in the working-class Manenberg suburb. \u201cI think the people expected the army to be in the area at least between eight and 12 hours, not a cameo visit of an hour and a half and off you go,\u201d he said. Critics say the move will do nothing to solve deep-rooted social and political problems in areas suffering high rates of unemployment, domestic violence and drug abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary band-aid on a problem which lies elsewhere \u2026 When they leave, if they can, the violence will bounce back, as it did then,\u201d said Don Pinnock, a correspondent in the area with News24, a local TV network. One convoy of armoured personnel carriers, with an estimated 200 soldiers, drove through Hanover Park, a neighbourhood known for high levels of crime. It was built more than 50 years ago to house mixed-race families displaced from suburbs designated whites-only. Shafiek Faure, a resident, told reporters the army intervention was necessary to allow the police force to \u201ctake back the area\u201d. \u201cSo we citizens can live safely and especially our kids, who are dying like flies here in Hanover Park and so many other areas of the Western Cape,\u201d Faure said. The soldiers will stay on the streets until October, although the defence minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, suggested on Wednesday that the \u201cexit strategy\u201d would be determined by intelligence gathering. The deployment was promised by the police minister, Bheki Cele, after he visited the poor Philippi neighbourhood where almost a dozen people were killed in three days this month. Famous for its stunning tourist attractions, including Robben Island and Table Mountain, Cape Town has some of South Africa\u2019s highest murder rates, with 3,674 murders recorded in the Western Cape last year, according to police statistics. There is an entrenched gang culture with thousands of young men belonging to street gangs with names such as Hard Living, Sexy Boys and Young Americans. Mapisa-Nqakula said on Wednesday she hoped the army deployment would deter further gang violence. \u201cIt will have to be robust in the beginning to stabilise the situation and have an element of surprise,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Depending on your vintage, you may or may not know what a body is. Or rather what a body was, back in the late 80s, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/01/donna-karans-greatest-fashion-achievements\" title=\"\">Donna Karan</a> came up with a new concept in easy-to-wear, 24-hour, all-black chic, the foundation piece of which was a leotard-like garment with poppers at the crotch. This \u2013 the body \u2013 was a sleek, ridge-free base on to which you could add, say, a black mini and a blazer with shoulder pads.</p> <p>The body is back. Forget worrying about whether to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/01/what-wore-this-week-half-tuck-shirt\" title=\"\">half-tuck</a>, French-tuck or untuck your shirt, because a smooth body or leotard is the new alpha top. It could be a purpose-built body, or it could be a leotard, if your athleisure wardrobe stretches to one of those.</p> <p>Blame the revival of the one-piece over the bikini. A swimsuit can be turned into a daytime holiday outfit with the addition of a pair of shorts, or into an end-of-day cocktail outfit with a long skirt. I\u2019m usually sceptical about the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaEChokAQT8\" title=\"\">how-to-turn-your-picnic-blanket-into-a-cape</a> school of dressing but the logistics of swimming and sunbathing mean holidays are one time when that kind of outfit organically happens.</p> <p>I\u2019m all for looking for ways to get more wear out of your existing wardrobe but, on non-holiday days, something sturdier than a swimsuit is called for.

      "bodyText": "Depending on your vintage, you may or may not know what a body is. Or rather what a body was, back in the late 80s, when Donna Karan came up with a new concept in easy-to-wear, 24-hour, all-black chic, the foundation piece of which was a leotard-like garment with poppers at the crotch. This \u2013 the body \u2013 was a sleek, ridge-free base on to which you could add, say, a black mini and a blazer with shoulder pads. The body is back. Forget worrying about whether to half-tuck, French-tuck or untuck your shirt, because a smooth body or leotard is the new alpha top. It could be a purpose-built body, or it could be a leotard, if your athleisure wardrobe stretches to one of those. Blame the revival of the one-piece over the bikini. A swimsuit can be turned into a daytime holiday outfit with the addition of a pair of shorts, or into an end-of-day cocktail outfit with a long skirt. I\u2019m usually sceptical about the how-to-turn-your-picnic-blanket-into-a-cape school of dressing but the logistics of swimming and sunbathing mean holidays are one time when that kind of outfit organically happens. I\u2019m all for looking for ways to get more wear out of your existing wardrobe but, on non-holiday days, something sturdier than a swimsuit is called for. Specialist dance stores such as Bloch are a useful source of non-flimsy, stay-put leotards but then these, like swimsuits, have the disadvantage of no crotch fastening and life is too short to take your top off every time you need the loo. I\u2019m a big fan of the Heist Outer Body, a bodysuit that I have in petrel blue. Not cheap at \u00a395, but it combines effective shapewear panelling with streamlined styling and comfortable, breathable fabric that isn\u2019t a battle to get into. Also, the all-important crotch fastening isn\u2019t poppers but instead a hook and eye fastening, so you don\u2019t risk that inelegant moment when you reach to get wine glasses down from a high kitchen shelf and your body unpops itself and springs out of your waistband.

      "bodyText": "A care worker and amateur tattooist has been jailed for at least 33 years for murdering a 13-year-old girl after she threatened to reveal that he had been sexually abusing her for more than a year. Stephen Nicholson, 25, a lodger at Lucy McHugh\u2019s family home, lured the teenager into woods in Hampshire and stabbed her 27 times before hiding the weapon and trying to burn the clothes he had been wearing. During his sentencing hearing at Winchester crown court the judge, Mrs Justice May, questioned why social services had not stepped in even though concerns had been raised over Lucy. It also emerged that Nicholson had been detained as a teenager for holding staff and youngsters at a children\u2019s home hostage at knifepoint and was later given a further sentence for trying to stab a detention officer. Jailing Nicholson for life, Mrs Justice May said Lucy was vulnerable and \u201ceasy prey\u201d. She said an image of Lucy caught on CCTV before she went to meet him was heartbreaking, and described the attack as \u201cparticularly ferocious and brutal\u201d. Detectives believe Nicholson carefully plotted the murder, characterised in court as an \u201cexecution\u201d, to silence Lucy, and meticulously planned his attempt to get away with it. After Lucy vanished, Nicholson sent her mother an apparently supportive message in which he told her to keep her chin up and coolly got on with a DIY project to convert a shed into a house for his pet snakes, which included a 2.7-metre (9ft) boa constrictor. May told him: \u201cThis was a pitiless attack on a child following months of sexual exploitation.\u201d She added: \u201cLucy was described as bright, bubbly, intelligent and eager to learn.

It appears that no action was taken. The judge said: \u201cThe question is how social services could have arrived at that conclusion not once but twice given what Lucy had told friends and what Nicholson has been convicted of.\u201d William Mousley QC, prosecuting, told the court that Nicholson had been sentenced when he was 14 to two years for holding staff and youngsters at a children\u2019s home hostage at knifepoint. While under the influence of amphetamines, he took both adult staff members hostage and held a knife to the throat of a female worker before corralling the youngsters into the same room. Mousley added: \u201cHe said he was intoxicated and experienced a feeling of power when he committed the offences.\u201d The prosecutor said that Nicholson was given a further year\u2019s detention when he barricaded himself into a canteen at a young offender institution with three other inmates. He said that Nicholson \u201ctried to stab a staff member\u201d and explained he launched the disturbance as a form of protest against the terms of his release. The case has also focused attention on how difficult it is to obtain details of Facebook messages even following the most serious of crimes.

Under the clownish charlatan due to succeed her \u2013 drunk on rightwing populism, English nationalism, messianic delusion and Conservative existential angst \u2013 it is now a tangible possibility.</p> <p>It may not happen. Boris Johnson isn\u2019t really trusted by anyone \u2013 probably not even by himself \u2013 and the Brexiteer ultras are braced for another great betrayal. Perhaps he will risk their wrath by opting for an indefinite transition period. But a potential national emergency is just 104 days away \u2013 one that will lead to a humbled government clawing its way back to the negotiating table in an even more diminished position. And that\u2019s why Labour, as a matter of urgency, must launch a nationwide all-out campaign against no deal.</p> <p>All is not well with Team Labour. Brexit has sapped the morale of the grassroots, caused divisions at the top of the party, and led to a substantial chunk of its 2017 electoral coalition to defect \u2013 for now\u2013 to the Greens and Liberal Democrats. The Labour right scents blood, and \u2013 even as the hard right are in the ascendancy \u2013 plans to throttle the leadership and its allies.

As two leadership campaigns and a general election testify, Corbyn is best on the stump. He should position himself at the head of a national Stop No Deal movement, travelling the country and addressing mass rallies.

      "bodyText": "Off a cliff they march: bowler hat-wearing, besuited Englishmen, left leg raised theatrically \u2013 \u00e0 la Ministry of Silly Walks \u2013 over the precipice before they topple into the abyss. This was the front-cover image of the New Yorker sketched in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum result, but it surely even better captures our current predicament. Sing it gently: It\u2019s Beginning to Look a Lot Like No Deal. Under Theresa May, this was always an empty threat, even though she paved its way with her inflammatory declaration that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. Under the clownish charlatan due to succeed her \u2013 drunk on rightwing populism, English nationalism, messianic delusion and Conservative existential angst \u2013 it is now a tangible possibility. It may not happen. Boris Johnson isn\u2019t really trusted by anyone \u2013 probably not even by himself \u2013 and the Brexiteer ultras are braced for another great betrayal. Perhaps he will risk their wrath by opting for an indefinite transition period. But a potential national emergency is just 104 days away \u2013 one that will lead to a humbled government clawing its way back to the negotiating table in an even more diminished position. And that\u2019s why Labour, as a matter of urgency, must launch a nationwide all-out campaign against no deal. All is not well with Team Labour. Brexit has sapped the morale of the grassroots, caused divisions at the top of the party, and led to a substantial chunk of its 2017 electoral coalition to defect \u2013 for now\u2013 to the Greens and Liberal Democrats. The Labour right scents blood, and \u2013 even as the hard right are in the ascendancy \u2013 plans to throttle the leadership and its allies. Writing in the Spectator, the journalist Isabel Hardman claimed: \u201cLabour plotters are terrified that if they fail to act before an election they might end up with something even worse than a Boris Johnson victory: Corbyn himself becoming prime minister.\u201d For any Labour MP to prefer what will be the most extreme Tory government in the era of universal suffrage over their own leader forming a government \u2013 well, what is there even to say? Labour has pivoted to a pro-referendum-and-remain stance, but that\u2019s insufficient: it hasn\u2019t really built on it. As two leadership campaigns and a general election testify, Corbyn is best on the stump. He should position himself at the head of a national Stop No Deal movement, travelling the country and addressing mass rallies. Labour should call a national demonstration and organise local mobilisations in towns and cities. There should be billboards and dropdown banners splashed across urban landscapes; national and local media should be bombarded with Stop No Deal messaging, married to Labour\u2019s referendum commitment. If \u2013 despite this week\u2019s vote by MPs \u2013 Johnson manages to stop parliament sitting to ensure no deal, Labour must call it what it is, a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, and call for the people to occupy the House of Commons and demand an immediate general election. Labour should be clear: a national emergency beckons in the form of a ruinous exit from the EU fused with an ultra-Thatcherite assault on the economy, welfare state, and workers\u2019 rights. It must be stopped. Rather than just being a campaign against something, Labour should use such a movement to put its progressive domestic agenda front and centre, presenting it as a cure for the ills of austerity that led Britain to this crisis. It could be presented as a campaign to save industry, to appeal to swing voters in key seats, too. Other than the Kate Hoey-type fringe, such a campaign would unite the party. Anti-Corbyn elements would still plot, but they would be marginalised and undermined. The magic of the 2017 election campaign would re-emerge, and those whose Brexit frustration has led them to leave the Labour fold would surely return.

The Armed Men are giant puppets made from bits of the hotel heating system, and we know the Queen of the Night is coming because of the whirr and clank of ancient machinery \u2013 nothing good ever came out of an onstage lift. Yet Caroline Wettergreen\u2019s elegant Queen, with even more stratospheric high notes than normal, is ambiguous, even sympathetic. By contrast, though he may sound gloriously deep and velvety, Brindley Sherratt\u2019s Sarastro and his band of self-important chefs are ridiculous from the start (and having one of the chorus feign dwarfism feels wrong). Perhaps their Tenniel-esque costumes represent the first tiny puncture in the balloon of Mozart and Schikaneder\u2019s serious intentions; by the end, that balloon is zooming and flapping all around us, as Papagena pushes out baby after baby and Tamino, winningly sung by David Portillo, wins his stripes just by doing the washing-up. The ending is serious but feels lightweight. In the pit, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment bring period-instrument texture and shapeliness to the score, but it can feel as if conductor Ryan Wigglesworth is looking up at a different production, one that\u2019s solid and conventional, not the witty, irrepressible, unforgettable one on stage. At Glyndebourne, Lewes, until 24 August.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>One more thing to tick off my bucket list. England\u2019s men have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">won a cricket </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">World </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-win-cricket-world-cup-and-for-once-the-nation-really-was-watching\">Cup final</a> at the fourth time of asking. I can die just a little less unhappy. But God it was stressful. We were staying with friends in Somerset and I watched the first six hours planted in front of the TV. Then, at about five in the afternoon, with England struggling on about 100-4 and the overs ticking by, my wife said it was time for us to leave to go back to London. And I didn\u2019t put up a fight. In fact I was grateful. I couldn\u2019t take it any more, as I was convinced that all the next few hours had in store was an inexorable slide to a narrow defeat and that I would have contributed to the loss by having stayed to watch it. I couldn\u2019t even listen to the game on the radio on the journey home as I was too tense. So as my wife dozed I half-heartedly listened to Radio 4, making sure to switch off for every news bulletin, and just willed the clock to tick past to a time when the match would definitely be over. Then I could switch on, get the result and deal with the disappointment. It didn\u2019t quite work out that way. I held out until about 7.30pm and then I noticed I had a text from a friend saying \u2018Incredible match\u2019. Assuming this must mean it was over and that England had won, I turned on the radio to find that New Zealand required two runs from the final ball of the super over. The best laid plans ... Somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jul/14/england-beat-new-zealand-in-lords-epic-to-win-their-first-cricket-world-cup-video-report\">England and I got over the line</a>. After a few tears of joy, my main feeling was relief. The good stuff is always so fleeting with me. If we\u2019d lost, I\u2019d still be depressed.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>You can tell quite a lot about the state of any leadership campaign from who turns up to the spin room. For the final Sun-TalkRadio head-to-head <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/hunt-and-johnson-the-backstop-is-dead-and-cant-be-in-any-eu-deal\">debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt</a>, Dominic Raab from Team Boris had arrived long before the start and could not have been more charming. When he was both Brexit secretary and challenging for the leadership himself, Raab was a knot of barely repressed anger and looked like a man hoping no one would find out about his eight road rage convictions. Now he was Mr Smiley, happy to take the piss out of himself and looking every bit the man who wasn\u2019t expecting to be taking public transport for much longer. This time next week he will be back in the cabinet. Twenty minutes before the debate began I asked if he could save us both a bit of time and tell me now why Boris had easily won the debate. For a moment, he even looked tempted. Tellingly, only one MP, Steve Brine, from Team Hunt made an appearance, and he only made it to the spin room about halfway through. Probably just as well, as Hunt already appeared to have conceded he\u2019d lost and was more interested in not pissing Johnson off and was pitching for a job in his cabinet. Moments before the debate ended, Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel from Team Boris swanned into the room to authoritatively declare their man to have delivered all the killer lines, despite not having heard any of them. There\u2019s going to be a lot of disappointed faces when the jobs are divvied up next week.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>The election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/who-is-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-new-eu-commission-president\">Ursula von der Leyen</a> as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/16/ursula-von-der-leyen-elected-first-female-european-commission-president\">new president of the European Commission</a> drew a predictably snarky response from the Brexit party. Nigel Farage tweeted: \u201cUrsula von der Leyen has scraped in by nine votes. Power but no legitimacy,\u201d while MEP Claire Fox was similarly appalled. \u201cJeez \u2013 standing ovation for #UrsulaVonDerLeyen who won in an election against herself by \u2013 wait for it \u2013 9 votes. Craven,\u201d she tweeted. As it happened, Von der Leyen won almost exactly 52% of the vote, a result that the Brexit party normally describe as an overwhelming majority but which on this occasion was treated as the narrowest of narrow victories. The Brexiters\u2019 other objection \u2013 that there was no one standing against Von der Leyen \u2013 seemed almost as wilfully dim. The vote was actually a ratification of a decision previously taken by the 28 EU leaders and if Von der Leyen had not achieved the necessary votes then she would not have got the job and the EU would have had to begin the process of choosing a new president all over again. So although there was no other candidate on the ballot, every vote still counted. All of which was rather more democratic than the Brexit party\u2019s election of its own leader which basically consisted of Farage declaring himself as leader after his predecessor disqualified herself by being outed as a racist. No one in the Brexit party even got to ratify Farage\u2019s appointment. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fb950550b8b476c01d4f19a2f3c0ea822cf14ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fb950550b8b476c01d4f19a2f3c0ea822cf14ec/0_743_11013_6608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Beckett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel Beckett: if only he had moisturised.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>A mental health warning. If you are under 50, then the FaceApp feature that ages you by about 25 years can be quite a laugh. I\u2019ve used it on a couple of friends at work and it made them look rather distinguished and wholly recognisable in comparison to how they are now. Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. Well not much, anyway. It\u2019s a completely different story when you\u2019re the wrong side of 60, though. At least it was in my case. I tried it out of curiosity and am now rather regretting it. If the app is in any way accurate, my old age is going to be no fun at all. The picture that emerged made Samuel Beckett look like a poster boy for someone who had spent his whole life moisturising. My whole face appeared to have collapsed in on itself and was just a mass of blotches and saggy, deep crevasses. Curiously, my ears also seemed to have almost entirely disappeared. Presumably to prevent me from hearing the screams of terror from young children when I venture outdoors. Assuming my legs are still working and I can actually walk. It was a genuinely disturbing experience. I\u2019ve seen healthier looking corpses. I tried showing the picture to my wife but she refused point blank. She finds the person I have become over the last 35 years disappointing enough and would rather not know what horrors are yet to come.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>As Boris Johnson prepares to move into Downing Street, the old guard has spent the week trying to protect their legacies. Such as they are. As almost none of her Conservative MPs now bother to turn up to hear her at prime minister\u2019s questions any more, Theresa May has had to go out and about making policy announcements on social issues that would probably have got a better hearing if she had made them several years ago when she had a chance to make a difference. She also made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/17/theresa-may-hits-out-at-populists-in-farewell-speech\">one of the most bizarre farewell speeches </a>at Chatham House, in which she lamented the lack of compromise and teamwork in modern politics. It rather sounded as if she was talking to herself. Chris Grayling, who has redefined the meaning of uselessness during his years in cabinet, chose to mark his last outing on the government front benches at transport questions by remaining almost entirely silent, letting junior ministers do almost all the talking instead. A tactic he should probably have employed earlier in his career. Philip Hammond, meanwhile, has been treating Twitter as his personal liveblog as he rubbishes every claim Johnson makes about a no-deal Brexit having no economic consequences. I\u2019m fairly certain that May, Grayling and Hammond won\u2019t miss me, but I will miss them. Three years ago, I had no idea they would provide such great material for me. And despair for the country. Still, I\u2019m fairly confident that what\u2019s to come will be even worse. So bring them on. I refuse to be taken even further down without a good laugh.</p> <p><strong>Digested week: Boris Johnson experiences his first defeat in the </strong><strong>Commons before he\u2019s even prime minister.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b62ca05beb1ef41838f0554cc7c945e2b6ac58bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b62ca05beb1ef41838f0554cc7c945e2b6ac58bf/0_154_3974_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris with fish: \u2018Believe in the red, white and blue kipper\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris with fish: \u2018Believe in the red, white and blue kipper\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ec06ca7a4c28e33c670440eadd10192e104fca7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec06ca7a4c28e33c670440eadd10192e104fca7/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dinosaur: \u2018We have a bright future ahead of us\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dinosaur: \u2018We have a bright future ahead of us\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Monday One more thing to tick off my bucket list. England\u2019s men have won a cricket World Cup final at the fourth time of asking. I can die just a little less unhappy. But God it was stressful. We were staying with friends in Somerset and I watched the first six hours planted in front of the TV. Then, at about five in the afternoon, with England struggling on about 100-4 and the overs ticking by, my wife said it was time for us to leave to go back to London. And I didn\u2019t put up a fight. In fact I was grateful. I couldn\u2019t take it any more, as I was convinced that all the next few hours had in store was an inexorable slide to a narrow defeat and that I would have contributed to the loss by having stayed to watch it. I couldn\u2019t even listen to the game on the radio on the journey home as I was too tense. So as my wife dozed I half-heartedly listened to Radio 4, making sure to switch off for every news bulletin, and just willed the clock to tick past to a time when the match would definitely be over. Then I could switch on, get the result and deal with the disappointment. It didn\u2019t quite work out that way. I held out until about 7.30pm and then I noticed I had a text from a friend saying \u2018Incredible match\u2019. Assuming this must mean it was over and that England had won, I turned on the radio to find that New Zealand required two runs from the final ball of the super over. The best laid plans ... Somehow England and I got over the line. After a few tears of joy, my main feeling was relief. The good stuff is always so fleeting with me. If we\u2019d lost, I\u2019d still be depressed. Tuesday You can tell quite a lot about the state of any leadership campaign from who turns up to the spin room. For the final Sun-TalkRadio head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab from Team Boris had arrived long before the start and could not have been more charming. When he was both Brexit secretary and challenging for the leadership himself, Raab was a knot of barely repressed anger and looked like a man hoping no one would find out about his eight road rage convictions. Now he was Mr Smiley, happy to take the piss out of himself and looking every bit the man who wasn\u2019t expecting to be taking public transport for much longer. This time next week he will be back in the cabinet. Twenty minutes before the debate began I asked if he could save us both a bit of time and tell me now why Boris had easily won the debate. For a moment, he even looked tempted. Tellingly, only one MP, Steve Brine, from Team Hunt made an appearance, and he only made it to the spin room about halfway through. Probably just as well, as Hunt already appeared to have conceded he\u2019d lost and was more interested in not pissing Johnson off and was pitching for a job in his cabinet. Moments before the debate ended, Iain Duncan Smith and Priti Patel from Team Boris swanned into the room to authoritatively declare their man to have delivered all the killer lines, despite not having heard any of them. There\u2019s going to be a lot of disappointed faces when the jobs are divvied up next week. Wednesday The election of Ursula von der Leyen as the new president of the European Commission drew a predictably snarky response from the Brexit party. Nigel Farage tweeted: \u201cUrsula von der Leyen has scraped in by nine votes. Power but no legitimacy,\u201d while MEP Claire Fox was similarly appalled. \u201cJeez \u2013 standing ovation for #UrsulaVonDerLeyen who won in an election against herself by \u2013 wait for it \u2013 9 votes. Craven,\u201d she tweeted. As it happened, Von der Leyen won almost exactly 52% of the vote, a result that the Brexit party normally describe as an overwhelming majority but which on this occasion was treated as the narrowest of narrow victories. The Brexiters\u2019 other objection \u2013 that there was no one standing against Von der Leyen \u2013 seemed almost as wilfully dim. The vote was actually a ratification of a decision previously taken by the 28 EU leaders and if Von der Leyen had not achieved the necessary votes then she would not have got the job and the EU would have had to begin the process of choosing a new president all over again. So although there was no other candidate on the ballot, every vote still counted. All of which was rather more democratic than the Brexit party\u2019s election of its own leader which basically consisted of Farage declaring himself as leader after his predecessor disqualified herself by being outed as a racist. No one in the Brexit party even got to ratify Farage\u2019s appointment. Thursday A mental health warning. If you are under 50, then the FaceApp feature that ages you by about 25 years can be quite a laugh. I\u2019ve used it on a couple of friends at work and it made them look rather distinguished and wholly recognisable in comparison to how they are now. Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. Well not much, anyway. It\u2019s a completely different story when you\u2019re the wrong side of 60, though. At least it was in my case. I tried it out of curiosity and am now rather regretting it. If the app is in any way accurate, my old age is going to be no fun at all. The picture that emerged made Samuel Beckett look like a poster boy for someone who had spent his whole life moisturising. My whole face appeared to have collapsed in on itself and was just a mass of blotches and saggy, deep crevasses. Curiously, my ears also seemed to have almost entirely disappeared. Presumably to prevent me from hearing the screams of terror from young children when I venture outdoors. Assuming my legs are still working and I can actually walk. It was a genuinely disturbing experience. I\u2019ve seen healthier looking corpses. I tried showing the picture to my wife but she refused point blank. She finds the person I have become over the last 35 years disappointing enough and would rather not know what horrors are yet to come. Friday As Boris Johnson prepares to move into Downing Street, the old guard has spent the week trying to protect their legacies. Such as they are. As almost none of her Conservative MPs now bother to turn up to hear her at prime minister\u2019s questions any more, Theresa May has had to go out and about making policy announcements on social issues that would probably have got a better hearing if she had made them several years ago when she had a chance to make a difference. She also made one of the most bizarre farewell speeches at Chatham House, in which she lamented the lack of compromise and teamwork in modern politics. It rather sounded as if she was talking to herself. Chris Grayling, who has redefined the meaning of uselessness during his years in cabinet, chose to mark his last outing on the government front benches at transport questions by remaining almost entirely silent, letting junior ministers do almost all the talking instead. A tactic he should probably have employed earlier in his career. Philip Hammond, meanwhile, has been treating Twitter as his personal liveblog as he rubbishes every claim Johnson makes about a no-deal Brexit having no economic consequences. I\u2019m fairly certain that May, Grayling and Hammond won\u2019t miss me, but I will miss them. Three years ago, I had no idea they would provide such great material for me. And despair for the country. Still, I\u2019m fairly confident that what\u2019s to come will be even worse. So bring them on. I refuse to be taken even further down without a good laugh. Digested week: Boris Johnson experiences his first defeat in the Commons before he\u2019s even prime minister.",

A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/13/problem-gamblers-at-15-times-higher-risk-of-suicide-study-finds\">more recent study by Swedish researchers</a> also identified a link between problem gambling and suicide but used slightly different criteria.</p> <p>Using data from people who were diagnosed with a severe gambling disorder and later took killed themselves, the study found that among addicts the risk of suicide was 15 times higher.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \u201cEvery suicide is a tragedy, and we are absolutely committed to protecting vulnerable people from the risks of gambling-related harm. We secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will see a 10-fold increase in funding towards treatment and support for problem gamblers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the past year, we have also introduced a wave of tougher measures to protect vulnerable people, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling, and expanding national specialist support through the NHS long-term plan\u201d.<br></p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

The elevated risk remained even when correcting for other contributing factors that might be linked to suicidal thoughts, such as depression, substance abuse and financial problems. Stripping out such factors, the researchers found that problem gamblers were still three times more likely to consider or attempt suicide. Nearly one in five, or 19%, had considered suicide in the past year, compared with 4.1% of the general population, while 4.7% attempted suicide, compared with 0.6% in the wider population. The report\u2019s co-author, Dr Heather Wardle, assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the report\u2019s findings should trigger swifter action to protect addicts, particularly within the industry. \u201cThe harms from gambling are profound and can be devastating for individuals, families and communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThese results show how people with gambling problems are a higher risk group for suicidality.\u201d \u201cThe people on the frontline of dealing with this high-risk group are the industry, who need to think about how they train staff potentially having interactions with suicidal people. They need to ensure those staff will put the wellbeing of people above profit.\u201d Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the charity Gambling With Lives after their son Jack killed himself at the age of 24 while addicted to gambling, said the study demonstrated the need for tougher action from government. The Ritchies are seeking to have the government held legally liable for their son\u2019s death, blaming lax regulation of the industry. \u201cOverall the research confirms our own estimates from our assessment of international research that there are hundreds of gambling-related suicides every year in the UK,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is now time for the government, regulators and the industry to address this serious issue and make gambling safer for everyone.\u201d The Ritchie family are calling for a ban on gambling advertising, particularly the direct marketing emails that companies send to customers typically offering \u201cfree\u201d bets or other offers. Direct marketing has been a factor in multiple cases in which betting firms have been accused of failing to intervene when addicts lose money rapidly. Gambling With Lives, whose members include parents whose children killed themselves after becoming addicted to gambling, also called for a mandatory levy on gambling firms to fund addiction treatment. Major firms in the industry recently offered to increase the amount they pay to \u00a360m but said such a levy would be voluntary and would apply only to the five largest betting companies. The Ritchies have also called for gambling products to undergo rigorous safety testing before they can be released on to the market. The GambleAware study used data from 2007 based on a survey of gamblers in England, due to a lack of more recently harvested information. A more recent study by Swedish researchers also identified a link between problem gambling and suicide but used slightly different criteria. Using data from people who were diagnosed with a severe gambling disorder and later took killed themselves, the study found that among addicts the risk of suicide was 15 times higher. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \u201cEvery suicide is a tragedy, and we are absolutely committed to protecting vulnerable people from the risks of gambling-related harm. We secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will see a 10-fold increase in funding towards treatment and support for problem gamblers.\u201d \u201cIn the past year, we have also introduced a wave of tougher measures to protect vulnerable people, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling, and expanding national specialist support through the NHS long-term plan\u201d. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org",

On Thursday, Tim Whittingham, from Somerset, said his \u201cjaw dropped\u201d when he saw a boat he had sold on eBay being used by Extinction Rebellion outside the Royal Courts of Justice. On Friday afternoon, a small group of protesters in Manchester locked and glued themselves to railings outside the Greater Manchester Pension Fund\u2019s offices to demand it withdraw investments from fossil fuel companies. One, identified as Joel in a video on social media, graffitied the words \u201cstop funding climate genocide\u201d in red spray paint along the building. Earlier protesters blockaded the entrance to the construction of London\u2019s \u00a34.2bn super-sewer project as part of a fifth day of protests. About 50 activists \u2013 including mothers and children from the nearby Riverside primary school \u2013 began a blockade to halt concrete pouring at Chambers Wharf in Bermondsey, south-east London, at 7.30am on Friday. The movement argues that the continuous traffic and parking of mixing concrete lorries at one of the main sites for building the Thames Tideway tunnel will cause a huge amount of air pollution. Heather Mulkerrins, 31, who is protesting at the site with her four children \u2013 three of whom have asthma \u2013 said she was there to \u201cprotect our children \u2026 I am worried about all the dust and pollution from the lorries\u201d.

Others gathered outside the City of London magistrates court on Friday morning in a show of support for 50 activists who have been charged after taking part in protests. Sixteen Extinction Rebellion protesters were arrested in Bristol on Wednesday after they blocked a main road leading to the M32 motorway. On Wednesday, a man told BBC Radio Bristol he had been unable to get to the city\u2019s Royal Infirmary before his father died because of the blockade. In a statement, the movement said: \u201cIt is with deep regret that we hear of the serious emotional impact on several individuals caught in traffic resulting from one of our protests in Bristol.

      "body": "<p>Everyone in the UK is a friendless loser. Not my words, but those (slightly paraphrased) of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/jun/25/why-do-britons-have-fewer-close-friends-than-people-in-any-other-country\" title=\"\">a recent Snapchat survey</a> that found British people have fewer close mates than other nationalities. With 2.6 \u201cbest friends\u201d on average, compared with the frankly excessive 6.6 boasted by participants in Saudi Arabia, and one in seven of us reporting no best friends at all, the results paint a damning portrait of a seemingly lonely populace. A nation of Briton-no-mates.</p> <p>Mind you, <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601369/your-brain-limits-you-to-just-five-bffs/\" title=\"\">new research</a> by MIT reckons humans can only cope with a maximum of five close friends, so we wouldn\u2019t know what to do with more even if we had them. These findings corroborate 1990s research by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who suggested a correlation between brain size and social relationships. In other words: humans are only capable of having a finite number of people in our social sphere at any given time, because we\u2019re all a bunch of numpties. Now, I\u2019m no scientist, but based on how dramatically my stress levels spike whenever I receive more than one text message before 11am, I\u2019d say that checks out.</p> <p>Despite being a significant cornerstone of a healthy social life, friends can be strangely transitory. From our first encounters in infant school, when we bond over crayons and crisps, to agonising encounters in our 20s, when we bond over sexual attraction and hating the same people on Twitter, the makeup of our social circles will change in accordance with how we \u2013 hopefully \u2013 evolve as individuals.</p> <p>That first core group becomes a rotating cast. Some may remain as key protagonists, others are recurring characters, and there will inevitably be many, many regrettable cameos. But in these fraught, isolationist times, let us take a moment to consider our mates. Who are they and what can they tell us about ourselves?</p> <h2><strong>School </strong><strong>friends</strong></h2> <p>Our first comrade of convenience, the School Friend enters our life before we\u2019ve had time to develop a personality. This is especially cruel because these are also our most formative years, so everyone remembers everything. Think of all the names you still know in full, the faces you remember, the houses you can still picture, the girl you were briefly close with in year 5 because you got put in maths together and spent the entire class trying to see how many dicks you could draw on a rubber \u2013 and then basically never spoke to again. Mad, really, how GCSE results day isn\u2019t also accompanied by a gracious ceremony in which everyone has their memory erased, Men In Black-style. Seems like an oversight.</p> <p>Once you do start to find yourself, these early connections go one of three ways: you drift apart in secondary school and never hear about them again until your mum bumps into their mum in Sainsbury\u2019s; you stay friends long enough to have each other on Facebook, where you occasionally like photos of their baby; or you stay friends for ever, know them best of anyone in the world, and are ultimately tasked with delivering a thoughtful but humorous eulogy at their funeral, during which you break the tension by calling them an \u201cold git\u201d for dying first.</p> <h2><strong>Work </strong><strong>friends</strong></h2> <p>You see them the most, talk to them the most and have the most in-jokes with them because you spend eight hours a day, five days a week together in the same shipping container office space/on Slack/behind a bar.

They\u2019re clued up on the tedious minutiae of your life \u2013 what aesthetic you\u2019re feeling at the moment, what mood you were in at 6.19pm last Tuesday, how you couldn\u2019t have a burrito for lunch because the place around the corner from your office was closed for some reason.

At certain points, you might even call them your closest friend.</p> <p>Until you meet them, that is. Never do that.</p> <h2><strong>Uni </strong><strong>mates</strong></h2> <p>University is a microcycle of your entire life in friendships. You spend the first year talking to everyone, throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks. By the second year, you might have two or three different socials circles that overlap, Venn diagram-like, containing people you like to varying degrees.</p> <p>By the third year, you can\u2019t be arsed. By now, there are about four people on the entire campus you get on with, and you\u2019re too tired to keep putting in work with the rest. The likelihood of those four people genuinely enjoying each other\u2019s company is even slimmer, so you spend the last 12 months of your degree either enjoying one-on-one hangouts, or going out in massive groups of people whose names you\u2019ll struggle to remember when tagging your graduation photos.</p> <p>Alternatively, if you\u2019re more socially forgiving, you will end up being added to a 23-strong WhatsApp group called \u201cYOU-NEH [beer emoji]\u201d that pops off a few times a year whenever someone floats the concept of meeting up \u2013 which, of course, you never do.</p> <h2><strong>Frenemies</strong></h2> <p>Too many of us feel compelled to stick around people we don\u2019t like simply because they\u2019ve been there for ages, or we did, at one point, consider them a friend \u2013 but frankly, life\u2019s too short for that. If you\u2019re fundamentally at odds with someone, stop forcing those awkward monthly catch-ups at Costa, the ones that end with a Kardashian-style barny because you said something uncomplimentary about their new squeeze, and cut them out. Who has the time?</p> <p>Equally, though \u2013 is there any greater driving force for success than hatred? Do the achievements of a frenemy not spur you to greater heights? Do your own achievements not then feel even sweeter? Ultimately, a frenemy\u2019s value is dependent on how you fare on bitterness and competition. If the answer is \u201cI thrive\u201d, then these might be the greatest relationships of your life. Why do you think Fleetwood Mac were so successful?</p> <h2><strong>Background </strong><strong>friends</strong></h2> <p>Twitter user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/queentrashcan/status/1139660168348819456\" title=\"\">@queentrashcan</a> recently defined the background friend in a viral post, which read: \u201ci don\u2019t fit in with any particular group of friends. they all are closer with each other and i sometimes link on but am permanent with no one. i think about all these people constantly but i don\u2019t think i cross their minds often.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Who has not, in the toilet at a party, worried if you died tomorrow, no one knows your favourite song is Californication</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Basically the concept is: a lone wolf who has no established friendship group. This is someone you always say hello to on a night out, ask who they\u2019re with, then realise it\u2019s you. While you have nothing but good things to say about this person, you rarely invite them anywhere because someone else always seems to. Everyone assumes the background friend is better friends with someone else, while the background friend themselves is elusive; familiar to many groups, but a key player in none.

People are emotionally stunted and rarely vocalise what other people mean to them, so I would argue that the background friend is a state of mind more often than it is an identity. Then again, who among us has not had a quiet moment in the toilet at a house party, thousand-yard staring into the cabinet mirror, worrying that, if you died tomorrow, there might be no one who knows your favourite song is Californication.</p> <h2><strong>Playgroup </strong><strong>pals</strong></h2> <p>There are some notable downsides to being a new parent: the temporary dip in sexual activity, sleep deprivation, having to raise a healthy, happy baby in the context of humanity\u2019s uncertain future on our rapidly dying planet. But the worst has to be taking your kid to playgroup and having to talk to other parents. And so, for a time, you will spend several hours a week listening to Karen talk about getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/06/healthandwellbeing.relaxation33\" title=\"\">reiki</a> for her swollen feet, and you will smile politely, and say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting\u201d even if it isn\u2019t, because she\u2019s the only adult company you\u2019ve had all week.</p> <p>These are the ultimate in circumstantial friends \u2013 like partners of friends, or the relatives of long-term partners, whom you must accept as your own, despite having nothing in common.</p> <h2><strong>Best friends</strong></h2> <p>Best friends comprise the most fulfilling, longstanding and volatile relationships of your life. These are the legends who will support you unequivocally when you\u2019re going through a rough time, but will also tell you when you\u2019re behaving like an arsehole or have food in your teeth. Of course, the closer you are, the deeper the arguments \u2013 but, ultimately, these are the smug bastards who know you better than you know yourself. A best friend will listen to your worst thoughts and not judge. A best friend will rib you when you need humbling, and cook for you when you\u2019re down in the dumps. Most importantly though, a best friend will let you post a photo on Instagram in which you look great but they look truly awful, because they know you\u2019re trying to pull someone.

      "bodyText": "Everyone in the UK is a friendless loser. Not my words, but those (slightly paraphrased) of a recent Snapchat survey that found British people have fewer close mates than other nationalities. With 2.6 \u201cbest friends\u201d on average, compared with the frankly excessive 6.6 boasted by participants in Saudi Arabia, and one in seven of us reporting no best friends at all, the results paint a damning portrait of a seemingly lonely populace. A nation of Briton-no-mates. Mind you, new research by MIT reckons humans can only cope with a maximum of five close friends, so we wouldn\u2019t know what to do with more even if we had them. These findings corroborate 1990s research by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who suggested a correlation between brain size and social relationships. In other words: humans are only capable of having a finite number of people in our social sphere at any given time, because we\u2019re all a bunch of numpties. Now, I\u2019m no scientist, but based on how dramatically my stress levels spike whenever I receive more than one text message before 11am, I\u2019d say that checks out. Despite being a significant cornerstone of a healthy social life, friends can be strangely transitory. From our first encounters in infant school, when we bond over crayons and crisps, to agonising encounters in our 20s, when we bond over sexual attraction and hating the same people on Twitter, the makeup of our social circles will change in accordance with how we \u2013 hopefully \u2013 evolve as individuals. That first core group becomes a rotating cast. Some may remain as key protagonists, others are recurring characters, and there will inevitably be many, many regrettable cameos. But in these fraught, isolationist times, let us take a moment to consider our mates. Who are they and what can they tell us about ourselves? School friends Our first comrade of convenience, the School Friend enters our life before we\u2019ve had time to develop a personality. This is especially cruel because these are also our most formative years, so everyone remembers everything. Think of all the names you still know in full, the faces you remember, the houses you can still picture, the girl you were briefly close with in year 5 because you got put in maths together and spent the entire class trying to see how many dicks you could draw on a rubber \u2013 and then basically never spoke to again. Mad, really, how GCSE results day isn\u2019t also accompanied by a gracious ceremony in which everyone has their memory erased, Men In Black-style. Seems like an oversight. Once you do start to find yourself, these early connections go one of three ways: you drift apart in secondary school and never hear about them again until your mum bumps into their mum in Sainsbury\u2019s; you stay friends long enough to have each other on Facebook, where you occasionally like photos of their baby; or you stay friends for ever, know them best of anyone in the world, and are ultimately tasked with delivering a thoughtful but humorous eulogy at their funeral, during which you break the tension by calling them an \u201cold git\u201d for dying first. Work friends You see them the most, talk to them the most and have the most in-jokes with them because you spend eight hours a day, five days a week together in the same shipping container office space/on Slack/behind a bar. But, at the same time, they know the least about you. You have a shared language, a veritable buffet of niche references, but they couldn\u2019t tell you how many siblings you have, or how old you are. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for the office email, would they even know your last name? You will have lunch together twice a week for three years until one of you resigns, and then you will never see them again until you bump into them at Latitude, where you have precisely one beer and realise the only thing you had in common was complaining about the work toilets. Sesh friends An extremely shallow, but incredibly pivotal, relationship, the Sesh Friend is the person who, regardless of time or place, can always be relied on to respond to your Bat-Signal text: \u201c\u2019Spoons?\u201d These are people you don\u2019t know on any real level, but still share a wealth of emotional experiences with, always ending up on the same tired sofa at afterparties, watching old Talking Heads performances on YouTube while they describe a podcast they once listened to about doppelg\u00e4ngers. Never underestimate the bonding agent that is cracking open the last Tyskie to share as the sky turns cold. Beyond these semi-deep 5am experiences, you have no involvement with them whatsoever. You have never once met for coffee, would never dream of lending each other money, and the only chats you have outside of the sesh are regarding where to meet for the sesh. Internet friends The Internet Friend is basically the inverse of Sesh Friend; they know everything about you except what you\u2019re actually like. They\u2019re clued up on the tedious minutiae of your life \u2013 what aesthetic you\u2019re feeling at the moment, what mood you were in at 6.19pm last Tuesday, how you couldn\u2019t have a burrito for lunch because the place around the corner from your office was closed for some reason.

But they have no idea about your physical presence, your tics and mannerisms, the geometry of your face cracking into a smile at that gif of a puppy jumping into a bush.

The distance means you often tell them things you might find difficult to say IRL, especially if you spend a lot of time online because you\u2019re struggling in your social life. Whether you met them on Tumblr, in a forum for people with a specific medical condition, or through a zealous appreciation of each other\u2019s crap tweets, the Internet Friend can be a guiding light, offering support from the other side of the world. At certain points, you might even call them your closest friend. Until you meet them, that is. Never do that. Uni mates University is a microcycle of your entire life in friendships.

Turkish-Cypriot chef Selin Kiazim is even more in Ian\u2019s can\u2019t-be-faffed-to-peel camp, but then eastern Mediterranean cooking tends to be a bit more rough and ready than its la-di-da western counterparts. \u201cIt\u2019s such a hassle!\u201d she says at her latest venture, an offshoot of her Shoreditch restaurant Oklava at new London food court Arcade Food Theatre in Centrepoint, which opens on 22 July. She admits very occasionally to peel really big tomatoes for salads \u2013 \u201cI just like the way they absorb the dressing\u201d \u2013 but even then, she\u2019s not obsessive about it: \u201cI just pare them with a little knife, like my grandmother did.\u201d And if you feel you really have to peel your tomatoes, for a sauce or soup, say, Kiazim advocates a typically rustic, no-nonsense approach: \u201cJust cut them in half and grate them on the large holes of a box grater.\u201d You\u2019ll be left with a neat pile of pulp, and life\u2019s way too short to throw a wobbler about the odd bit of skin that may creep through. \u2022 Got a culinary dilemma?

Speaking from Devon, Fiona MacKeown said she hoped her family could move on with their lives.

The fact that it will be gone now is taking a bit of time to sink in really.\u201d \u201cRigorous imprisonment\u201d is defined in the Indian penal code as jail plus hard labour, but the form of work is not specified. At a hearing on Wednesday, the high court in Goa overturned a previous ruling, convicting Samson D\u2019Souza of culpable homicide, criminal assault and outraging a woman\u2019s modesty, providing narcotics to a person with knowledge that it could cause serious harm or death, and destruction of evidence. He was also convicted under the Goa children\u2019s code for not providing a safe environment for a child, according to MacKeown\u2019s lawyer, Vikram Varma. A second man, Placido Carvalho, accused of abetting a crime, had his acquittal upheld. D\u2019Souza\u2019s sentencing follows an 11-year battle for justice led by Scarlett\u2019s mother, who said police made no effort to investigate what had happened, neglecting basic evidence and ignoring her inquires.

It\u2019s 1987, and black FBI agent Marie Mitchell, her career stalled by racism and sexism, is recruited by the CIA as the bait in a honeytrap. The target is Burkina Faso\u2019s president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/06/burkina-fasos-revolutionary-hero-thomas-sankara-to-be-exhumed\" title=\"\">Thomas Sankara</a>, and the aim is to destabilise his fledgling government, whose Marxist leanings run counter to American interests. Despite misgivings, Mitchell accepts the job; once in West Africa, and having become emotionally involved with her subject, she is increasingly ambivalent about what she is doing, and why. Written as a record for her sons after an attempt on her life five years later, this is a complex, powerful story of divided loyalties, double consciousness and moral ambiguity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fe9c6b9e6226bcacc71367124a8345adbdca96ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe9c6b9e6226bcacc71367124a8345adbdca96ac/0_0_1500_2182/687.jpg\" alt=\"The Most Difficult Thing by Charlotte Philby\" width=\"687\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Spy novels by women tend to be few and far between, so it\u2019s an unexpected pleasure when two come along at once.

Anna is besotted with secretive Harry, whose unnamed paymasters are very interested in the unscrupulous business dealings of their mutual friend David\u2019s billionaire father. In order to obtain inside information, Harry encourages Anna into David\u2019s arms, and marriage and children follow.

The technique of the chain letter is employed: for your child to be freed, you must not only pay a ransom but also kidnap somebody else\u2019s kid to continue the sequence, and the consequences for anyone who refuses to cooperate are brutal. It is, as one of its architects says, \u201cThe goddamn Uber of kidnapping with the clients doing most of the work themselves.\u201d When 13-year-old Kylie is snatched from a bus stop near her home in Massachusetts, her mother is plunged into a nightmare as she is forced to do the unthinkable in order to save her daughter.

Only 20-year-old Romy and a few of the children, including her two half-siblings (the leader has cherry-picked the most attractive women as sexual partners), have survived. The action flips between past and present as Romy struggles to understand the \u201cDead\u201d \u2013 as the cult calls people in the outside world \u2013 and searches for the sister of her (really dead) mother. Romy\u2019s aunt Sarah provides a parallel narrative; herself the product of a bizarre Christian sect, she is coming to terms with the strange nephew and niece that social services have foisted on her. Intelligently assimilated research, a slow build with a growing sense of unease and a chillingly believable plotline add up to the best sort of dark psychological thriller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea73b9909c5d9a3f627a26c0e99bcbf552abe113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea73b9909c5d9a3f627a26c0e99bcbf552abe113/0_0_345_500/345.jpg\" alt=\"The Reunion by Guillaume Musso\" width=\"345\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Although Guillaume Musso has topped the book charts in his native France for some years, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/reunion-9781474611206.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><strong>The Reunion</strong></a> (translated by Frank Wynne, W&amp;N, \u00a314.99) is the first of his novels to be published in the UK.

      "bodyText": "If your idea of a cold war thriller is a \u201cwhite saviour\u201d hero with conservative values rescuing the world from the Soviet menace, think again: American Spy (Dialogue, \u00a314.99), Lauren Wilkinson\u2019s intelligent and pacy debut set against the background of a real coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, injects new life into this tired formula. It\u2019s 1987, and black FBI agent Marie Mitchell, her career stalled by racism and sexism, is recruited by the CIA as the bait in a honeytrap. The target is Burkina Faso\u2019s president Thomas Sankara, and the aim is to destabilise his fledgling government, whose Marxist leanings run counter to American interests. Despite misgivings, Mitchell accepts the job; once in West Africa, and having become emotionally involved with her subject, she is increasingly ambivalent about what she is doing, and why. Written as a record for her sons after an attempt on her life five years later, this is a complex, powerful story of divided loyalties, double consciousness and moral ambiguity. Spy novels by women tend to be few and far between, so it\u2019s an unexpected pleasure when two come along at once. Charlotte Philby is the granddaughter of double agent Kim Philby; having a spy in the family may be the reason why her first novel, The Most Difficult Thing (Borough, \u00a312.99), is a blend of espionage and domestic suspense. Anna is besotted with secretive Harry, whose unnamed paymasters are very interested in the unscrupulous business dealings of their mutual friend David\u2019s billionaire father. In order to obtain inside information, Harry encourages Anna into David\u2019s arms, and marriage and children follow. Burdened with guilt from her childhood and lacking support, Anna becomes increasingly bewildered. Everyone has an agenda in this intriguing exploration of deceit and duplicity, as Philby rachets up the paranoia to Highsmithian levels. In the hands of a lesser writer, the premise of The Chain (Orion, \u00a312.99) would be preposterous, but Adrian McKinty has invested his conceit of a kidnapping pyramid scheme with an appalling plausibility. The technique of the chain letter is employed: for your child to be freed, you must not only pay a ransom but also kidnap somebody else\u2019s kid to continue the sequence, and the consequences for anyone who refuses to cooperate are brutal. It is, as one of its architects says, \u201cThe goddamn Uber of kidnapping with the clients doing most of the work themselves.\u201d When 13-year-old Kylie is snatched from a bus stop near her home in Massachusetts, her mother is plunged into a nightmare as she is forced to do the unthinkable in order to save her daughter. Told in a spare, punchy style, this is a blazing, full-tilt thriller that entirely justifies the hype. Read, and pass it on. Alex Marwood\u2019s fourth novel, The Poison Garden (Sphere, \u00a312.99), begins with the Jonestown-style massacre of Doomsday cultists who live off-grid in the foothills of Snowdonia. Only 20-year-old Romy and a few of the children, including her two half-siblings (the leader has cherry-picked the most attractive women as sexual partners), have survived. The action flips between past and present as Romy struggles to understand the \u201cDead\u201d \u2013 as the cult calls people in the outside world \u2013 and searches for the sister of her (really dead) mother. Romy\u2019s aunt Sarah provides a parallel narrative; herself the product of a bizarre Christian sect, she is coming to terms with the strange nephew and niece that social services have foisted on her. Intelligently assimilated research, a slow build with a growing sense of unease and a chillingly believable plotline add up to the best sort of dark psychological thriller. Although Guillaume Musso has topped the book charts in his native France for some years, The Reunion (translated by Frank Wynne, W&amp;N, \u00a314.99) is the first of his novels to be published in the UK. In 1992, Vinca Rockwell, an American student at an elite boarding school on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, ran away with her philosophy tutor, Alexis Cl\u00e9ment, and the pair were never seen again. That, at least, is the official version. Her friends know better: and when they attend a reunion 25 years later and discover that the gym is scheduled for demolition, they realise there is trouble ahead \u2026 There\u2019s a cartoonish amount of melodrama as the complicated relationships, tragic misunderstandings, bodies and culprits pile up, but it\u2019s a fun read, spiced with pop-cultural references. Finally, a welcome reissue of a French classic. First published in 1966, The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun by S\u00e9bastien Japrisot (translated by Helen Weaver, Gallic, \u00a38.99) is the fever-dream tale of beautiful Dany, who decides, on a whim, to take her boss\u2019s convertible for a joy ride.

People linger over picnics and wander off to woodland glades, kids kick balls around, soul music washes over us and people emerge from the mansion holding glasses of wine.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a summer function at a stately home but a \u201cnew\u201d municipal park in south-east London, nine miles from Trafalgar Square, on the cusp of its official opening on 20 July. The opening coincides with a week-long festival marking <a href=\"http://www.nationalparkcity.london/\">London becoming a National Park City</a> (20-28 July), a Mayor of London initiative designed to make the capital greener and healthier.</p> <p>So where has all this green space been hiding? Beckenham Place Park was a public golf course for more than 100 years; in the 1990s it was among the busiest 18-hole public courses in London, perhaps Europe. Sporting legends, such as footballer Ian Wright, cut their golfing teeth there, as did less-stellar sports enthusiasts, such as myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c93226e55316642ea852ffcab8c78cb8bd0fd92d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c93226e55316642ea852ffcab8c78cb8bd0fd92d/0_0_5151_3439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mansion in Beckenham Place Park, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To the manor born \u2026 the mansion is already open for drinks and music.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: copelandpark.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in the late 2000s golf seemed to lose its allure and the local authority decided \u2013 amid much protest \u2013 to close the course and restore the park for the benefit of the wider community. As the course died its slow death, dog walkers would roam the fairways. The course finally closed in October 2016.</p> <p>Like many, I assumed new flats and supermarkets would shoot up on the site but this was never Lewisham council\u2019s plan. Now the 96-hectare space, one of London\u2019s largest council-owned parks, has been remoulded as a recreational and natural attraction with the help of around \u00a35m of Heritage Lottery grant. And already it\u2019s attracting greater numbers than previously, drawn by the freedom to roam green spaces, and by the happy ambience at the mansion, with its groovy music, pop-up bar, yoga, arts and crafts, and vinyl store.</p> <p>But the jewel in the park\u2019s crown is the new 283-metre-long, 45-metre-wide lake, a recreation of an original Georgian water feature. Its source, says programme manager Gavin Plaskitt, is a combination of an aquifer reached by a new borehole, ground water and an existing stream. Reeds and other aquatic plants absorb unwanted nutrients in the water and oxygen pumps keep the water, which at its greatest depth is 3.5 metres, healthy. A beach area neatly shelves into shallow water for younger children to splash around in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b4176439d11c72ec9be0179928eeabf7a3abc11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b4176439d11c72ec9be0179928eeabf7a3abc11/0_61_3861_2317/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The swimming lake at Beckenham Park Place, south-east London, which opens on 20 July\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The jewel in the park\u2019s crown - a 283-metre-long swimming lake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edge to Edge Films.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On recent balmy evenings some locals, tired of waiting for the official opening, pushed aside the barriers to take to the inviting water.

East of the lake, a wooded wetland habitat is being created, a rewilding venture aimed at creating a fauna- and flora-rich environment, and boosting biodiversity. A raised path alongside it leads deeper into the woods. \u201cAlready we\u2019ve seen dragonflies, and birds like little egrets turning up,\u201d says Plaskitt, who is now watching his vision of six years ago bearing fruit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e7b93deda43e90e1f65a18dda68903244fc70db8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b93deda43e90e1f65a18dda68903244fc70db8/0_268_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ancient oaks dot the former fairways at Beckenham Place Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ancient oaks dot the former fairways at Beckenham Place Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam McCulloch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout its golf course years, the park was a well-known natural space, carefully tended by the Friends of Beckenham Place Park.

I may still clear the cobwebs from my golf clubs from time to time, but I\u2019ll be needing a decent wetsuit for future visits to the park. \u2022 Book swimming here. More information on events at the mansion at beckenhamplace.org. Beckenham Place Park is on the Green Chain and London Ring walking routes.

Another clambers up a towering ash and seems to take in the view down to the River Severn and and across towards the Forest of Dean.</p> <p>Soon these Eurasian brown bears will be joined by a pack of Eurasian grey wolves and the two species will coexist \u2013 hopefully peacefully \u2013 in this corner of northern Europe for the first time in more than 1,000 years.</p> <p>This is not an ambitious rewilding scheme but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/16/bears-and-wolves-to-coexist-in-uk-woods-in-conservation-project\">a project run by the Bristol Zoological Society</a> to offer a glimpse into what ancient British woodland was like before humans cleared the forests to make room for homes and farms and exterminated some of the spectacular creatures that lived there.</p> <p>The sight of bears and wolves together in one large enclosure will thrill visitors to Bear Wood within Bristol zoo\u2019s Wild Place project but it is also designed to be thought-provoking \u2013 why did our ancestors think it acceptable to wipe out the bear and wolf and could we live with them again in the future?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d529a8fe8755b298eb871fed464979f8719a6a4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d529a8fe8755b298eb871fed464979f8719a6a4d/0_82_4019_2412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eurasian grey wolves\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eurasian grey wolves were hunted to extinction in Britain by the 16th or 17th century.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Christoph Schwitzer, the chief zoological officer, is pleased that even before next week\u2019s public opening, Bear Wood is provoking such debate. The zoo is proud of its conservation projects that range from<a href=\"https://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/save-wildlife/conservation-and-research/western-lowland-gorilla-project\"> trying to bolster gorilla populations in central Africa </a>to reintroducing <a href=\"https://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/save-wildlife/conservation-and-research/white-clawed-crayfish-project\">white-clawed crayfish</a> to the UK.</p> <p>Schwitzer believes there is also a good argument for reintroducing larger creatures such as lynx to remote areas such as the Scottish highlands. \u201cThat may be worth trying. A population of 300 or 400 lynx might be viable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But bears and wolves in England? \u201cThat\u2019s a lot more tricky. There are a lot of factors you need to consider, the first being that we are a heavily populated country.\u201d And human behaviour has not changed over the centuries. \u201cPeople would still go out and kill them,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The opinion is not just theoretical. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/26/animalwelfare.germany\">When a bear nicknamed Bruno wandered into German in 2006 he lasted only seven weeks before being shot by hunters. </a>\u201cPeople were so scared of it; they couldn\u2019t live with it,\u201d said Schwitzer.</p> <p>All of which makes Bear Wood a bittersweet sort of place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d670e846546b0bfdbc08aed085fd763abab09312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d670e846546b0bfdbc08aed085fd763abab09312/0_81_2126_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wolverine at Whipsnade zoo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wolverine at Whipsnade zoo.

They are in separate enclosures so will not come face to face with the larger animals, though they will smell and hear them.</p> <p>The wolverine is a member of the mustelid family that includes badgers, weasels and otters. It too once roamed British woodland before disappearing, presumably hunted for its fur and meat. A handful of wolverine bones have been found in Britain, more than half of them in south-west England and south Wales.</p> <p>Lynx vanished after the wolverine as woodland was chopped down, and next it was the turn of the bear to disappear. Quite when native British bears became extinct is not known. Bears were a familiar sight in Roman and medieval times but they may have been imported.</p> <p>Of the four Bear Wood creatures, only the wolf was left by 1086 and a mere 15% of Britain was covered by woods. Wolves were hunted to extinction by the 16th or 17th century and now only 2% of Britain is covered in ancient woodland.</p> <p>Introducing the bears and wolves to each other will be a delicate process. \u201cYou have to observe rules,\u201d said Schwitzer. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw them in together.\u201d</p> <p>At first the five wolves will be brought into a separate enclosure next to the large one where the four bears are currently roaming so the two species can get used to one another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cbfed8ce9f3f65cc43381890b836e0b0a722b60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cbfed8ce9f3f65cc43381890b836e0b0a722b60/0_0_4780_5975/800.jpg\" alt=\"Two bears climbing a tree\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two of the four bears in Bear Wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Pattenden/Bristol zoo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the keepers judge the time is right the wolves will be allowed into the joint enclosure, though they will be able to retreat without the bears following them if they feel the need.</p> <p>\u201cConflict arises around prey or offspring,\u201d said Schwitzer. So they will feed separately. The three male bears are to be castrated and the five wolves are all males so there will be no breeding and so no young to fight over.</p> <p>The fact that the bears and wolves have a 10,000 sq metre wooded paddock to share should help. They can keep away from each other if they want and interact if the mood takes them.</p> <p>Scientists will also be interested to find out what impact they have on the woodland. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to see how they change the flora and fauna,\u201d said Schwitzer. The squirrels are likely to flee and the bears may clear vegetation, allowing more light-loving plants into the woods. Different invertebrates may move in.</p> <p>It will also be interesting to see how the bears and wolves operate as summer gives way to autumn and winter. It is not clear whether the bears will dig themselves into a den and hibernate.</p> <p>Across the Severn <a href=\"https://www.forestryengland.uk/article/wild-boar-the-forest-dean\">wild boar live wild in the Forest of Dean</a> after accidental and deliberate releases from farms, and a year ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/24/beavers-forest-dean-possible-flooding-solution\">beavers were released into a large pen in the forest </a>as part of a project to alleviate flooding. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/baby-beavers-born-to-englands-first-wild-colony\">Wild beavers have also returned to a river in Devon</a>.

      "bodyText": "On a summer\u2019s day the spot is idyllic. Ancient English woodland tumbles towards the broad river valley. The birds sing, the squirrels scurry. Then suddenly the mood changes as a bear ambles mightily into sight among the oak trees. Another clambers up a towering ash and seems to take in the view down to the River Severn and and across towards the Forest of Dean. Soon these Eurasian brown bears will be joined by a pack of Eurasian grey wolves and the two species will coexist \u2013 hopefully peacefully \u2013 in this corner of northern Europe for the first time in more than 1,000 years. This is not an ambitious rewilding scheme but a project run by the Bristol Zoological Society to offer a glimpse into what ancient British woodland was like before humans cleared the forests to make room for homes and farms and exterminated some of the spectacular creatures that lived there. The sight of bears and wolves together in one large enclosure will thrill visitors to Bear Wood within Bristol zoo\u2019s Wild Place project but it is also designed to be thought-provoking \u2013 why did our ancestors think it acceptable to wipe out the bear and wolf and could we live with them again in the future? Dr Christoph Schwitzer, the chief zoological officer, is pleased that even before next week\u2019s public opening, Bear Wood is provoking such debate. The zoo is proud of its conservation projects that range from trying to bolster gorilla populations in central Africa to reintroducing white-clawed crayfish to the UK. Schwitzer believes there is also a good argument for reintroducing larger creatures such as lynx to remote areas such as the Scottish highlands. \u201cThat may be worth trying. A population of 300 or 400 lynx might be viable,\u201d he said. But bears and wolves in England? \u201cThat\u2019s a lot more tricky. There are a lot of factors you need to consider, the first being that we are a heavily populated country.\u201d And human behaviour has not changed over the centuries. \u201cPeople would still go out and kill them,\u201d he said. The opinion is not just theoretical. When a bear nicknamed Bruno wandered into German in 2006 he lasted only seven weeks before being shot by hunters. \u201cPeople were so scared of it; they couldn\u2019t live with it,\u201d said Schwitzer. All of which makes Bear Wood a bittersweet sort of place. As well as wolves and bears, wolverines and lynx are to be found in Bear Wood. They are in separate enclosures so will not come face to face with the larger animals, though they will smell and hear them. The wolverine is a member of the mustelid family that includes badgers, weasels and otters. It too once roamed British woodland before disappearing, presumably hunted for its fur and meat. A handful of wolverine bones have been found in Britain, more than half of them in south-west England and south Wales. Lynx vanished after the wolverine as woodland was chopped down, and next it was the turn of the bear to disappear. Quite when native British bears became extinct is not known. Bears were a familiar sight in Roman and medieval times but they may have been imported. Of the four Bear Wood creatures, only the wolf was left by 1086 and a mere 15% of Britain was covered by woods. Wolves were hunted to extinction by the 16th or 17th century and now only 2% of Britain is covered in ancient woodland. Introducing the bears and wolves to each other will be a delicate process. \u201cYou have to observe rules,\u201d said Schwitzer. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw them in together.\u201d At first the five wolves will be brought into a separate enclosure next to the large one where the four bears are currently roaming so the two species can get used to one another. When the keepers judge the time is right the wolves will be allowed into the joint enclosure, though they will be able to retreat without the bears following them if they feel the need. \u201cConflict arises around prey or offspring,\u201d said Schwitzer. So they will feed separately. The three male bears are to be castrated and the five wolves are all males so there will be no breeding and so no young to fight over. The fact that the bears and wolves have a 10,000 sq metre wooded paddock to share should help. They can keep away from each other if they want and interact if the mood takes them. Scientists will also be interested to find out what impact they have on the woodland. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to see how they change the flora and fauna,\u201d said Schwitzer. The squirrels are likely to flee and the bears may clear vegetation, allowing more light-loving plants into the woods. Different invertebrates may move in. It will also be interesting to see how the bears and wolves operate as summer gives way to autumn and winter. It is not clear whether the bears will dig themselves into a den and hibernate. Across the Severn wild boar live wild in the Forest of Dean after accidental and deliberate releases from farms, and a year ago beavers were released into a large pen in the forest as part of a project to alleviate flooding. Wild beavers have also returned to a river in Devon. They are unlikely to be joined any time soon by bears or wolves.",

He was born in Bacup, Lancashire, to an English father, Dennis Clegg, and a Rhodesian mother, Muriel, a jazz singer from a Lithuanian Jewish family. They divorced while Johnny was still an infant and his mother moved to Rhodesia, Israel and Zambia before settling in South Africa.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Iran disputes Trump\u2019s claim it lost a drone Tehran has denied Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the USS Boxer shot down an Iranian drone in the strait of Hormuz, after the unmanned aircraft flew within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored calls to stand down. The supposed incident occurred amid continuing tensions in the region, but also on the same day that Iran offered to permanently accept enhanced inspections of its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of US sanctions. Friendly fire. Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister tweeted that the country had not lost any drones in the strait of Hormuz, and speculated that the USS Boxer might have \u201cshot down their own [drone] by mistake!\u201d President tries to distance himself from racist chant at rally Trump has attempted to distance himself from the crowd\u2019s racist chants urging him to \u201csend back\u201d congresswoman Ilhan Omar at his campaign rally in North Carolina this week. Democrats condemned the spectacle as \u201cdespicable\u201d and \u201cvile\u201d while Republicans stayed mostly quiet on the matter. Trump said on Thursday he \u201cwas not happy\u201d with the chant and claimed falsely that he had shut it down. But, as Sabrina Siddiqui reports, the president has targeted Omar as part of his divisive 2020 strategy. Fox News. Far from condemning Trump, prominent figures on Fox News praised the ugly scenes. David Smith assesses the symbiotic relationship between the president and his favourite network. Mocking America. Trump has attacked Omar and her colleagues for hating America, yet he has denigrated and criticised the US more than any presidential candidate in memory, writes Luke O\u2019Neil. FBI: Trump directly involved in Stormy Daniels payment talks Trump was directly involved in discussions leading to an illegal hush-money payment to the porn actor Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election, according to the FBI. Trump and his then press secretary, Hope Hicks, spoke repeatedly to his longterm legal fixer Michael Cohen as Daniels \u2013 AKA Stephanie Clifford \u2013 threatened to go public about her affair with the future president. Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence, in part for campaign finance crimes. Going public. The FBI assessment emerged in an unsealed court filing. One agent wrote of their belief that \u201cat least some of these communications [between Trump, Hicks and Cohen] concerned the need to prevent Clifford from going public\u201d. Trump\u2019s businesses. Allegations of corruption still dog the president in office as he refuses to give up his businesses, leaving them open to clientele with significant conflicts of interest, as Pete Stone reports. At least 33 dead after arson attack on Japanese anime studio At least 33 people have died in a fire started by an arsonist at the Kyoto Animation studio, in Japan\u2019s worst incident of mass murder for almost two decades. The suspect was injured in the fire and taken to hospital with dozens of other victims before being arrested. Identified only as a 41-year-old man, he is thought to have poured petrol in various areas of the three-storey building before setting it alight, with more than 70 people inside. Witnesses said they heard him shouting accusations of plagiarism. Public donations. A crowdfunding effort has already raised more than $1m in pledges for the animation company and other victims of the fire. \u2018Too painful.\u2019 The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the attack had left him speechless. He was joined in expressing his condolences by other world leaders, as well as the Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, and anime fans around the world. Crib sheet The Bangladeshi government is preparing to move some of its 1 million Rohingya refugees, who are sheltering from violent persecution in Myanmar, to a remote silt island prone to severe flooding and cyclones. The Chicago Police Board has fired four police officers for allegedly covering up a white officer\u2019s fatal shooting of the black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in 2014. The Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has described the jail conditions of the drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n as \u201cinhumane\u201d, after Guzm\u00e1n was sentenced to life plus 30 years in prison by a US court this week.

      "body": "<p>Ilya Kaminsky has only published two poetry collections in 15 years, but his second, <em>Deaf Republic</em>, has been hailed as \u201ca contemporary epic\u201d, \u201ca perfectly extraordinary book\u201d from a poet described by the writer Garth Greenwell as \u201cthe most brilliant of his generation, one of the world\u2019s few geniuses\u201d. The man who has attracted all this hyperbole has a wraparound smile, and responds to a photographer\u2019s demand to look more animated by reciting poetry in Russian and English. \u201cHere is some Mandelstam,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I am going to give you some Emily Dickinson.\u201d His speech drags slightly and he is apologetic about his accent: \u201cAfter all this time, it should really be better,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I only hear what the hearing aids give me.\u201d For Kaminsky is hard of hearing \u2013 so, if you count sign language alongside Russian and Ukrainian, he is speaking in his fourth language.</p> <p><em>Deaf Republic </em>is an investigation into \u201cwhat happens to language in a time of crisis, how we carry on and how we try to remain human,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to find out in my book and in my life.\u201d In just under 60 lyric poems, some only two lines long, it tells the story of a fictional town whose inhabitants react to the murder of a deaf child by shutting their ears. Little Petya\u2019s crime is to spit at an army sergeant who has arrived to break up a public gathering in a time of martial law. \u201cDeafness passes through us like a police whistle,\u201d say the townspeople of Vasenka, who are described by the author as \u201cthe \u2018we\u2019 who tell the story\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/10/the-best-recent-poetry-review--roundup\">The best recent poetry \u2013 review roundup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kaminsky himself lost most of his hearing after contracting mumps aged four in the Ukrainian city of Odessa. \u201cThe Soviet doctor said it was just a cold and sent us away,\u201d he says, without self-pity. This life-changing medical misjudgment would connect him with history in ways that he is still processing. \u201cIt is on the day Brezhnev dies that my mother learns of my deafness, and the odyssey of doctors and hospitals begins,\u201d he wrote recently. \u201cMy mother shouts at senior citizens in public transport to promptly get up please and give her sick child a seat; my father, embarrassed, hides on the other side of the trolley.

But the delay was also due to the formal challenge he had set himself: \u201cI am a lyric poet but I wanted to tell a story so I had to find a way to do it.

      "bodyText": "Ilya Kaminsky has only published two poetry collections in 15 years, but his second, Deaf Republic, has been hailed as \u201ca contemporary epic\u201d, \u201ca perfectly extraordinary book\u201d from a poet described by the writer Garth Greenwell as \u201cthe most brilliant of his generation, one of the world\u2019s few geniuses\u201d. The man who has attracted all this hyperbole has a wraparound smile, and responds to a photographer\u2019s demand to look more animated by reciting poetry in Russian and English. \u201cHere is some Mandelstam,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I am going to give you some Emily Dickinson.\u201d His speech drags slightly and he is apologetic about his accent: \u201cAfter all this time, it should really be better,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I only hear what the hearing aids give me.\u201d For Kaminsky is hard of hearing \u2013 so, if you count sign language alongside Russian and Ukrainian, he is speaking in his fourth language. Deaf Republic is an investigation into \u201cwhat happens to language in a time of crisis, how we carry on and how we try to remain human,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to find out in my book and in my life.\u201d In just under 60 lyric poems, some only two lines long, it tells the story of a fictional town whose inhabitants react to the murder of a deaf child by shutting their ears. Little Petya\u2019s crime is to spit at an army sergeant who has arrived to break up a public gathering in a time of martial law. \u201cDeafness passes through us like a police whistle,\u201d say the townspeople of Vasenka, who are described by the author as \u201cthe \u2018we\u2019 who tell the story\u201d. Kaminsky himself lost most of his hearing after contracting mumps aged four in the Ukrainian city of Odessa. \u201cThe Soviet doctor said it was just a cold and sent us away,\u201d he says, without self-pity. This life-changing medical misjudgment would connect him with history in ways that he is still processing. \u201cIt is on the day Brezhnev dies that my mother learns of my deafness, and the odyssey of doctors and hospitals begins,\u201d he wrote recently. \u201cMy mother shouts at senior citizens in public transport to promptly get up please and give her sick child a seat; my father, embarrassed, hides on the other side of the trolley. I cannot hear a word \u2026 Brezhnev is dead. Strangers wear black clothes in public. Thus begins the history of my deafness.\u201d It was only after he arrived in the US at the age of 16 that he was fitted with hearing aids. \u201cWhen I came to the west I saw that there was this otherness that I didn\u2019t perceive before,\u201d he says. \u201cPretty much all my childhood and adolescence was spent watching the Soviet Union fall apart, but I couldn\u2019t hear, so I followed the century with my eyes. I didn\u2019t know anything different, but now I understand that I was seeing in a language of images.\u201d Born into a Jewish family in Odessa in 1977, he would observe cultural variations through gesture: \u201cYou really notice as a deaf child how faces move differently when a different language is spoken.\u201d The Yiddish-inflected animation with which his parents talked contrasted with the Soviet-imposed Russian of his school teachers, so that the writing of Isaac Babel came as a revelation: \u201cHe wrote in a very stylised Russian with Yiddish grammar and it was shocking to me to see that the way my parents spoke in private was in a book.\u201d He isn\u2019t totally deaf, he points out, and \u201cmaybe because of how my parents handled it, I never felt it was a disability.

Crying? Confessing? How will Big Little Lies end?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Similar treatment has been meted out to the second season of Big Little Lies. The show\u2019s first season was a resounding success \u2013 an at times impressionistic exploration of female unhappiness, domestic abuse and friendship set against the crashing waves of Monterey Beach, and the show\u2019s distinctive, swelling soundtrack. <br><br>Season one delivered Nicole Kidman as the beautiful, fragile Celeste, a Blanche DuBois-like character trapped in a sleek, modernist doll\u2019s house with Perry, her abusive brute of a husband (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd). It gave us Reese Witherspoon at her type-A finest, playing Madeline, a woman too uptight to realise that the life she had worked so hard to create has made her unhappy, and is causing her to self-sabotage. The show, an adaptation of Liane Moriaty\u2019s 2014 novel, was nominated for 16 Emmys and won eight, including acting awards for Kidman, Skarsg\u00e5rd and Laura Dern (who plays CEO Renata Klein.)</p> \n<p>The second season concludes next week with a much-anticipated courtroom showdown between Celeste and her nefarious, meddling mother-in-law Mary Louise (Meryl Streep), as they battle for custody of Celeste\u2019s children. It looks likely that this will be the final season of the show: HBO boss Casey Bloys <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/big-little-lies-season-3-unrealistic/\">has said it\u2019s \u201cnot realistic\u201d</a> they will be able to find time in Witherspoon, Streep and Kidman\u2019s A-list schedules to film a third season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfa334818bda97d266c056ba58e2603126b2560d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfa334818bda97d266c056ba58e2603126b2560d/21_0_1403_842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meryl Streep\u2019s memeable scream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meryl Streep\u2019s memeable scream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Season two has copped a fair amount of criticism online \u2013 some justified, some less so. The show has sometimes felt reverse-engineered around social media-friendly, memeable moments: Streep\u2019s yelp in the season two premiere; Dern\u2019s prison visiting-room explosion as she realises her wastrel husband Gordon has squandered the family wealth. (\u201cI will <em>not</em> not be rich!\u201d Dern bellows, jabbing her finger on the plexiglass.)</p> \n<p>At times, this season has felt inconsistent.

And the show\u2019s overuse of flashbacks is tiresome \u2013 if I have to see any of the Monterey Five in their Audrey Hepburn costumes from the season one finale again, I\u2019ll scream louder than Mary Louise.</p> \n<p>It is probable that this second season has felt patchy due to internal factors: earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-andrea-arnold-lost-creative-control-jean-marc-vallee-1202156884/\">an IndieWire exclusive</a> claimed that, during post-production, show-runner David E Kelley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/does-andrea-arnolds-experience-on-big-little-lies-suggest-that-auteurs-are-doomed\">wrested back creative control</a> from American Honey film-maker Andrea Arnold, the second season\u2019s director, and handed the reins to season one executive producer and director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e. If accurate, it is a depressing read: despite being told she would be given a free hand to direct and edit season two according to her own vision, Arnold had control taken away from her in the cutting room, and a team of editors spliced up her work, and filmed reshoots, to mimic Vall\u00e9e\u2019s style. (It appears likely there is some truth to the claims: watching the season two credits, I spied an absurd 11 editors listed on the episode Kill Me, whereas an episode from the same point in season one had fewer than half that number.)</p> \n<p>Fragments of Arnold\u2019s influence still linger, perfume-like, in season two. A film-maker admired for her ability to find moments of beauty in mundane settings, as well as the deft intimacy of her camerawork and her use of natural light, Arnold\u2019s handiwork is written all over the moment in episode seven where Celeste walks through a glint of sunlight in the Monterey courthouse. A queasy closeup shot of a plate of quivering oysters earlier in the season also reminded me of the scene in American Honey<em> </em>where one of the children Star is babysitting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvbMlgF2auw\">stabs a raw chicken.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a760af56c796c9e38a77fadf34857a5d789ad6c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a760af56c796c9e38a77fadf34857a5d789ad6c/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Underwritten ...

(Kravitz turned in a fine performance, despite the script giving her scant material to work with.)

We can\u2019t help it; we worry away at imperfect character arcs or narrative misfires until the very fabric of the show comes apart in our hands. The more the first season of a show delivers, the more the armchair commentariat chews through any subsequent offerings, like moths working through cashmere.

In an outspoken intervention days before Johnson is expected to win the keys to Downing Street, the chancellor said it was \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d for the UK to extend its EU membership beyond 31 October. Asked whether he would rule out voting in favour of a no-confidence motion against Johnson, Hammond told Le Monde and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung: \u201cI will take steps to avoid an exit without agreement apart from an explicit parliamentary approval. \u201cThere should be a new and sincere attempt to reach a consensus. If we do not find a solution with the members, we may have to ask the British to give their opinion again, in one form or another.\u201d Asked again to rule out supporting a motion of no confidence, Hammond responded: \u201cI do not exclude anything for the moment.\u201d The chancellor was one of four cabinet ministers who broke ranks with the government to abstain on a vote on Thursday, the result of which prevents Johnson from proroguing, or suspending, parliament in order to push through an exit from the EU without a deal. He also reportedly encouraged others to vote to ensure that parliament continues to sit through September and October. In his interview with the two media outlets, Hammond said he could not see any prospect of a successful negotiation with the EU before 31 October, when Johnson says the UK will leave, \u201cdo or die\u201d.

His own story, which is multicultural, multinational and liberal, speaks for itself.\u201d But Hammond admitted he could understand the frustration in EU capitals at the state of the Brexit process \u201cbecause some of my compatriots are deliberately noisy, rude and inconsiderate\u201d. \u201cSome are trying to make the Europeans so tired that they ask us to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cBut please, do not listen to the the few noise-makers.\u201d Hammond said that the expected exodus of companies from the UK had not yet happened but that he feared for a future in which the EU\u2019s member states would \u201chave the power\u201d to establish heavy controls on UK goods coming to the continent. \u201cI hope there will be intense competition between European ports,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cI believe that the Belgian and Dutch ports are preparing for a fierce competition to take advantage of this commercial traffic.\u201d In the financial sector, the chancellor said there had yet to be an exodus from the City of London. He said: \u201cSome banks have moved a handful of their staff to the EU to deal with the situation. My concern is more about what will happen in a year or two if we do not reach an agreement with the Europeans. In this case, the European authorities will demand that risk control be strengthened and more capital relocated to the continent. \u201cFor the rest, I am surprised that there is no debate in Europe about the risk that a large financial sector represents for taxpayers. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, they had to pay \u00a3180bn to avoid the bankruptcy of the banks in 2008 and 2009. Do the Europeans really want to assume such a burden?\u201d Hammond added that the dropping away of financial activity in the City \u201ccould be a slow process\u201d. \u201cBut it is not certain that this would benefit Paris or Frankfurt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is equally likely that US banks will repatriate their employees to New York and serve the European market from there.\u201d",

Already I\u2019ve sketched a few possible numbers. The evil Bedford Falls oligarch Mr Potter\u2019s Nobody Likes Me I Don\u2019t Care will have audiences hissing from the dress circle, especially if it\u2019s sung, as I hope it will be, by the disgraced Radio 5 presenter and Millwall fan Danny Baker. I\u2019ve given the love duet Buffalo Gals a grime makeover, which must be sung by Neneh Cherry and Stormzy. (That\u2019s right, Neneh takes Donna Reed\u2019s role and Stormzy James Stewart\u2019s. Deal with it.) When Stormzy finds something in his pocket and raises it to the spotlight to sing the showstopper Zuzu\u2019s Petals (\u201cOh, my darling daughter/ What can I say? I\u2019ve been a total plonker\u201d), you won\u2019t know whether to laugh, cry or ask for your money back (good luck with the last of these). McCartney rightly says that Capra\u2019s film tells \u201ca universal story we can all relate to\u201d and that he was drawn to it as a result. While that explains why he didn\u2019t adapt David Foster Wallace\u2019s Infinite Jest, it is not a good enough reason: if it were, he could just as easily have written Pingu: The Musical or an all singing, all dancing version of Murder on the Orient Express in which Donald Trump is stabbed by every passenger. Both of which I\u2019d rather see. While I applaud him for writing his first musical aged 77, and thereby showing a forbearance that the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend would have done well to share (oh, come on: who listens to Tommy or Quadrophenia in 2019?), I wish he\u2019d written something nearer to home. I would have loved a musical about the Beatles\u2019 breakup, provisionally entitled How Do You Sleep?, or an adaptation of Terence Davies\u2019 heartbreaker Distant Voices, Still Lives, set in the 50s Liverpool that McCartney knew before he became famous. Again, I\u2019m quite prepared to sketch out a few numbers for either, Sir Paul, if you\u2019d fancy. \u2022 Stuart Jeffries is a feature writer",

I had launched a non-profit organisation called <a href=\"https://www.puppyprodigies.org/\" title=\"\">Puppy Prodigies</a>, to train service dogs for people with disabilities, and I supported her mother while she had her litter. Ricochet was the ninth of 10.</p> <p>She was a brilliant puppy \u2013 high energy and lots of fun; she got her name because she was literally bouncing off the walls. She began service dog training at a few days old and started off well, but at 16 weeks she began to shut down; she was more interested in chasing birds. Luckily she found something else to do.</p> <p>We live in San Diego, California, half an hour from the ocean. I never planned to raise a surf dog, but she had been in a kids\u2019 pool at eight weeks old and showed great balance on a boogie board. We progressed to a bigger pool, then the bay, then the ocean.</p> <p>I got her a 6ft foam board and a pink lifejacket. I don\u2019t surf so, as she improved, she got a water handler. Surf dog contests were becoming popular in southern California and someone suggested she take part in one, at Ocean Beach in San Diego. Ricochet was placed third of about 15 dogs. I felt so proud \u2013 not because she had a medal but because she had shown what she was capable of.</p> <p>Typically in contests, the dogs have 10 minutes to catch as many waves as they can.

There\u2019s always a crowd of spectators on the beach. </p> <p>On the board, she looks pretty serious and focused. Dogs wag their tails on the sand, but not so much on the water, where they need them for balance. She\u2019s 11 years old now and has taken part in about 20 contests. She has nine gold medals and has been placed second or third in most of the others.</p> <p>Soon after she started surfing, Ricochet started doing something more meaningful with her talent. She began to accompany children with disabilities for surf therapy, and we have used her profile to fundraise for them, working first with Patrick, a 14-year-old quadriplegic boy.

Like many sufferers, I will occasionally convince myself that I\u2019m fine and will stop taking my pills. That allows me to experience the pleasure of sex again; to have emotions and feel human. But I always crash eventually and have to begrudgingly go back on my medication. It could be worse. Perhaps I should get a T-shirt printed that reads: \u201cI\u2019d rather be happy than horny.\u201d The thing is, when I\u2019m feeling especially lonely, I don\u2019t always know if that\u2019s true. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.

      "body": "<p>In the summer of 1979, Vince Lawrence had got himself a part-time job as an usher at Comiskey Park baseball stadium, home to the Chicago White Sox. It wasn\u2019t an ideal job for a black teenager. Comiskey Park was next door to Bridgeport, a neighbourhood of the city where, as Lawrence puts it, \u201cit was common knowledge that you might not want to be hanging around after dark, because there were people there who for sure don\u2019t like you based on your colour\u201d. The area was so notorious for racism that even one of the White Sox\u2019s star players, Thad Bosley, had found his car surrounded by a mob after taking a wrong turning driving home after a game, the situation only defused when one of them recognised him.</p> <p>Still, Lawrence\u2019s job had perks. Punters rich enough to sit in the stadium\u2019s boxes would tip well, you could get a good view of the game and there were regular special promotional events, often with music: country nights, Elvis nights. Tonight, he was looking forward to seeing a band called Teenage Radiation, fronted by loudmouth local radio DJ Steve Dahl: they had recorded a parody single called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LAApU-QHfI\" title=\"\">Do Ya Think I\u2019m Disco</a>, part of Dahl\u2019s ongoing campaign against the commercially dominant genre in late 70s America. Embittered by the fact that he had been fired by a station called WDAI when it switched formats from AOR to disco, Dahl had been endlessly mouthing off on air at his new station, WLUP, also known as The Loop: snapping disco records or dragging the needle across them, encouraging people to join his anti-disco organisation, the Insane Coho Lips. He had worked out a promotion with the White Sox: turn up at Comiskey Park on 12 July with a disco record and you would get in for 98\u00a2. Dahl planned to fill a dumpster with the records and blow them up as a publicity stunt.</p> <p>Lawrence realised something wasn\u2019t right: people weren\u2019t just turning up with disco records, but anything made by a black artist. \u201cI said to my boss: \u2018Hey, a lot of these records they\u2019re bringing in aren\u2019t disco \u2013 they\u2019re R&amp;B, they\u2019re funk. Should I make them go home and get a real disco record?\u2019 He said no: if they brought a record, take it, they get a ticket.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI want to say maybe the person bringing the record just made a mistake. But given the amount of mistakes I witnessed, why weren\u2019t there any Air Supply or Cheap Trick records in the bins? No Carpenters records \u2013 they weren\u2019t rock\u2019n\u2019roll, right? It was just disco records and black records in the dumpster.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec666d2c59d6293f0094fb61593b2b252c55bc4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec666d2c59d6293f0094fb61593b2b252c55bc4c/0_0_2771_2787/994.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Dahl says he is \u2018worn out from defending myself as a racist homophobe\u2019.\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Dahl says he is \u2018worn out from defending myself as a racist homophobe\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things turned uglier after Dahl\u2019s demolition took place and the crowd \u2013 estimated at 50,000 \u2013 rushed the field. Unable to cope with the surge of people the ushers were told to go home and that the police would have to deal with what was degenerating into a riot. \u201cSomeone walked up to me said: \u2018Hey you \u2013 disco sucks!\u2019 and snapped a 12in in half in my face,\u201d Lawrence says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started feeling like: \u2018OK, they\u2019re just targeting me because I\u2019m black.\u2019 I\u2019ve got a Loop T-shirt on \u2013 what\u2019s the difference between me and the next usher trying to get back to his locker? I was one of the few African American people in the stadium. Steve Dahl said it wasn\u2019t discriminatory, he was an equal opportunities offender or whatever, but Steve didn\u2019t invite no brothers to Comiskey Park.\u201d</p> <p>Forty years on, Disco Demolition Night remains one of the most controversial events in pop history.

Of the 16 singles that made the top of the US chart in the first half of 1979, only three were not disco tracks. The previous year, disco singles had been No 1 for 37 weeks out of 52. \u201cIn any big city in America, you could turn the radio dial and catch disco on as many as five or more stations,\u201d says Alice Echols, cultural historian, academic and author of <a href=\"http://www.timlawrence.info/articles2/2013/7/16/review-of-hot-stuff-disco-and-the-remaking-of-american-culture-by-alice-echols-journal-of-popular-music-studies-23-2-june-2011\" title=\"\">Hot Stuff: Disco and the Remaking of American Culture</a>. \u201cIt had pushed AOR not to the margins precisely, but classic rock didn\u2019t have the dominance on radio that it once had. Live music venues were increasingly switching over to disco.\u201d</p> <p>This didn\u2019t please everyone. \u201cEven though record labels were making a lot of money off disco, they were holding their nose,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were worried about it crashing, but they wanted it to crash so they could go back to classic rock. There was also a grassroots anti-disco movement, a national effort on the part of people involved with AOR. There were people who thought it threatened their livelihoods, because of its gobbling up of live venues; there were people who just thought it sounded plastic and synthetic and commercial; there were people who were just nakedly racist and homophobic.\u201d</p> <p>Nichols says that disco\u2019s dominance was, for some of the haters, inseparable from issues such as busing and affirmative action, initiatives designed to reduce racial segregation in US schools and colleges. Fear of disco, she says, was partly \u201cthe fear that American identity was no longer synonymous with whiteness. DJs in Detroit formed a disco vigilante group called the Disco Dux Klan. Originally, their efforts were going to involve wearing white sheets and robes \u2013 they got rid of that part of it. And then there were people like Steve Dahl, for whom disco represented a sort of emasculation: you couldn\u2019t wear a scruffy T-shirt and jeans, you had to get dressed up and, worst of all, your girlfriend or wife expected you to humiliate yourself by fucking dancing. Some of the push back against disco also had to do with feminism.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03d6900fe5d9dc9a96aad5ef63d78f6dd1b2fc33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03d6900fe5d9dc9a96aad5ef63d78f6dd1b2fc33/0_57_1848_1109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever the reasons behind it, Disco Demolition Night had a startling and immediate impact.

      "bodyText": "In the summer of 1979, Vince Lawrence had got himself a part-time job as an usher at Comiskey Park baseball stadium, home to the Chicago White Sox. It wasn\u2019t an ideal job for a black teenager. Comiskey Park was next door to Bridgeport, a neighbourhood of the city where, as Lawrence puts it, \u201cit was common knowledge that you might not want to be hanging around after dark, because there were people there who for sure don\u2019t like you based on your colour\u201d. The area was so notorious for racism that even one of the White Sox\u2019s star players, Thad Bosley, had found his car surrounded by a mob after taking a wrong turning driving home after a game, the situation only defused when one of them recognised him. Still, Lawrence\u2019s job had perks. Punters rich enough to sit in the stadium\u2019s boxes would tip well, you could get a good view of the game and there were regular special promotional events, often with music: country nights, Elvis nights. Tonight, he was looking forward to seeing a band called Teenage Radiation, fronted by loudmouth local radio DJ Steve Dahl: they had recorded a parody single called Do Ya Think I\u2019m Disco, part of Dahl\u2019s ongoing campaign against the commercially dominant genre in late 70s America. Embittered by the fact that he had been fired by a station called WDAI when it switched formats from AOR to disco, Dahl had been endlessly mouthing off on air at his new station, WLUP, also known as The Loop: snapping disco records or dragging the needle across them, encouraging people to join his anti-disco organisation, the Insane Coho Lips. He had worked out a promotion with the White Sox: turn up at Comiskey Park on 12 July with a disco record and you would get in for 98\u00a2. Dahl planned to fill a dumpster with the records and blow them up as a publicity stunt. Lawrence realised something wasn\u2019t right: people weren\u2019t just turning up with disco records, but anything made by a black artist. \u201cI said to my boss: \u2018Hey, a lot of these records they\u2019re bringing in aren\u2019t disco \u2013 they\u2019re R&amp;B, they\u2019re funk. Should I make them go home and get a real disco record?\u2019 He said no: if they brought a record, take it, they get a ticket.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI want to say maybe the person bringing the record just made a mistake. But given the amount of mistakes I witnessed, why weren\u2019t there any Air Supply or Cheap Trick records in the bins? No Carpenters records \u2013 they weren\u2019t rock\u2019n\u2019roll, right? It was just disco records and black records in the dumpster.\u201d Things turned uglier after Dahl\u2019s demolition took place and the crowd \u2013 estimated at 50,000 \u2013 rushed the field. Unable to cope with the surge of people the ushers were told to go home and that the police would have to deal with what was degenerating into a riot. \u201cSomeone walked up to me said: \u2018Hey you \u2013 disco sucks!\u2019 and snapped a 12in in half in my face,\u201d Lawrence says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started feeling like: \u2018OK, they\u2019re just targeting me because I\u2019m black.\u2019 I\u2019ve got a Loop T-shirt on \u2013 what\u2019s the difference between me and the next usher trying to get back to his locker? I was one of the few African American people in the stadium. Steve Dahl said it wasn\u2019t discriminatory, he was an equal opportunities offender or whatever, but Steve didn\u2019t invite no brothers to Comiskey Park.\u201d Forty years on, Disco Demolition Night remains one of the most controversial events in pop history. Last month, when the White Sox commemorated its anniversary, it attracted widespread criticism from Billboard to Vice and the Economist, of a kind that was absent in 1979. Then, only Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone suggested that there was something distinctly ugly about the vast crowd of white men publicly destroying music predominantly made by black artists, dominated by female stars and with a core audience that was, at least initially, largely gay. \u201cWhite males, 18 to 34, are the most likely to see disco as the product of homosexuals, blacks and Latins, and \u2026 to respond to appeals to wipe out such threats to their security.\u201d Dahl remains defiant. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview for this feature, but made his position clear in the 2016 book Disco Demolition: The Night Disco Died. \u201cI\u2019m worn out from defending myself as a racist homophobe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe event was not anti-racist, not anti-gay \u2026 we were just kids pissing on a musical genre.\u201d Moreover, he was defending \u201cthe Chicago rock\u2019n\u2019roll lifestyle\u201d from an unwanted musical invasion. The rise of disco to mainstream success on the back of Saturday Night Fever\u2019s unexpected success was \u201ca repudiation of all things rough \u2013 like rock\u2019n\u2019roll and bar nights\u201d and \u201cdemean[ed] the ordinary life that kids inhabited\u201d. To understand Disco Demolition Night, you have to understand how commercially dominant disco had become in the US at the time.

Also, in the Australian desert where 15,000 hectares of solar panels could be a game-changer in Asian energy supplies. Thanks for reading. This newsletter will remain free of charge forever. But if you value the Upside, do consider supporting the Guardian with a small contribution. If you have Upside stories or suggestions, please tell us about them at theupside@theguardian.com.",

Nicknamed <em>El Profe</em>, the teacher, he is part man, part myth, mixing fear, fascination and fondness too, his very name striking terror into footballers\u2019 hearts. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s fitness coach, a 61-year-old Uruguayan drill sergeant who spent the morning of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">2016 Champions League final</a> doing laps of San Siro, Ortega likes nothing more than running them until they drop, vomit and pass out \u2013 while shouting at them.

For the first time in 40 years, they weren\u2019t there last summer, but now they\u2019re back and it\u2019s bigger, and harder, than ever before. Two gyms have been set up in marquees and alongside the pitch where Trippier is taking his first steps as an Atl\u00e9tico player is the Profe Slope, a 50 metre, 30% climb Ortega had built and up which he sends his players. July\u2019s blisters are May\u2019s strength, they like to say.</p> \n<p>Trippier\u2019s timing was good: that morning, the last session before he arrived, Diego Costa had to drop out after one sprint up the Profe Slope left him dizzy and disoriented, and he has not had to follow yet. But, beware, it\u2019s there, it will be used and they were quickly on to him. Thursday morning was tough, still felt on Thursday evening: the grin, and the sweat, spoke of the work. There will be no escape, and if Trippier is to improve anywhere, if there is a place that can make him a better defender, it is here.

He was talking Trippier through the movements as he was thrown straight into a starting XI of sorts, playing in a 4-4-2 alongside Savic, Felipe and Lodi in the first evening and a 4-3-1-2 with newly signed Mario Hermoso in for Felipe in the second.

Close and within earshot: \u201cGo, go, go; calm, calm, beri gud.\u201d At every turn and with every query Burgos was there. He was grateful for it.

      "body": "<p>There was a time in your life before you saw the Cats trailer. That\u2019s hard to believe, I know. It might feel as if your every waking moment since birth has been plagued by monstrous visions of howling piliferous, sexualised Brundleflies, but I assure you this is merely a blip. Soon, some other supposedly prestigious director will release a trailer for another terrible musical where the cast have been digitised to look nightmarish and half-formed, and you will move on.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, I have some questions about the Cats trailer.</p> \n<h2>1. How big are the cats?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5db6997132e7942e3262e8543364f907c074ceec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5db6997132e7942e3262e8543364f907c074ceec/169_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"Cats 1\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>This shouldn\u2019t be difficult. In TS Eliot\u2019s poetry collection Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats, the cats are the size of cats. In the stage musical Cats, the cats are the size of people. But here? It\u2019s hard to know. In one shot, a cat just about fits into a standard dustbin (too big for a cat), another gets its paw stuck in a standard mousetrap (the correct size for a cat). Then there\u2019s this shot, where an entire cat is roughly the size of a standard dining knife (too small for a cat, much too small for a cat). How the hell are audiences supposed to enjoy Cats if they\u2019re constantly trying to discern scale, Tom Hooper?</p> \n<h2>2. Why does Dame Judi Dench, a cat with fur, wear a coat that is made of her own fur?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2621507a2c77ecea3674727bf976f7b37aad6c35\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2621507a2c77ecea3674727bf976f7b37aad6c35/169_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"Cats 2\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Did Dench specifically grow out her fur so that she could cut it off and make it into a coat for her to wear, even though that would be redundant because she was already wearing the fur? Or did she seek out a number of cats with identical fur to hers \u2013 maybe even her own relatives \u2013 and brutally skin them so she could wear them as a garment? Is Dame Judi Dench the Ed Gein of cats? Logically, it has to be one or the other.</p> \n<h2>3. Why do the cats have breasts?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d086e6b61fe76bf38a953eb48377436b6a7ed05b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d086e6b61fe76bf38a953eb48377436b6a7ed05b/335_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"3 Cats\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cRemember Catwoman? She\u2019s sexy, right?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes Tom, she\u2019s sexy\u201d.<br><br>\u201cCould we make our cats as sexy as Catwoman?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that would work, Tom. Catwoman is a woman who simply assumes feline characteristics, whereas the cats in Cats are literally cats.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI get it. It\u2019s OK to want to have sex with Catwoman, because when she takes her clothes off she\u2019s a naked human being. But it isn\u2019t OK to want to have sex with a cat, because cats are already naked, and if they take their fur off then they\u2019re just pulsating masses of blood and sinew?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cYes Tom, that\u2019s exactly it.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNah, screw it, let\u2019s give them tits anyway.\u201d</p> \n<h2>4. When will Rebel Wilson ever catch a break?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38c62ba0b40dedab7b8796e43e108e2e27e8ba2c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38c62ba0b40dedab7b8796e43e108e2e27e8ba2c/0_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"4 Cats\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>By now, Rebel Wilson has played the exact same character in about 300 films. The repetition of having to be the clumsy, too-confident, overweight comic relief again and again, no matter the film, must be exhausting. So she must have been thrilled to get a call to play a role in a tentpole film by the Oscar-winning director of Les Mis\u00e9rables. Except, oh, wait, no, she\u2019s playing the exact same character in this as well. Still, at least this character is covered in a kind of harrowing woodland moss. That\u2019s something, right?</p> \n<h2>5. Wait, did James Corden just vomit into another cat\u2019s face?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f791c73621e2f0e13e55740fe5af2950399f71c6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f791c73621e2f0e13e55740fe5af2950399f71c6/181_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"5 Cats\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Finally, a question with an answer. James Corden did not vomit into another cat\u2019s face. James Corden spat food into another cat\u2019s face. I hope this helps.</p> \n<h2>6. JASON DERULO?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cf56aa8e5fc51808d65c23c9769fb732c0fee8b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cf56aa8e5fc51808d65c23c9769fb732c0fee8b/20_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"6 Cats\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Jason Derulo, performer of hits like Swalla, Wiggle and That\u2019s My Shhh? Jason Derulo, deliverer of the lyric \u201cIs it weird that your bra reminds me of a Katy Perry song\u201d? Jason Derulo, whose biggest screen role until now has been playing Ronald Dawson in one episode of the little-loved television adaptation of Lethal Weapon? Yes. That Jason Derulo.</p> \n<h2>7. Just how badly does Jennifer Hudson want another Oscar?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adbc4cfc65b26c81c70de5f5d9bf63e56d647a58\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adbc4cfc65b26c81c70de5f5d9bf63e56d647a58/169_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"7 Cats\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Hugely. Enormously. With every atom of her being. Hudson\u2019s rendition of Memory in the Cats trailer \u2013 performed in the manner of someone standing on a motorway bridge trying to warn motorists of a cow in the road \u2013 is clearly meant to be this film\u2019s answer to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzNVmZfNoa8\">Anne Hathaway\u2019s I Dreamed a Dream moment</a> in Les Mis\u00e9rables. That performance won Hathaway an Oscar. However, that was because Hathaway was playing an orphaned sex worker who has to sell her own teeth to feed her daughter, set against the backdrop of France\u2019s violent June Rebellion; and not, say, a funny cat in a film about cats.</p> \n<h2>8. What am I doing with my hands?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d59df6faa8f1b757ad37174623d1e9f5437813c3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d59df6faa8f1b757ad37174623d1e9f5437813c3/196_0_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"8 Cats\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>Oh, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m involuntarily peeling the skin off them because apparently that sensation is preferable to looking at any more footage of screaming, digitally augmented, uncanny valley feline hell-mutants.

A veteran of the Nouvelle Vague and an outspoken feminist, and an exceptional feature film-maker who reinvented herself as a documentarian, Varda still has the power to cast a spell.</p> <h2>The Dead Don\u2019t Die (15)</h2> <p><em>(Jim Jarmusch, 2019, US/Swe) 105 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs5ZOcU6Bnw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bs5ZOcU6Bnw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Jim Jarmusch, the great survivor of the 80s wave of US indie, turns again to genre in typically deadpan style. He has done vampires, westerns and hitmen: this time it\u2019s zombies, with cops Bill Murray and Adam Driver investigating gruesome goings-on in small-town USA. Tilda Swinton, Iggy Pop and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny are along for the ride.</p> <h2>The Lion King (PG)</h2> <p><em>(Jon Favreau, 2019, US) 118 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TavVZMewpY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7TavVZMewpY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Disney has been eagerly looting its own back catalogue for some time now, with no sign of it stopping; not only serving to introduce new generations to its major properties, but making some long-overdue diversity tweaks at the same time. Thus, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Alfre Woodward voice the main lion roles, with Beyonc\u00e9 as Nala as well as singing on the soundtrack. Plus the \u201clive\u201d CGI animation is about as real as it\u2019s possible to get.</p> <h2>The Edge (15)</h2> <p><em>(Barney Douglas, 2019, UK) 95 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4jf9_HnBnk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z4jf9_HnBnk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the dust settles on the England cricket team\u2019s World Cup win, here\u2019s a look back at the last time they dominated the global stage: the rapid rise (and fall) of the class of 2009, who went on to win the Ashes in 2011 and appeared world-beaters, until they were hammered 5-0 by Australia in 2014. This doc shows how the chemistry came into being: crucially, the appointment of Andy Flower as head coach and the calm but firm captaincy of Andrew Strauss.</p> <h2>Jaws (12A)</h2> <p><em>(Steven Spielberg, 1975, US)</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1fu_sA7XhE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U1fu_sA7XhE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Long hailed as the first \u201csummer blockbuster\u201d, Spielberg\u2019s career-making monster movie is perhaps not the most calming film to see before you head to the beach.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Varda By Agn\u00e8s (15) (Agn\u00e8s Varda, 2019, France) 115 mins The Belgian-born director enjoyed an amazing increase in affection and popularity in her latter years: this genial lecture-cum-documentary serves as a kind of last testament before her death earlier this year. A veteran of the Nouvelle Vague and an outspoken feminist, and an exceptional feature film-maker who reinvented herself as a documentarian, Varda still has the power to cast a spell. The Dead Don\u2019t Die (15) (Jim Jarmusch, 2019, US/Swe) 105 mins Jim Jarmusch, the great survivor of the 80s wave of US indie, turns again to genre in typically deadpan style. He has done vampires, westerns and hitmen: this time it\u2019s zombies, with cops Bill Murray and Adam Driver investigating gruesome goings-on in small-town USA. Tilda Swinton, Iggy Pop and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny are along for the ride. The Lion King (PG) (Jon Favreau, 2019, US) 118 mins Disney has been eagerly looting its own back catalogue for some time now, with no sign of it stopping; not only serving to introduce new generations to its major properties, but making some long-overdue diversity tweaks at the same time. Thus, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Alfre Woodward voice the main lion roles, with Beyonc\u00e9 as Nala as well as singing on the soundtrack. Plus the \u201clive\u201d CGI animation is about as real as it\u2019s possible to get. The Edge (15) (Barney Douglas, 2019, UK) 95 mins As the dust settles on the England cricket team\u2019s World Cup win, here\u2019s a look back at the last time they dominated the global stage: the rapid rise (and fall) of the class of 2009, who went on to win the Ashes in 2011 and appeared world-beaters, until they were hammered 5-0 by Australia in 2014. This doc shows how the chemistry came into being: crucially, the appointment of Andy Flower as head coach and the calm but firm captaincy of Andrew Strauss. Jaws (12A) (Steven Spielberg, 1975, US) Long hailed as the first \u201csummer blockbuster\u201d, Spielberg\u2019s career-making monster movie is perhaps not the most calming film to see before you head to the beach. Still a drum-tight suspense thriller, with or without the malfunctioning fake shark, it\u2019s one for the ages.

On the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program on Monday, Colvin was questioned about the recent raids on the ABC and on News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst over leaked documents. Colvin was asked whether any government minister was consulted about the raids in advance. He said it was \u201cnormal business\u201d that ministers were not consulted. \u201cThis is police business and we don\u2019t consult with ministers before we do that.\u201d But a spokesperson for the AFP told Guardian Australia each investigation had different circumstances. \u201cThe AFP determines when the minister\u2019s office should be notified of any activity based on the individual circumstances of each investigation,\u201d they said. Last year it was revealed that the office of the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was informed in advance about a raid on the home affairs department during an investigation into the leak of damaging information about the au pairs visa scandal. Text messages obtained by BuzzFeed News under freedom of information laws revealed that AFP deputy commissioner Neil Gaughan tipped off Dutton\u2019s chief of staff, Craig Maclaughlan on 10 October, the day before the raid. \u201cThat warrant activity will now be first thing tomorrow morning,\u201d Gaughan said. \u201cThanks mate \u2013 this arvo also fine,\u201d Maclaughlan replied. Gaughan responded with a thumbs-up emoji. Dutton has continually denied being informed of the raid, even if his office knew in advance. Gaughan\u2019s text message sparked a formal complaint from the officer whose home and workstation was searched as part of the raids, according to Nine newspapers, stating the text message \u201cprovides me reasonable grounds to suspect the AFP is neither operationally independent or without political bias\u201d. The AFP told the Senate standing committee looking at whether the documents seized were privileged material that the practice of informing the minister\u2019s office was standard policy for matters that were considered politically sensitive. Speaking to Ray Hadley on radio 2GB on Thursday, Dutton insisted politicians had no role in the recent media raids. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter for the AFP and that\u2019s as it should be,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our country we don\u2019t have politicians directing who can be investigated or arrested or raided etc. They\u2019re entirely matters for the police and that is how it will continue and the thought of interfering in a police investigation has never crossed my mind and it won\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s the reality \u2013 not just from a moral stance, but that\u2019s the law in our country.\u201d Guardian Australia has sought comment from Dutton\u2019s office.",

      "body": "<p>The question for me all these years of sending my children into schools has always been where does Indigenous culture belong within the system?</p> <p>Who should teach it and how is it taught?</p> <p>This question reveals itself every year when Naidoc week comes around or that annual \u201cAboriginal parents morning tea\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/11/fire-water-and-astronomy-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-culture-comes-to-life-in-the-classroom\">Fire, water and astronomy: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture comes to life in the classroom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The morning teas are usually an information session as opposed to a discussion about what outcomes we like or expect for our children.</p> <p>(And yes, these are OUR children, not yours so please stop phrasing it that way).</p> <p>I would love it if teachers would start with a welcoming discussion of how would you like for this year to go with your children. Also to ask us if we could recommend anyone in the community for additional resources or any place that could recommend these, then at the end have a discussion about what the teachers had written down to plan. If you do it this way it ensures you\u2019ve really engaged the parents and you respect their opinion. When we come last we feel that you have a plan and you will not waver on this or take on our considerations or recommendations.</p> <p> What I\u2019ve realised is that the children\u2019s daycare and primary schools are singing the same songs, doing the same activities and trying to implement things that have little impact on what expands children\u2019s knowledge of Indigenous peoples. They should be stocking up on resources.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Do as much research as you can before you start asking Aboriginal parents for ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This does not include doing some dot art that you have no idea what the meanings are, or letting girls decorate a Yidaki or singing a \u201ccultural\u201d song you found from the Wiggles. There are people in your area that you can have help sing songs in the language where you\u2019re from, which will enrich your children more.</p> <p>I know starting from scratch can be daunting, so I put together a list of things that educators could start with:</p> <p>1 Every classroom that has a map of Australia should have <a href=\"https://aiatsis.gov.au/aboriginal-studies-press/products/aiatsis-map-indigenous-australia\">this map</a> beside it.</p> <p>This map of different countries is not a definitive map but it is a wonderful visual reminder that Indigenous cultures are diverse, have their own names and languages and boundaries. We are not a monoculture.</p> <p>2 Ring <a href=\"https://www.aecg.nsw.edu.au/about/contact-us/\">NSW AECG</a> as they have teachers that you can hire to teach the correct pronunciations of these words and proper interpretations.</p> <p>In Wiradjuri for example some language teachers have translated \u201cBaby Shark Doo doo doo doo\u201d.</p> <p>3 <a href=\"https://www.sportaus.gov.au/yulunga\">Yulunga</a> (which means \u201cplaying\u201d in Gamori) is a brilliant resource for anyone to have. This is a list of different traditional Indigenous games and sports readily available comprised for people of all ages and abilities.</p> <p>4 If you\u2019re from NSW then go to the <a href=\"http://alc.org.au/\">NSWALC website</a> to find your local lands council and ask for contacts for people in your area to help place a bush tucker garden, teach weaving to girls or making clap sticks. I\u2019ve seen in most schools teachers putting together programs for boys to learn how to make and play the Yidaki while leaving the girls behind. Of course this is not all schools but it has been my experience.</p> <p>5. There is a version of Dark Emu <a href=\"https://www.magabala.com/young-dark-emu.html\">aimed at upper primary students</a>.</p> <p>Dark Emu has educated many of us on Aboriginal agriculture and land management. It thankfully has now been rewritten with young readers in mind, with the hope that the next generation will have a deeper understanding of Indigenous history and culture and the amazing practices and techniques that were developed and sustained over thousands of years across Australia.</p> <p>6 Marcia Langton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.booktopia.com.au/welcome-to-country-schools-edition-marcia-langton/prod9781741176667.html?source=pla&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxoPy1ta_4wIVz4RwCh35VwvREAQYAiABEgK-APD_BwE\">Welcome to Country schools edition</a></p> <p>This book covers prehistory, post-colonial history, language, kinship, knowledge, art, performance, storytelling, native title, the stolen generations, making a rightful place for first Australians and looking to the future for Indigenous Australia. It also has a handy teacher\u2019s guide for how to use it for years 7-10.</p> <p>7 <a href=\"https://indigenousx.com.au/\">IndigenousX</a> has a wide range of articles on any number of topics, all written by Indigenous people. Some are more kid friendly than others but definitely worth searching for relevant articles to use with students.</p> <p>8 <a href=\"https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/media/5086/ccp-tbi-7-10.pdf\">This link</a> provides notes for teachers providing support on how to appropriately imbed Indigenous science in the curriculum from K-10.</p> <p>And remember, Google is your friend! Do as much research as you can before you start asking Aboriginal parents for ideas. Some of us will have answers for you and be happy to help but there\u2019s lots of us who aren\u2019t teachers, don\u2019t have a lot of classroom appropriate resources and don\u2019t have time to do your job for you. When you come to us with no knowledge, no ideas and clearly having done no research it doesn\u2019t fill us with confidence that you\u2019re able to effectively and appropriately discuss topics of culture, history or contemporary issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/as-an-aboriginal-child-i-had-to-listen-in-class-while-taught-captain-cook-discovered-australia\">As an Aboriginal child I had to listen in class while taught Captain Cook 'discovered' Australia | Hayley McQuire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indigenous students should have access to accurate and appropriate information about their own cultures in schools and parents should have confidence that schools are equipped in doing so. I have found myself wishing that schools would just stop teaching anything about culture because when they stuff it up it makes it harder for us to teach our kids that schools are good places that welcome and respect them, and that they should have a basic level of trust that what teachers teach them is true.</p> <p>Schools have made a commitment to Indigenous education through policies and within the curriculum but all too often have not put in the effort to challenge misconceptions, re-educate teachers, discuss issues of racism, or any of the things that are essential to ensure teachers are capable of teaching students about Indigenous peoples and cultures.</p> <p>Please take this list into consideration and forward it to your local school. This list is only a beginning. Hire and pay Indigenous people to do talks, don\u2019t just ask for an Elder \u2013 respect that person\u2019s time and knowledge.

      "bodyText": "The question for me all these years of sending my children into schools has always been where does Indigenous culture belong within the system? Who should teach it and how is it taught? This question reveals itself every year when Naidoc week comes around or that annual \u201cAboriginal parents morning tea\u201d. The morning teas are usually an information session as opposed to a discussion about what outcomes we like or expect for our children. (And yes, these are OUR children, not yours so please stop phrasing it that way). I would love it if teachers would start with a welcoming discussion of how would you like for this year to go with your children. Also to ask us if we could recommend anyone in the community for additional resources or any place that could recommend these, then at the end have a discussion about what the teachers had written down to plan. If you do it this way it ensures you\u2019ve really engaged the parents and you respect their opinion. When we come last we feel that you have a plan and you will not waver on this or take on our considerations or recommendations. What I\u2019ve realised is that the children\u2019s daycare and primary schools are singing the same songs, doing the same activities and trying to implement things that have little impact on what expands children\u2019s knowledge of Indigenous peoples. They should be stocking up on resources. This does not include doing some dot art that you have no idea what the meanings are, or letting girls decorate a Yidaki or singing a \u201ccultural\u201d song you found from the Wiggles. There are people in your area that you can have help sing songs in the language where you\u2019re from, which will enrich your children more. I know starting from scratch can be daunting, so I put together a list of things that educators could start with: 1 Every classroom that has a map of Australia should have this map beside it. This map of different countries is not a definitive map but it is a wonderful visual reminder that Indigenous cultures are diverse, have their own names and languages and boundaries. We are not a monoculture. 2 Ring NSW AECG as they have teachers that you can hire to teach the correct pronunciations of these words and proper interpretations. In Wiradjuri for example some language teachers have translated \u201cBaby Shark Doo doo doo doo\u201d. 3 Yulunga (which means \u201cplaying\u201d in Gamori) is a brilliant resource for anyone to have. This is a list of different traditional Indigenous games and sports readily available comprised for people of all ages and abilities. 4 If you\u2019re from NSW then go to the NSWALC website to find your local lands council and ask for contacts for people in your area to help place a bush tucker garden, teach weaving to girls or making clap sticks. I\u2019ve seen in most schools teachers putting together programs for boys to learn how to make and play the Yidaki while leaving the girls behind. Of course this is not all schools but it has been my experience. 5. There is a version of Dark Emu aimed at upper primary students. Dark Emu has educated many of us on Aboriginal agriculture and land management. It thankfully has now been rewritten with young readers in mind, with the hope that the next generation will have a deeper understanding of Indigenous history and culture and the amazing practices and techniques that were developed and sustained over thousands of years across Australia. 6 Marcia Langton\u2019s Welcome to Country schools edition This book covers prehistory, post-colonial history, language, kinship, knowledge, art, performance, storytelling, native title, the stolen generations, making a rightful place for first Australians and looking to the future for Indigenous Australia. It also has a handy teacher\u2019s guide for how to use it for years 7-10. 7 IndigenousX has a wide range of articles on any number of topics, all written by Indigenous people. Some are more kid friendly than others but definitely worth searching for relevant articles to use with students. 8 This link provides notes for teachers providing support on how to appropriately imbed Indigenous science in the curriculum from K-10. And remember, Google is your friend! Do as much research as you can before you start asking Aboriginal parents for ideas. Some of us will have answers for you and be happy to help but there\u2019s lots of us who aren\u2019t teachers, don\u2019t have a lot of classroom appropriate resources and don\u2019t have time to do your job for you. When you come to us with no knowledge, no ideas and clearly having done no research it doesn\u2019t fill us with confidence that you\u2019re able to effectively and appropriately discuss topics of culture, history or contemporary issues. Indigenous students should have access to accurate and appropriate information about their own cultures in schools and parents should have confidence that schools are equipped in doing so. I have found myself wishing that schools would just stop teaching anything about culture because when they stuff it up it makes it harder for us to teach our kids that schools are good places that welcome and respect them, and that they should have a basic level of trust that what teachers teach them is true. Schools have made a commitment to Indigenous education through policies and within the curriculum but all too often have not put in the effort to challenge misconceptions, re-educate teachers, discuss issues of racism, or any of the things that are essential to ensure teachers are capable of teaching students about Indigenous peoples and cultures. Please take this list into consideration and forward it to your local school. This list is only a beginning. Hire and pay Indigenous people to do talks, don\u2019t just ask for an Elder \u2013 respect that person\u2019s time and knowledge. If anyone refuses to take payment ask that person if they would pick an Indigenous charity such as the Indigenous Literacy Foundation. \u2022 Jade Pearson is from Gumbaynggirr country in Gumma and Scotts Head on her mother\u2019s side, and Peak Hill in Wiradjuri on her dad\u2019s side.

Public sector workers including teachers and police officers are reportedly to be given a \u00a32bn pay rise. MPs have given Boris Johnson a brutal preview of the scale of the challenge facing his premiership, as Conservative rebels voted to block any attempt to suspend parliament in order to force through a no-deal Brexit. The European commission\u2019s new president has said a hard Brexit would have \u201cmassively negative consequences\u201d for both Britain and the EU, and said Brussels could provide emergency help for nations such as Ireland that bear the brunt of such an outcome. Theresa May is throwing down the gauntlet to her successor, pushing for fathers to have more time with their newborns. Writing in the Guardian she says she hopes that better paternity leave and time off work to care for premature infants will be one of her lasting legacies as prime minister.

      "body": "<p>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee was a nice idea at the time. It was a fun, low-stakes YouTube series where you could spend quarter of an hour watching Larry David or Chris Rock shoot the breeze in a cafe. It wasn\u2019t the smartest show. It wasn\u2019t the funniest. Its entertainment value largely depended on how much you liked the subject. But that was the fun of it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jerry-seinfeld\">Jerry Seinfeld</a> didn\u2019t need the money, and you didn\u2019t need to love it. It was just there as a nice little diversion; something to watch at your desk while you ate a sandwich at work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/may/01/jerry-seinfeld-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee-the-five-best-episodes\">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee: the five best episodes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But then Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee jumped ship to Netflix, and something has changed. The charm has been lost, and as a result it\u2019s genuinely difficult to stir any emotion whatsoever about its new season.</p> <p>The difference can be boiled down to three main areas. First, and most overwhelmingly, there\u2019s the money. In 2017, Netflix announced that it had bought Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee \u2013 along with two Jerry Seinfeld standup specials, one of which was formed of archive material \u2013 for $100m. And that\u2019s ridiculous. Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee isn\u2019t a $100m television show. It isn\u2019t The Crown. It\u2019s a collection of videos where two people sit next to each other and chit-chat to a Go-Pro. That\u2019s all. As soon as you start assigning enormous worth to a show like that, it\u2019s bound to alter your perception.</p> <p>If something is slung up on YouTube without fanfare, your expectations are ultimately zero. But when you learn that it cost twice the national GDP of Tuvalu, you can\u2019t help but expect something. And not necessarily something spectacular. You might just expect something like basic production values or a soundtrack that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s ripped directly from the Garageband preset list. And yet the episodes of Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee that aired after the Netflix acquisition have been exactly the same in terms of look and feel as the ones that came before it.</p> <p>There\u2019s a huge difference in platform between Netflix and YouTube.

      "bodyText": "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee was a nice idea at the time. It was a fun, low-stakes YouTube series where you could spend quarter of an hour watching Larry David or Chris Rock shoot the breeze in a cafe. It wasn\u2019t the smartest show. It wasn\u2019t the funniest. Its entertainment value largely depended on how much you liked the subject. But that was the fun of it. Jerry Seinfeld didn\u2019t need the money, and you didn\u2019t need to love it. It was just there as a nice little diversion; something to watch at your desk while you ate a sandwich at work. But then Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee jumped ship to Netflix, and something has changed. The charm has been lost, and as a result it\u2019s genuinely difficult to stir any emotion whatsoever about its new season. The difference can be boiled down to three main areas. First, and most overwhelmingly, there\u2019s the money. In 2017, Netflix announced that it had bought Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee \u2013 along with two Jerry Seinfeld standup specials, one of which was formed of archive material \u2013 for $100m. And that\u2019s ridiculous. Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee isn\u2019t a $100m television show. It isn\u2019t The Crown. It\u2019s a collection of videos where two people sit next to each other and chit-chat to a Go-Pro. That\u2019s all. As soon as you start assigning enormous worth to a show like that, it\u2019s bound to alter your perception. If something is slung up on YouTube without fanfare, your expectations are ultimately zero. But when you learn that it cost twice the national GDP of Tuvalu, you can\u2019t help but expect something. And not necessarily something spectacular. You might just expect something like basic production values or a soundtrack that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s ripped directly from the Garageband preset list. And yet the episodes of Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee that aired after the Netflix acquisition have been exactly the same in terms of look and feel as the ones that came before it. There\u2019s a huge difference in platform between Netflix and YouTube. When something airs on YouTube, it airs for free and its competition is makeup tutorials and cat videos. Compared to YouTube, Netflix is The Ritz. It\u2019s a destination. You pay for Netflix out of your wages, and you expect something of quality in return. You expect cutting-edge drama and amazing comedy. Putting something as tossed-off as Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee on Netflix cheapens the platform and makes the show look worse than ever by comparison. And then there\u2019s the matter of the guests. In its infancy Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee felt like a hobby, like Jerry Seinfeld had thought about which of his friends would make the most interesting subjects. So we saw Larry David talking about old times and fussing over food. We saw Alec Baldwin at his most charming and gregarious. We even saw Ricky Gervais at his least obnoxious. But the show is a product now. It\u2019s a treadmill, 90 episodes long, and quality control is lapsing.

At 18, while working in a strip club to pay the bills (\u201cI\u2019m from the hood,\u201d she shrugs), she had a chance meeting with the rapper Ma$e, who told her: \u201cIf you really want to rap, you need to rap.\u201d Eve took his advice, stopped stripping and focused on music. She was flown to LA to sign with Dr Dre\u2019s Aftermath label, but was dropped after eight months without explanation. \u201cI\u2019d bragged, and had this big going-away party, and then I was back at my mom\u2019s house riding the bus again.

I want people to feel good.\u201d</p> <p>Eve\u2019s life now is strikingly different from her 00s heyday. In 2010, she met British billionaire Maximillion Cooper, as a guest at Gumball 3000, the charity car rally he founded. It is attended by a slew of rich-list petrolheads, and the idea is to drive supercars 3,000 miles, shipping them from country to country via private jet, and partying each night in a new city. \u201cI remember thinking: he must be a player, because you can\u2019t throw something like that and not be a player, right?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57d3f22c72d9b3d2b5dda8160f925b6c20fb0577\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57d3f22c72d9b3d2b5dda8160f925b6c20fb0577/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eve with husband Maximillion Cooper and his children.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eve with husband Maximillion Cooper and his children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cooper proved her wrong. After three years of long-distance dating, Eve moved to London, marrying him and becoming stepmother to his four children. \u201cWe definitely went through some growing pains,\u201d she says. \u201cI moved countries, got married, and became a stepmom all at the same time. That took a lot of figuring out my identity.\u201d Cooper had never dated a black woman before, so Eve spent a lot of time educating him and his children about her experiences as a woman of colour. \u201cWhen we first got together, he thought I was high maintenance because of how often I\u2019d change my hair. I had to say: \u2018No, I\u2019m a black woman, this is not high maintenance, this is part of the culture.\u2019 We had a long conversation the other day about when I go to different countries: if people don\u2019t know who I am, then I get questioned a little longer than him. That\u2019s something he never saw before. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s oblivious, he just lives in a different body to me. It\u2019s been nice to be able to open his eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Did she ever imagine she would be balancing studio sessions with school runs? \u201cWooo, no child!\u201d she laughs. She accepts most things under her personal mantra: \u201cHave a glass of wine, laugh it off.\u201d A few years ago, she was taking her stepdaughter, Jagger, to a school disco. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone, I just wanted to drop her off and get the hell out of there,\u201d she says with a theatrical eye-roll. Unfortunately, her plan backfired. \u201cThis woman, she comes over and says: \u2018Hi, are you Jagger\u2019s stepmom? We\u2019ve heard so much about you!\u2019\u201d Eve raises her eyebrows. \u201cThen she goes: \u2018My husband loves hip-hop. He loves Tupac. Honey, come over! Don\u2019t you just love Tupac?\u2019\u201d She grins. \u201cMy life\u2019s a sitcom, but sometimes you just have to laugh.\u201d</p> <p><em>Eve\u2019s single Reload (feat Konshens) is out now</em></p>",

That took a lot of figuring out my identity.\u201d Cooper had never dated a black woman before, so Eve spent a lot of time educating him and his children about her experiences as a woman of colour. \u201cWhen we first got together, he thought I was high maintenance because of how often I\u2019d change my hair. I had to say: \u2018No, I\u2019m a black woman, this is not high maintenance, this is part of the culture.\u2019 We had a long conversation the other day about when I go to different countries: if people don\u2019t know who I am, then I get questioned a little longer than him. That\u2019s something he never saw before. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s oblivious, he just lives in a different body to me. It\u2019s been nice to be able to open his eyes.\u201d Did she ever imagine she would be balancing studio sessions with school runs? \u201cWooo, no child!\u201d she laughs. She accepts most things under her personal mantra: \u201cHave a glass of wine, laugh it off.\u201d A few years ago, she was taking her stepdaughter, Jagger, to a school disco. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone, I just wanted to drop her off and get the hell out of there,\u201d she says with a theatrical eye-roll. Unfortunately, her plan backfired. \u201cThis woman, she comes over and says: \u2018Hi, are you Jagger\u2019s stepmom? We\u2019ve heard so much about you!\u2019\u201d Eve raises her eyebrows. \u201cThen she goes: \u2018My husband loves hip-hop. He loves Tupac. Honey, come over! Don\u2019t you just love Tupac?\u2019\u201d She grins. \u201cMy life\u2019s a sitcom, but sometimes you just have to laugh.\u201d Eve\u2019s single Reload (feat Konshens) is out now",

Rights advocates had previously hoped Yang would be released and allowed to return to Australia where he has been a citizen since 2002.

If he is being detained for his political views, then he should be released. \u201cWe have worked tirelessly and in good faith with the Chinese government to advocate for Dr Yang\u2019s interests since he was detained. We expect basic standards of justice and procedural fairness to be met. \u201cThe Australian government is concerned by this development in relation to an Australian citizen. We will continue to press Chinese authorities for fair and humane treatment, in accordance with international norms. Our thoughts are with Dr Yang and his family during this difficult period.\u201d Payne said Australian embassy officials had visited Yang on six occasions, most recently on 27 June. \u201cThe Australian government is deeply disappointed that Australian citizen and academic Dr Yang Hengjun has been transferred to criminal detention in China,\u201d the foreign minister said. \u201cThe Australian government has raised its concerns about Yang\u2019s case regularly with China at senior levels.\u201d The elevation in rhetoric from Australia comes amid tensions between the two countries over concerns about potential Chinese interference in national affairs, Huawei and human rights. This week Payne, said Australia was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uighurs, an ethnic minority in Xinjiang. Payne said China had blocked Australia\u2019s attempts to offer consular assistance to dual citizens and their families believed detained in Xinjiang. Labor\u2019s acting shadow foreign minister, Richard Marles, echoed the government\u2019s call for Yang to be released if he was being held for his political views. \u201cWe call on the Chinese government to clarify the reasons for Dr Yang\u2019s detention and to ensure Dr Yang is treated in a fair, unbiased and transparent manner,\u201d he said. Yang, a former Chinese diplomat, is a popular writer and blogger known for his spy novels and political commentary. He is known in online circles as minzhu xiaofan, or \u201cdemocracy peddler\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m like an old auntie jabbering on, always promoting democracy and repeating its benefits,\u201d he wrote in an article in 2014. \u201cDictatorship is always torn down in one night, but good democracy isn\u2019t built in one night.\u201d Human Rights Watch has urged the government to \u201cvigorously press\u201d for Yang\u2019s release.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a Mary Quant exhibition on at the V&amp;A at the moment, which, if you\u2019re able to, I would urge you to visit. If not, and you are more talented with a sewing machine than I am, the website has downloadable sewing patterns. I would find it difficult to muddle through life without pattern; not in the sense of routine, but actual beautiful, artistic patterns. Once, aged 18 and roaming around Moscow, I spotted an older man wearing an almost exact replica of the blue argyle sweater I had on. I bounded over and suggested a photograph together, and it is now one of my favourites: these two strangers beaming. Neither of us speaking the other\u2019s language, but also 100% conversing sartorially. I think of him sometimes and look at that photograph like one with an old friend. I went through a strong Pringle phase (and suffered many golfing jokes). Then there was a tie-dye era, but that was probably because I was living too close to London\u2019s Camden Market at the time. I\u2019m obsessed with damask wallpaper, but too poor to buy Osborne &amp; Little, so I order samples and create collages in the hallway. Also, are you truly an adult until you\u2019ve bought well-cut houndstooth trousers? A girlfriend gave me a beautiful Persian rug which, as The Big Lebowski\u2019s The Dude would have it, really ties the room together. I marvel at it daily. There is a blog dedicated to one man\u2019s quest to document every single one of Wetherspoon\u2019s carpets (there are 950), which are differently and interestingly patterned, and created on old-fashioned looms. I love design classics: the Memphis Geometric pattern dominated the 1980s (see Mr Motivator\u2019s leotards). Think brightly coloured, random squiggles and triangles, dizzy with the fun of it all; the Pride flag, even if Hannah Gadsby did describe it brilliantly as: \u201cA bit busy.

And if I could fit it with my passion for cycling, all the better. So I founded <a href=\"http://www.onemorecity.cc\">One More City</a>, a cycling campaign to fund research into the condition at Imperial College London.

I manage my training regime carefully, and work with a cycling coach. Every sport cyclist has to build up their endurance and strength over time, but when you\u2019re on a treatment regime that causes fatigue and joint pain, you have to be especially mindful of the strain you are putting on your body. Rest time is important, as well as off-bike training for flexibility and core strength.</p> <p>Partly because of the lack of guidance for athletes with cancer, Liz is currently setting up a charity called <a href=\"http://www.cancerfit.me/\">Cancer Fit</a>. Its aim is to encourage every cancer patient to get moving, regardless of how active they were before their diagnosis, but with a particular focus on those who were very fit and want to stay that way.

This year, I\u2019ve had more time to learn to live with my incurable cancer, but the experience will be as meaningful, the challenge as acute and the emotions as raw. Cancer has taken so much from me, but this is my chance to leave it all behind \u2013 an opportunity to prove to myself that, for now, I can still do the things I love.</p> <p>And there\u2019s something special about watching the pros a few days later as they seemingly float up the same climbs that nearly destroyed you.

At two pages, it\u2019s more likely to keep someone\u2019s attention than 10 minutes of names after a two-hour film. While you might not remember who led the finance team for the book you just read any more than you can recall who was the gaffer on the last movie you watched, at least you can close the covers with a sense that more work went into getting the book to them than just the author\u2019s. Perhaps in a few years, books will begin to ape the movies and start including post-credit scenes, just to keep you reading \u2026 \u2022 This article was amended on 19 July 2019, to add acknowledgment of Dialogue Books.",

      "bodyText": "Wildlife lovers are being urged to help record the greatest influx of painted lady butterflies for a decade as part of the world\u2019s largest butterfly survey. Unusually high numbers of the migratory butterfly have flown into Britain from continental Europe in the last six weeks and some of their offspring will emerge during the Big Butterfly Count, which starts on Friday. This \u201cpainted lady summer\u201d is the most significant since 2009, when 11m arrived in Britain. The butterfly is continuously migratory, with offspring making the reverse journey to warmer climes at summer\u2019s end, with successive generations even crossing the Sahara before making their way north again next spring. Chris Packham, vice-president of Butterfly Conservation, urged people to join in the survey in which people can download a free app and spend 15 minutes counting butterflies in their local park, nature reserve or garden. \u201cThe painted lady migration is one of the wonders of the natural world,\u201d said Packham. \u201cTravelling up to 1km in the sky and at speeds of up to 30mph these seemingly fragile creatures migrate hundreds of miles to reach our shores each year. \u201cThis butterfly undertakes an extraordinary 7,500-mile round trip from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle every year \u2013 almost double the length of the famous migrations of the monarch butterfly in North America. \u201cSigns across Europe are looking very promising, meaning that 2019 could be a very good year for the painted lady with high numbers already being recorded across parts of the UK.\u201d According to Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation, this year\u2019s migration began with huge numbers of painted ladies in Cyprus, Rhodes and other parts of the eastern Mediterranean.

There was the fact that in 1962, the year he gave his famous address at Rice University and secured a blank check from Congress to land a man on the moon, Kennedy had already approved 3,205 American \u201cadvisers\u201d to the government of South Vietnam, as well as the use of the dioxin Agent Orange. There was the fact that the brilliant rocket engineers whom that blank check paid were Nazis, Wernher von Braun and Arthur Rudolph, the project that showcased their talents the V-2 rocket that killed 30,000 \u2013 built by forced Jewish laborers from the concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora.</p> <p>No matter how I loved the image of the Apollo 11 launch \u2013 a million exultant people transforming the beaches, binoculars held aloft from yachts where they drank Chardonnay or trucks where they tailgated with Budweiser \u2013 there was the fact that the evening before, the civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy led a group of 500 activists behind mule-drawn carts to meet with Nasa\u2019s deputy administrator, Thomas Paine. One fifth of the country was living without proper healthcare, food and shelter, Abernathy pointed out, an inordinate portion of them black. \u201cI am here,\u201d he said, \u201cto demonstrate with poor people in a symbolic way against the tragic and inexcusable gulf that exists between America\u2019s technological abilities and our social injustices.\u201d The year before, he had held Martin Luther King Jr as he bled to death, and he must have wondered where that image fit in the minds of the audience.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Billions for space, </em>the signs said. <em>Pennies for the hungry.\u201d</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eaecda642adff457f97daa4fac2ff6a1fe343ba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaecda642adff457f97daa4fac2ff6a1fe343ba7/0_0_6065_4072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Poor people\u2019 protest at the Apollo 11 launch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u2018Poor People\u2019s\u2019 protest at the Apollo 11 launch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A note I\u2019d made, about a GI who confronted Neil Armstrong during a GSO tour \u2013 why, he wanted to know, was his country \u201cso interested in the moon instead of the conflict in Vietnam\u201d \u2013 grew different legs, walking across the page to affix itself to something Alan Bean had said: asked about how the Earth looked from the moon, he had two words: \u201cDisappointingly small.\u201d</p> <p><em>No more bread and circuses</em>, went an anti-Apollo protest chant, referencing the Roman poet Juvenal, his polemic against the grain subsidy autocrats afforded the lower classes in an attempt to subdue them. Even if I set aside the issue of money \u2013 $24bn spent on the program, in 1973 currency, or roughly $150bn today \u2013 there was the purer question of American attention, how we guided it.</p> <p>In an era of limited airtime, was the color and sound spent on astronauts and their wives and children something like a crime? Was it agitprop, a western for the cold war audience that made no mention of certain earthly atrocities \u2013 of the black military companies who suffered gangrene for lack of the fresh socks their white peers received, of the systematic environmental devastation of a country smaller than California, of children killed and mutilated by teenagers? To say so would be easy, and you might mention the camp and artificiality shot through all things Apollo \u2013 the telescopic arm designed to hold up a flag in a place without wind, the golf ball Alan Shepard teed off the lunar surface, the basalt craters Nasa named the Sea of Fertility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e3f095575cc501f67ce764a21167c64217a4a79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e3f095575cc501f67ce764a21167c64217a4a79/0_0_5160_3450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Aldrin applauding her husband as she watches TV coverage of splashdown at end of mission.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joan Aldrin applauding her husband as she watches TV coverage of splashdown at end of mission.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vernon Merritt III/The Life Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e4f5d9ac6ac1af5f3f1263b9cc2573b758f1a1fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4f5d9ac6ac1af5f3f1263b9cc2573b758f1a1fa/0_0_4195_2868/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A parade for the Apollo 11 astronauts in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A parade for the Apollo 11 astronauts in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Kennedy\u2019s address that made all that came possible, given 18 months after the early stain on his presidency that was the Bay of Pigs and five weeks shy of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he does a funny thing with progress, asking the audience to consider all achievements of man as happening in the last 50 years: \u201cChristianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year \u2026 Newton explored the meaning of gravity \u2026 Only last week did we discover penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now, if America\u2019s new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Entreating his country in this way, playing that trick with time, he rang a prominent bell in the American psyche: to be a part of a superpower is to be a part of history, and the temptation, in playing a minor part of history, is to see other lives, other parts, as minor \u2013 over and absorbed, after all, in a few relative turns of the planet. It is also, perhaps, to hope less for yourself.</p> <p>Looking back on his position in history, Alan Bean was practical and pragmatic. In training, he said, you replicated all possible smells, the feeling of the spacesuit air conditioner mounted on your back, the half-second delay of communications between Earth and not Earth, so that you could linger in other observations. \u201cThe sun was much brighter than it ever seemed in training on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shadows were much darker.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1a208668fdbe81071f934600a41508561ec36705\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a208668fdbe81071f934600a41508561ec36705/0_0_3000_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Apollo 11 coverage on TV.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Apollo 11 coverage on TV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thinking of the freedom in this \u2013 planning so well, knowing so much, that you needed only notice flexions in light \u2013 and wanting to string a line from one side of my country to the other, I tried to liken those impressions of darkness to the sort of enlightenment I inevitably chased, the other worlds on Earth that I went after.</p> <p>I tried psychedelics first at 15, not long after my father died in his armchair, still surrounded by Carlos Castaneda paperbacks and printouts of Pete Seeger lyrics he\u2019d pinned up in his cluttered rental. I remembered a morning, in an isolated beach town known for removing the signs that announced it, that I left my place by the ocean in search of some water I could drink. I\u2019d eaten acid all night, spoken very little, and I was close to naked as I walked uphill through the sunrise and mist, wearing only someone else\u2019s cut off sweatshirt. The pink of the sky felt like a taste in my mouth, and the sound of the birds like something I could see, their chirp responsible for the movement of leaves.</p> <p>On the side of a one-storey church, which was white and wooden and peaked with a small belfry, I uncurled a green hose and drank a long time. When a woman with a key ring appeared, waving in a kind of admonishment, she seemed like my invention, something that had formed in my careful study of the fog. How did I seem to her, my eyes enormous and empty, the water I\u2019d been desperate for spilled down that dirty, sandy cotton? It must have appeared I\u2019d forgotten everything \u2013 my shoes, my manners, the school day that was about to begin without me \u2013 except the first and most primal needs of my accidental life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6204750cca7aa41bb814e3a9993d5fb2f04fd14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6204750cca7aa41bb814e3a9993d5fb2f04fd14/115_69_3688_2486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of the Rev Ralph Abernathy\u2019s Poor Peoples Campaign demonstrate at supreme court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of the Rev Ralph Abernathy\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign demonstrate at the supreme court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wally McNamee/ Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To identify the ligature between those trips, deep into space or deep into the mind, to find the thread between the bell sleeves and roach clips that were my mother\u2019s country and the 4am steak-and-egg breakfasts that were Alan Bean\u2019s, was not to understand two American cultures \u2013 one who waged war under the guise of protecting democracy, the other who used democracy to denounce that war \u2013 but to clearly see a certain American problem of the self. If the goal of one side was total control of the mind, the goal of the other total freedom, the crucial tools involved were never really the systems or institutions \u2013 the military or government, the school or church \u2013 that supported or repressed those ends. They were always the inner resources of one, for the United States has always been a country that tends to leave you, in so many ways, alone. Alone without a doctor, alone without a union, alone without a guaranteed education, and alone without much of a history, a record so short that what stands out are always the personalities that rose above it \u2013 not the six Apollo landings made possible by Nasa, but Armstrong\u2019s laconic announcement during one of them; not the systematic redlining of cities, which kept black Americans from home ownership, but a few soundbites of Martin Luther King to be played exactly once a year in a country that hasn\u2019t changed enough since he died for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/14/apollo-11-civil-rights-black-america-moon\">'Whitey's on the moon': why Apollo 11 looked so different to black America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the time Bean died, in 2018, the novel was done but the facts remained in my mind unarranged, something like the last things unpacked in a move between very different buildings, fragile, difficult to display in another setting. The sickness of my young country, what it did to people, what it allowed them to do, couldn\u2019t be explained by statistics of armament or dissent, although there was a story I read that stuck with me, a narrative of ameliorative diversion that held the whole Apollo program in its speculative palm. The anecdote is simple: an 18-year-old boy, about to be deployed in 1969, a bag slung over the shoulder of his uniform, calls through the open front door to the driveway where his mother\u2019s car is idling. He wants a few more minutes in front of the television, where Neil Armstrong has just taken his step, and though they\u2019re very late she allows him that, hoping maybe, if he feels the satiety of wonder at what his country has done, he might be able to get some sleep, something he\u2019s been missing given what his country has asked him to do.</p> <p>While it\u2019s certain the war crimes of My Lai or Khe Sanh would have occurred with or without a grand and expensive show going on in the sky above them, it might be true that it did something for how Americans treated each other, then. Answering Ralph Abernathy, Thomas Paine said: \u201cIf we could solve the problems of poverty by not pushing the button to launch men to the moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button.\u201d He asked that the leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center \u201cregard the space program \u2026 as an encouraging demonstration of what the American people could accomplish when they had vision, leadership and adequate resources,\u201d and to pray for the safety of the astronauts.</p> <p>Finally, he offered Abernathy and the activists VIP seating to watch the Saturn lift off, and the two peaceably shook hands. Thinking of Abernathy watching that launch, I understood it as the zenith of American pain: that you should be, in the same breath, denied your rights, assured of your smallness, and awarded front-row tickets to combustive, deafening glory.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Kathleen Alcott</strong> is the author of the critically acclaimed novels America Was Hard to Find, Infinite Home and The Dangers of Proximal Alphabets</em><br></p></li> </ul>",

The black sky as seen from that planet, Alan Bean said, on the phone from Texas, was \u201cglossy\u201d like \u201cpatent leather\u201d. It\u2019s a recording I\u2019ve listened to many times since, trying to understand the particular solitude of the mid-century astronaut, a person who could explore another world while his own spun in flames. As a girl raised in the fallout of liberal northern California\u2019s anti-war revolution, men like him had always been objects of disdain to me \u2013 products of the military-industrial complex, upholders of white patriarchy \u2013 though somehow their achievements, the spacesuits and rockets, had escaped my scorn. But as research for my novel about the Apollo program deepened, a strange inversion was taking place: I was coming to revere the men who defined it, whose conservative politics I despised, but coming to question what they\u2019d done, the celestial explorations I\u2019d always assumed existed outside of politics. As though you could understand the unhappiness of a marriage by the details of an affair that went on outside of it, my understanding of the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s had always come directly from the left-most, long-haired side of it, the stories and biases of my parents, people who had lived excessively and died young, their memories of that time never more than a happy tap of the ashtray away. They met as reporters at the Oakland Tribune in 1987, he a member of the Silent Generation conditioned to petrify his ideas in private, she a Boomer who lived like a slogan, bold and loud. She danced to the Dead, making strange shapes in the air, and he read about the nature of time, making trippy notes in the margins. Where her rebellion was public and bodily, his was existential and sub rosa, and the compound result, in their parenting, was that I was never asked to brush my hair, but always required to have an opinion. As a child, I felt an outsider\u2019s near erotic longing at the idea of things like made beds and time-outs. The year I was seven, I sobbed at the incorrect clock on my mother\u2019s kitchen wall \u2013 red and white and never changed for daylight savings \u2013 already beginning to believe that only the small organizations of life might protect us against the meaner waves of it. Twenty-odd years later, reading about the psychological testing Neil Armstrong endured in the brutalist Nasa complex in Houston, I felt a deep serenity.

In the image of that man in the quiet of that black, he is only a body, his mind secondary to his circumstances, and there was a peace in that I could not ignore, a dissolution of ego I had not expected to find on the political side of polished shoes and war mongering. Somehow, that story was an antidote to the pain I felt as the child of individualists, always loved but often forgotten, deciding to walk when the car was late or didn\u2019t show, left alone in my afternoon and my thinking. My father would have called that time Armstrong spent in a room depersonalization, a favorite invective, an insult leveled by his hero Norman Mailer at the Apollo astronauts (\u201cthey were depersonalized to the extent they were true Christians,\u201d he wrote in Life in 1967), but to me it seemed a great feat to forget yourself, an enlightenment purer than that possible on the LSD and psilocybin my parents espoused. Taking syringeful after syringeful of ice cold water in his ear, sitting in a room of 120F, doing all of it without so much as a raise in his heart rate: Armstrong had stepped into the void without help, had approached and chosen it. But if my childhood loved this part of the research \u2013 about the mental purity of the other side, the focus possible when the individual was done away with \u2013 my adulthood kept pulling on another thread. The deeper I looked, a sinister shadow followed the light of the program\u2019s marvels: courting the descriptions of something called \u201cearthshine\u201d, the strange charred smells of lunar dust, the Astrud Gilberto cassette tapes and family photos brought to the moon, were machinations of war and cries of injustice. There was the fact that in 1962, the year he gave his famous address at Rice University and secured a blank check from Congress to land a man on the moon, Kennedy had already approved 3,205 American \u201cadvisers\u201d to the government of South Vietnam, as well as the use of the dioxin Agent Orange. There was the fact that the brilliant rocket engineers whom that blank check paid were Nazis, Wernher von Braun and Arthur Rudolph, the project that showcased their talents the V-2 rocket that killed 30,000 \u2013 built by forced Jewish laborers from the concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora. No matter how I loved the image of the Apollo 11 launch \u2013 a million exultant people transforming the beaches, binoculars held aloft from yachts where they drank Chardonnay or trucks where they tailgated with Budweiser \u2013 there was the fact that the evening before, the civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy led a group of 500 activists behind mule-drawn carts to meet with Nasa\u2019s deputy administrator, Thomas Paine. One fifth of the country was living without proper healthcare, food and shelter, Abernathy pointed out, an inordinate portion of them black. \u201cI am here,\u201d he said, \u201cto demonstrate with poor people in a symbolic way against the tragic and inexcusable gulf that exists between America\u2019s technological abilities and our social injustices.\u201d The year before, he had held Martin Luther King Jr as he bled to death, and he must have wondered where that image fit in the minds of the audience. \u201cBillions for space, the signs said. Pennies for the hungry.\u201d A note I\u2019d made, about a GI who confronted Neil Armstrong during a GSO tour \u2013 why, he wanted to know, was his country \u201cso interested in the moon instead of the conflict in Vietnam\u201d \u2013 grew different legs, walking across the page to affix itself to something Alan Bean had said: asked about how the Earth looked from the moon, he had two words: \u201cDisappointingly small.\u201d No more bread and circuses, went an anti-Apollo protest chant, referencing the Roman poet Juvenal, his polemic against the grain subsidy autocrats afforded the lower classes in an attempt to subdue them. Even if I set aside the issue of money \u2013 $24bn spent on the program, in 1973 currency, or roughly $150bn today \u2013 there was the purer question of American attention, how we guided it. In an era of limited airtime, was the color and sound spent on astronauts and their wives and children something like a crime? Was it agitprop, a western for the cold war audience that made no mention of certain earthly atrocities \u2013 of the black military companies who suffered gangrene for lack of the fresh socks their white peers received, of the systematic environmental devastation of a country smaller than California, of children killed and mutilated by teenagers? To say so would be easy, and you might mention the camp and artificiality shot through all things Apollo \u2013 the telescopic arm designed to hold up a flag in a place without wind, the golf ball Alan Shepard teed off the lunar surface, the basalt craters Nasa named the Sea of Fertility. In Kennedy\u2019s address that made all that came possible, given 18 months after the early stain on his presidency that was the Bay of Pigs and five weeks shy of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he does a funny thing with progress, asking the audience to consider all achievements of man as happening in the last 50 years: \u201cChristianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year \u2026 Newton explored the meaning of gravity \u2026 Only last week did we discover penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now, if America\u2019s new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.\u201d Entreating his country in this way, playing that trick with time, he rang a prominent bell in the American psyche: to be a part of a superpower is to be a part of history, and the temptation, in playing a minor part of history, is to see other lives, other parts, as minor \u2013 over and absorbed, after all, in a few relative turns of the planet. It is also, perhaps, to hope less for yourself. Looking back on his position in history, Alan Bean was practical and pragmatic. In training, he said, you replicated all possible smells, the feeling of the spacesuit air conditioner mounted on your back, the half-second delay of communications between Earth and not Earth, so that you could linger in other observations. \u201cThe sun was much brighter than it ever seemed in training on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shadows were much darker.\u201d Thinking of the freedom in this \u2013 planning so well, knowing so much, that you needed only notice flexions in light \u2013 and wanting to string a line from one side of my country to the other, I tried to liken those impressions of darkness to the sort of enlightenment I inevitably chased, the other worlds on Earth that I went after. I tried psychedelics first at 15, not long after my father died in his armchair, still surrounded by Carlos Castaneda paperbacks and printouts of Pete Seeger lyrics he\u2019d pinned up in his cluttered rental. I remembered a morning, in an isolated beach town known for removing the signs that announced it, that I left my place by the ocean in search of some water I could drink. I\u2019d eaten acid all night, spoken very little, and I was close to naked as I walked uphill through the sunrise and mist, wearing only someone else\u2019s cut off sweatshirt. The pink of the sky felt like a taste in my mouth, and the sound of the birds like something I could see, their chirp responsible for the movement of leaves. On the side of a one-storey church, which was white and wooden and peaked with a small belfry, I uncurled a green hose and drank a long time. When a woman with a key ring appeared, waving in a kind of admonishment, she seemed like my invention, something that had formed in my careful study of the fog. How did I seem to her, my eyes enormous and empty, the water I\u2019d been desperate for spilled down that dirty, sandy cotton? It must have appeared I\u2019d forgotten everything \u2013 my shoes, my manners, the school day that was about to begin without me \u2013 except the first and most primal needs of my accidental life. To identify the ligature between those trips, deep into space or deep into the mind, to find the thread between the bell sleeves and roach clips that were my mother\u2019s country and the 4am steak-and-egg breakfasts that were Alan Bean\u2019s, was not to understand two American cultures \u2013 one who waged war under the guise of protecting democracy, the other who used democracy to denounce that war \u2013 but to clearly see a certain American problem of the self. If the goal of one side was total control of the mind, the goal of the other total freedom, the crucial tools involved were never really the systems or institutions \u2013 the military or government, the school or church \u2013 that supported or repressed those ends. They were always the inner resources of one, for the United States has always been a country that tends to leave you, in so many ways, alone. Alone without a doctor, alone without a union, alone without a guaranteed education, and alone without much of a history, a record so short that what stands out are always the personalities that rose above it \u2013 not the six Apollo landings made possible by Nasa, but Armstrong\u2019s laconic announcement during one of them; not the systematic redlining of cities, which kept black Americans from home ownership, but a few soundbites of Martin Luther King to be played exactly once a year in a country that hasn\u2019t changed enough since he died for it. By the time Bean died, in 2018, the novel was done but the facts remained in my mind unarranged, something like the last things unpacked in a move between very different buildings, fragile, difficult to display in another setting. The sickness of my young country, what it did to people, what it allowed them to do, couldn\u2019t be explained by statistics of armament or dissent, although there was a story I read that stuck with me, a narrative of ameliorative diversion that held the whole Apollo program in its speculative palm. The anecdote is simple: an 18-year-old boy, about to be deployed in 1969, a bag slung over the shoulder of his uniform, calls through the open front door to the driveway where his mother\u2019s car is idling. He wants a few more minutes in front of the television, where Neil Armstrong has just taken his step, and though they\u2019re very late she allows him that, hoping maybe, if he feels the satiety of wonder at what his country has done, he might be able to get some sleep, something he\u2019s been missing given what his country has asked him to do. While it\u2019s certain the war crimes of My Lai or Khe Sanh would have occurred with or without a grand and expensive show going on in the sky above them, it might be true that it did something for how Americans treated each other, then. Answering Ralph Abernathy, Thomas Paine said: \u201cIf we could solve the problems of poverty by not pushing the button to launch men to the moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button.\u201d He asked that the leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center \u201cregard the space program \u2026 as an encouraging demonstration of what the American people could accomplish when they had vision, leadership and adequate resources,\u201d and to pray for the safety of the astronauts. Finally, he offered Abernathy and the activists VIP seating to watch the Saturn lift off, and the two peaceably shook hands. Thinking of Abernathy watching that launch, I understood it as the zenith of American pain: that you should be, in the same breath, denied your rights, assured of your smallness, and awarded front-row tickets to combustive, deafening glory.

Host Jesse Waters played down \u201cSend her back!\u201d by comparing it with sport: \u201cNow I don\u2019t know about you guys, but have you guys ever been to a football game? They chant some pretty bad stuff at a football game. Politics is a tough sport.\u201d Fox News seems to have hardened its pro-Trump stance over the years. Brian Stelter, chief media correspondent at cable news rival CNN, used his nightly newsletter to highlight a tweet by Murdoch from four years ago that said: \u201cWhen is Donald Trump going to stop embarrassing his friends, let alone the whole country?\u201d It was a response to a Trump spat with war hero John McCain. Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly also took Trump to task over the comment, Stelter noted. \u201cCompare that to how Murdoch\u2019s outlets have covered Trump\u2019s racist comments,\u201d he added. \u201cFox\u2019s opinion stars have defended Trump\u2019s comments, even at times laughing them off. It\u2019s even possible Tucker Carlson\u2019s commentary on Rep Ilhan Omar led to Trump\u2019s racist outburst.\u201d Dan Cassino, a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University and author of Fox News and American Politics: How One Channel Shapes American Politics and Society, said: \u201cI think the tweets were driven by the amount of coverage. We know President Trump watches a lot of Fox News and in the past couple of weeks Fox has spent a lot of time talking about the four Congresswomen.\u201d He said: \u201cFox has chosen them as the people they\u2019re going to demonize; a few years ago it was Hillary Clinton.\u201d",

Conservative rebels are among MPs who have moved to stymie Boris Johnson by voting to block any attempt to suspend parliament and force through a no-deal Brexit. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, vowed to \u201cfight no deal every inch of the way\u201d as he and three other cabinet ministers abstained and let the vote pass in a defeat for the government.

Listen, I\u2019m not an authority on that subject, but there are men and women \u2026 there\u2019s one thing they want and that\u2019s all they want, whether it\u2019s money or sex or power. And that was John.\u201d Sport JB Holmes heads into the second day of the Open holding the lead at Royal Portrush after a day that was among the worst of Rory McIlroy\u2019s career to date. World time-trial champion Rohan Dennis has wished his teammates well for the rest of the Tour de France but offered no insight as to why he quit the race dramatically on stage 12, which was won by Britain\u2019s Simon Yates. Ellyse Perry scored 84 not out and had a century partnership with Rachael Haynes as England toiled for 100 overs against ruthless Australia on the first day of the Women\u2019s Ashes Test at Taunton. England\u2019s 58-47 victory over South Africa means they will now face New Zealand in the semi-finals of the Netball World Cup. Great Britain is on course to send its biggest team to an overseas Olympics, with the aim of staying in the \u201cupper echelons\u201d of the medal table at Tokyo 2020. The young St-\u00c9tienne centre-back William Saliba has decided to join Arsenal despite a late attempt by Tottenham to sign the France under-20 international. And Zimbabwe\u2019s participation in the upcoming World T20 qualifiers is in doubt after the International Cricket Council suspended their membership. Business The grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets has cost the company $5.6bn in \u201cpotential concessions and other considerations to customers\u201d, with the impact of reduced production also contributing to the losses. Hints from the US Federal Reserve that it could cut rates by 0.5% later this month have given Asian stocks a big boost overnight, Tokyo leading the way with a jump of 2%. The FTSE100 is set to benefit from the prospect of looser monetary policy as well and is seen rising 0.42% at the opening. The pound is at $1.243 and \u20ac1.114. The papers The Commons vote aimed at preventing the UK leaving the EU with no deal is the main story on many front pages. The Guardian has \u201cTory rebels send stark warning to Johnson over no-deal Brexit\u201d and the FT says \u201cTory rebels check Johnson threat to force through no-deal Brexit\u201d. Others prefer the line that it was effectively a first defeat for PM-elect Boris Johnson. \u201cNo-deal mutiny: Johnson\u2019s first defeat,\u201d says the i while the Metro has \u201cFirst revolt against new PM\u201d. The Telegraph has another way in: \u201cHammond stirs up trouble for Boris in Brexit parting shot\u201d. The Express conjures up a positive splash for Johnson, with him telling the paper: \u201cNobody should sell their home for dementia care costs\u201d. The Times has the rebellion tale on the front but leads with \u201cMay gives \u00a32bn pay rise to public sector workers\u201d. The Mail goes for \u201c1 in 3 dementia victims forced to sell homes\u201d. The Sun leads with a story about TV presenter Ant McPartlin back behind the wheel after his driving ban: \u201cDrive carefully, Ant\u201d.

The department wrongly kept the former navy chief\u2019s diary secret from Patrick and was ordered to hand over the document in May. Patrick says the department\u2019s \u201cmodus operandi\u201d was to delay FOI requests until the information became stale and irrelevant. The future submarines request was first lodged in May 2017, and is still not fully resolved more than two years later. \u201cTheir standard operating procedure is to initially make a number of broad and cavalier claims [for withholding the documents],\u201d he said. \u201cWhen challenged they then reduce the number of claims and bunker down for a long and protracted legal fight, engaging the Australian Government Solicitor at a cost to the taxpayer. \u201cThey nimbly change exemption claim when they realise they are staring at a loss before the Information Commissioner or Administrative Appeals Tribunal. \u201cThe minister needs to order a joint strike on the FOI division using \u2018culture changing\u2019 cruise missiles.\u201d A spokeswoman for the defence department said: \u201cDefence is aware of the information commissioner\u2019s decision and is considering its position.\u201d The department can appeal the OAIC finding to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. ASC is now playing a limited role in the future submarines project. In February, it announced a partnership with the Naval Group on some aspects of the project, including workforce development, workplace safety training and services, and supply chain services.",

From April\u2019s guilt over her initial suspicions (\u201cWhat a horrible person, to think that about your dad\u201d) to him laughing nervously at the police as they begin their investigations into the case, the first episode has plenty to hook listeners in. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.spectacularfailures.org/\">Spectacular Failures</a></strong></p> <p>\u201cTry again.

According to Bloomberg, the tech giant is in conversation with media companies about creating shows exclusive to Apple podcasts. It follows a similar move by the music streaming service Spotify and continues Apple\u2019s efforts to move into \u201ccontent\u201d following the launch of Apple TV+. On a podcast-adjacent subject, last weekend\u2019s Guardian\u2019s Review supplement has looked at the booming appeal of audiobooks, considering the source of their popularity as well as highlighting some of the year\u2019s best. Meanwhile, the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime author Mark Haddon writes on why he can\u2019t stop listening to them. Picks of the week The Clearing April Balascio was always suspicious of her father\u2019s temper and habit of making the family move house every few months. But when she was 42, she discovered that Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer. Now her story is the subject of Gimlet\u2019s new true-crime podcast. From April\u2019s guilt over her initial suspicions (\u201cWhat a horrible person, to think that about your dad\u201d) to him laughing nervously at the police as they begin their investigations into the case, the first episode has plenty to hook listeners in. Hannah Verdier Spectacular Failures \u201cTry again. Fail again. Fail better,\u201d said Samuel Beckett, very much ahead of 2019\u2019s trend for admitting your screw-ups (see also Elizabeth Day\u2019s How to Fail podcast). Where bankrupt or crisis-hit business is concerned, however, there is often less empathy and more schadenfreude.

      "body": "<p>A conversation with Alec Baldwin feels rather like being in a holding pattern above New York. Not that it\u2019s boring: on the contrary, talking with this old-fashioned film star and modern-day sitcom god, this part-time Trump antagonist and full-time schmoozy showbiz personality, is an entirely pleasant experience. You are in business class, perhaps even first, and you are happy and sated and stimulated. Spread out invitingly below you are the twinkling lights of Manhattan, where the 61-year-old actor and his 35-year-old wife, Hilaria, own a penthouse apartment. (They also have an 18th-century farmhouse in the Hamptons.) And yet a question presents itself, not unreasonably, as the plane circles the city and each new circumnavigation seems to bring it no closer to terra firma: are we ever going to land?</p> <p>It is something to do with the circuitous nature of Baldwin\u2019s sentences, the way he riffs and waffles and meanders at will. Nothing can interrupt him, apart from his pets. (\u201cHold on a second,\u201d he says down the line from New York, and then I hear the words \u201cGirls! Come!\u201d before he returns to the phone to tell me he was \u201cjust summoning my dogs\u201d.) It is his appearance in the new docudrama <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6256978/\" title=\"\">Framing John DeLorean</a> that has occasioned our conversation today. In bite-sized dramatic reconstructions peppered among interviews with the subject\u2019s family and colleagues, Baldwin plays the late automobile executive and inventor, whose gull-winged car was turned into a time machine in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/back-to-the-future\" title=\"\">Back to the Future</a> but whose life was destroyed by ambition, stupidity and greed. It\u2019s a compelling story that starts with DeLorean relinquishing his position as group executive at General Motors to start his own company and ends with his naive involvement in a cocaine-smuggling operation exposed in an FBI sting.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1noZJUBbkNs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1noZJUBbkNs?start=18&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=18\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Baldwin has said he feels differently about DeLorean every day, so I ask where his head is at right now. \u201cWith John \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said this before \u2013 and I\u2019m not just saying this to, um, delight <em>you</em> and freshen up this material for this interview \u2013 but lately when I think about him \u2013 and I\u2019ve been talking about him a lot \u2013 I have friends and acquaintances who\u2019ve seen the film, and we go out to dinner and discuss it \u2013 I find that beyond anyone who\u2019s \u2013 oh, I don\u2019t know \u2013 committed <em>murder</em> or they\u2019re a <em>sex</em> trafficker \u2013 I kind of look at John as a victim.\u201d</p> <p>I am trying to fathom the \u201csex trafficker\u201d comment but he has already moved on. \u201cNow, granted, this sounds like I\u2019m being overly colourful. But he\u2019s a victim of his own ambition. He\u2019s an American businessman and that comes with a whole menu of options. American businesses have changed the world \u2013 they\u2019ve fostered innovation on a level that\u2019s unseen \u2013 and they\u2019re also responsible for a lot of the horrific pollution and climate change and plastics pollution \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t want to go on and on with that list \u2013 and DeLorean is someone who made a lot of poor choices. His family, reputation, his own health, all fell victim to that soaring ambition.\u201d</p> <p>Baldwin himself had one interaction with the real DeLorean: a late-night phone call in 2004 in which the fallen automobile giant suggested that the actor might like to play him in a movie. \u201cNo one was approaching me from a network or a studio. It was all hypothetical. John\u2019s hand was in this because he was an uber control freak. I never heard from him again, and then he died the following year.\u201d</p> <p>For the film\u2019s reconstructions, Baldwin wears facial prosthetics, a silver wig and a pair of thick black slabs for eyebrows. I bring up the subject of makeup but all this does is prompt one of those ruminations, which ends, with Baldwinian inevitability, in him comparing his treatment unfavourably with that of a more successful actor. \u201cI wish we could have gone further,\u201d he sighs. \u201cThe hair and makeup people said they could do a detailed version that would take three hours to apply. The director said: \u2018Give us the best you can in two hours.\u2019 I was looking at some stills of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/christian-bale-dick-cheney-movie\" title=\"\">Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in Vice</a> \u2013 I admire Bale so much \u2013 and when you have as much skill as Bale, and they get it just-so \u2026\u201d He trails off, then picks up the thought again with a note of faintly smouldering resentment. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t rush <em>him</em> out of the makeup chair.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f0bb0c9dd57501d273225148d21580f70d26c3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f0bb0c9dd57501d273225148d21580f70d26c3e/0_177_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alec Baldwin in Framing John Delorean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baldwin, complete with fake eyebrows and silver wig, in Framing John Delorean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Rivelli/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>DeLorean once said that no man without a strong sex drive ever accomplished anything, so I ask Baldwin whether he agrees. \u201cWhat an English question,\u201d he says, with a booming laugh. \u201cWhat a naughty, naughty English question that is. You could fold the sex into anything, couldn\u2019t you? You could fold the sex into dentistry. Listen, I\u2019m not an authority on that subject, but there are men and women who want what they want, and that is a shotgun for them: they want art, they want palaces, they want people, they <em>collect</em> people, they collect children and wives. They have a reality that burns out and then they dust themselves off and start all over again. And then there are people who are laser-like. There\u2019s one thing they want and that\u2019s <em>all</em> they want, whether it\u2019s money or sex or power. And that was John.\u201d</p> <p>There is no mystery about which category Baldwin falls into. After the wreckage of his divorce from the actor Kim Basinger in the early 2000s, and the catastrophic fallout when an <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/alec-baldwin-speaks-out-voicemail-daughter\" title=\"\">enraged voicemail</a> he had left for their then-11-year-old daughter found its way online (in the recording, he branded her a \u201crude, thoughtless little pig\u201d), he went through a period of what he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/16/alec-baldwin-i-was-staring-off-a-cliff\" title=\"\">called</a> \u201cstaring off a cliff\u201d. And then he did indeed start all over again with Hilaria, with whom he now has four children under the age of 10. </p> <p>His career has always seemed so diffuse. Who knows what he ever wanted? He has been a theatre actor, a film and TV star, hosted a quiz show and presided over his own chatshows, as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TabhV7hN7w\" title=\"\">Alec Baldwin\u2019s Love Ride</a>, in which he dispenses relationship advice to couples from the back of a limousine (\u201cIt\u2019s the silliest thing you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d). There is also a podcast, <a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/heresthething\" title=\"\">Here\u2019s the Thing</a>, with a slate of guests including everyone from Itzhak Perlman to Sarah Jessica Parker, Bernie Sanders to Ben and Jerry. If he never gives another great performance again it won\u2019t matter: he is having a blast playing Alec Baldwin, a role that, as a younger man, he appeared often to despise.</p> <p>Following a stint in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageLadyBoners/comments/66lpl0/alec_baldwin_as_billy_allison_aldrich_from_the_tv/\" title=\"\">soap opera</a> in the early 1980s, he briefly became an actor to be reckoned with, performing David Mamet, Joe Orton and Caryl Churchill on stage, and working with Tim Burton, Jonathan Demme and Mike Nichols in the early years of his film career. But the Basinger era, and his own consuming anger, came to define him in the public consciousness far more than any of his performances, with the exception perhaps of the shark-like sales executive who dominates the <a href=\"https://film.avclub.com/why-glengarry-glen-ross-alec-baldwin-scene-is-so-unusu-1798232383\" title=\"\">opening scene</a> of the 1992 film of Mamet\u2019s Glengarry Glen Ross. Then again, that movie wasn\u2019t playing on a loop on the front pages of every tabloid at America\u2019s supermarket checkouts, the way his divorce later did.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbN9LbuBHk0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LbN9LbuBHk0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch Baldwin in Glengary Glen Ross</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Likewise, Baldwin\u2019s onscreen achievements \u2013 his Oscar nomination for playing an unscrupulous casino boss in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s33dP0ETrCo\" title=\"\">The Cooler</a> or his collaborations with Martin Scorsese (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiWlvGijfOQ\" title=\"\">The Aviator</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r46JtPDtqAk\" title=\"\">The Departed</a>) and Woody Allen (three films including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FER3C394aI8\" title=\"\">Blue Jasmine</a>) \u2013 have usually been eclipsed by his intemperate comments and displays of aggression. Most actors of his stature and experience make the headlines for winning awards; losing his temper is more Baldwin\u2019s thing. Only this year he <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/23/entertainment/alec-baldwin-court-appearance/index.html\" title=\"\">pleaded guilty to harassment</a> and agreed to take an anger management course after an argument over a Manhattan parking space.

      "bodyText": "A conversation with Alec Baldwin feels rather like being in a holding pattern above New York. Not that it\u2019s boring: on the contrary, talking with this old-fashioned film star and modern-day sitcom god, this part-time Trump antagonist and full-time schmoozy showbiz personality, is an entirely pleasant experience. You are in business class, perhaps even first, and you are happy and sated and stimulated. Spread out invitingly below you are the twinkling lights of Manhattan, where the 61-year-old actor and his 35-year-old wife, Hilaria, own a penthouse apartment. (They also have an 18th-century farmhouse in the Hamptons.) And yet a question presents itself, not unreasonably, as the plane circles the city and each new circumnavigation seems to bring it no closer to terra firma: are we ever going to land? It is something to do with the circuitous nature of Baldwin\u2019s sentences, the way he riffs and waffles and meanders at will. Nothing can interrupt him, apart from his pets. (\u201cHold on a second,\u201d he says down the line from New York, and then I hear the words \u201cGirls! Come!\u201d before he returns to the phone to tell me he was \u201cjust summoning my dogs\u201d.) It is his appearance in the new docudrama Framing John DeLorean that has occasioned our conversation today. In bite-sized dramatic reconstructions peppered among interviews with the subject\u2019s family and colleagues, Baldwin plays the late automobile executive and inventor, whose gull-winged car was turned into a time machine in Back to the Future but whose life was destroyed by ambition, stupidity and greed. It\u2019s a compelling story that starts with DeLorean relinquishing his position as group executive at General Motors to start his own company and ends with his naive involvement in a cocaine-smuggling operation exposed in an FBI sting. Baldwin has said he feels differently about DeLorean every day, so I ask where his head is at right now. \u201cWith John \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said this before \u2013 and I\u2019m not just saying this to, um, delight you and freshen up this material for this interview \u2013 but lately when I think about him \u2013 and I\u2019ve been talking about him a lot \u2013 I have friends and acquaintances who\u2019ve seen the film, and we go out to dinner and discuss it \u2013 I find that beyond anyone who\u2019s \u2013 oh, I don\u2019t know \u2013 committed murder or they\u2019re a sex trafficker \u2013 I kind of look at John as a victim.\u201d I am trying to fathom the \u201csex trafficker\u201d comment but he has already moved on. \u201cNow, granted, this sounds like I\u2019m being overly colourful. But he\u2019s a victim of his own ambition. He\u2019s an American businessman and that comes with a whole menu of options. American businesses have changed the world \u2013 they\u2019ve fostered innovation on a level that\u2019s unseen \u2013 and they\u2019re also responsible for a lot of the horrific pollution and climate change and plastics pollution \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t want to go on and on with that list \u2013 and DeLorean is someone who made a lot of poor choices. His family, reputation, his own health, all fell victim to that soaring ambition.\u201d Baldwin himself had one interaction with the real DeLorean: a late-night phone call in 2004 in which the fallen automobile giant suggested that the actor might like to play him in a movie. \u201cNo one was approaching me from a network or a studio. It was all hypothetical. John\u2019s hand was in this because he was an uber control freak. I never heard from him again, and then he died the following year.\u201d For the film\u2019s reconstructions, Baldwin wears facial prosthetics, a silver wig and a pair of thick black slabs for eyebrows. I bring up the subject of makeup but all this does is prompt one of those ruminations, which ends, with Baldwinian inevitability, in him comparing his treatment unfavourably with that of a more successful actor. \u201cI wish we could have gone further,\u201d he sighs. \u201cThe hair and makeup people said they could do a detailed version that would take three hours to apply. The director said: \u2018Give us the best you can in two hours.\u2019 I was looking at some stills of Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in Vice \u2013 I admire Bale so much \u2013 and when you have as much skill as Bale, and they get it just-so \u2026\u201d He trails off, then picks up the thought again with a note of faintly smouldering resentment. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t rush him out of the makeup chair.\u201d DeLorean once said that no man without a strong sex drive ever accomplished anything, so I ask Baldwin whether he agrees. \u201cWhat an English question,\u201d he says, with a booming laugh. \u201cWhat a naughty, naughty English question that is. You could fold the sex into anything, couldn\u2019t you? You could fold the sex into dentistry. Listen, I\u2019m not an authority on that subject, but there are men and women who want what they want, and that is a shotgun for them: they want art, they want palaces, they want people, they collect people, they collect children and wives. They have a reality that burns out and then they dust themselves off and start all over again. And then there are people who are laser-like. There\u2019s one thing they want and that\u2019s all they want, whether it\u2019s money or sex or power. And that was John.\u201d There is no mystery about which category Baldwin falls into. After the wreckage of his divorce from the actor Kim Basinger in the early 2000s, and the catastrophic fallout when an enraged voicemail he had left for their then-11-year-old daughter found its way online (in the recording, he branded her a \u201crude, thoughtless little pig\u201d), he went through a period of what he has called \u201cstaring off a cliff\u201d. And then he did indeed start all over again with Hilaria, with whom he now has four children under the age of 10. His career has always seemed so diffuse. Who knows what he ever wanted? He has been a theatre actor, a film and TV star, hosted a quiz show and presided over his own chatshows, as well as Alec Baldwin\u2019s Love Ride, in which he dispenses relationship advice to couples from the back of a limousine (\u201cIt\u2019s the silliest thing you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d). There is also a podcast, Here\u2019s the Thing, with a slate of guests including everyone from Itzhak Perlman to Sarah Jessica Parker, Bernie Sanders to Ben and Jerry. If he never gives another great performance again it won\u2019t matter: he is having a blast playing Alec Baldwin, a role that, as a younger man, he appeared often to despise. Following a stint in soap opera in the early 1980s, he briefly became an actor to be reckoned with, performing David Mamet, Joe Orton and Caryl Churchill on stage, and working with Tim Burton, Jonathan Demme and Mike Nichols in the early years of his film career. But the Basinger era, and his own consuming anger, came to define him in the public consciousness far more than any of his performances, with the exception perhaps of the shark-like sales executive who dominates the opening scene of the 1992 film of Mamet\u2019s Glengarry Glen Ross. Then again, that movie wasn\u2019t playing on a loop on the front pages of every tabloid at America\u2019s supermarket checkouts, the way his divorce later did. Likewise, Baldwin\u2019s onscreen achievements \u2013 his Oscar nomination for playing an unscrupulous casino boss in The Cooler or his collaborations with Martin Scorsese (The Aviator, The Departed) and Woody Allen (three films including Blue Jasmine) \u2013 have usually been eclipsed by his intemperate comments and displays of aggression. Most actors of his stature and experience make the headlines for winning awards; losing his temper is more Baldwin\u2019s thing. Only this year he pleaded guilty to harassment and agreed to take an anger management course after an argument over a Manhattan parking space. He has also been arrested for disorderly conduct, had a chatshow cancelled after he used a homophobic slur against a paparazzo, and been kicked off a flight for refusing to stop using his phone prior to takeoff. If he is known for poor control of his impulses, he still has principles. He distinguished himself by refusing to join other former Woody Allen cast members (among them Colin Firth, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Greta Gerwig) in denouncing the legally exonerated film-maker. \u201cThere\u2019s a very small number of people who know what really happened in that situation,\u201d Baldwin tells me. \u201cOnly the people who were in that room can know for sure, but you have testimony for and against Woody from the same pool of people. One daughter is saying he\u2019s a sex offender; his other son has defended him. I have nothing but the most profound sympathy for anyone who was the victim of sex abuse, but I also have a bit of a conscience, if you will, about people who are falsely accused. That\u2019s tragic, too.\u201d When I ask how he feels about his friend, the film-maker James Toback, who has been accused of sexual assault or sexual harassment by 395 women, we are firmly back in the holding pattern again. \u201cThe only thing I have to say about that \u2013 like any of the other cases \u2013 is that there are people who have admirably brought that subject to the fore \u2013 whether it\u2019s Asia Argento or Rose McGowan, to name two of the most notable \u2013 and that moment seems to be slipping away. I hope we can rekindle it all, because it seems to be waning. If [Harvey] Weinstein is presumed to be low-hanging fruit, then why isn\u2019t he in a courtroom? The only person who\u2019s behind bars is [Bill] Cosby.\u201d Abruptly, he decides that he has had enough of that topic. \u201cWe\u2019re almost done,\u201d he announces, though in fact there are still 10 minutes remaining of our allotted time. \u201cWhat else have you got?\u201d What I want to hear about are the two roles that have done the most to bring Baldwin back from the brink, to dissuade the public from associating him with temper tantrums and divorce and bad parenting. The most recent is his Emmy-winning performance as Donald Trump, whom he plays on Saturday Night Live with one eyebrow permanently raised and both lips protruding as though trying to suck a lemon through a letterbox. What purpose does he feel his portrayal serves? \u201cAmong the American people, there is a level of disgust and even nausea about Trump. Just as his presidency is a chronic condition and it\u2019s not going away any time soon, so the humour \u2013 not just me, but all humour about Trump \u2013 is the medicine people are taking to quiet the nausea. It\u2019s a see-saw. I do SNL and then by Monday or Tuesday night, they wanna throw up all over again.\u201d Baldwin recalls once meeting E Jean Carroll, the columnist who alleges that she was raped by Trump in the mid-90s. \u201cI was introduced to her a few years ago when a friend of mine brought her to dinner at a small restaurant in New York, and nothing about that woman led me to believe she was a liar or a sociopath.

      "body": "<p>Sadiq Khan will demand an overhaul of tenancy laws in a campaign for London rent controls that is set to be the cornerstone of his 2020 re-election campaign.</p> <p>The London mayor has said he intends to introduce a London private rent commission, with a board that would include current renters, to enforce measures to reduce rents and keep them at lower levels, but he currently lacks the legal power to do so.</p> <p>Khan\u2019s demand is unlikely to be viewed sympathetically by the Conservative government, but the mayor will launch a report at City Hall on Friday setting out the new powers he would require and a blueprint for the overhaul of the rental sector.</p> <p>The report says the mayor is seeking devolved powers in order to:</p> <ul> <li><p>Establish a universal register of landlords to access valuable data as well as enforce standards.</p></li> <li><p>Establish a London private rent commission to design and implement an effective system of rent control.</p></li> <li><p>Implement simple rent stabilisation measures such as caps on rent increases while the commission is being created.</p></li> </ul> <p>The report says the average private rent for a one-bedroom home in London is now more than the average for a three-bed home in every other region of England. The proportion of Londoners renting privately has risen from 11% in 1990 to 26% last year.</p> <p>Polling by YouGov and City Hall suggests more than two-thirds of Londoners favour caps on the amount landlords can charge, similar to systems in Berlin and New York.</p> <p>In the German capital, which has recently announced a five-year rent freeze, rents are controlled both within and between tenancies. In New York City some apartments have their rents capped by a board.</p> <p>Khan said Scotland had recently introduced laws allowing councils to apply \u201crent pressure zones\u201d where rents could rise by no more than inflation, but the rest of England and Wales had very weak protections.</p> <p>\u201cIt is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,\u201d Khan said. \u201cUnlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That\u2019s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.\u201d</p> <p>The report, authored by the Labour MP Karen Buck and the deputy mayor, James Murray, draws on proposals from a study by the New Economics Foundation (NEF).</p> <p>Miatta Fahnbulleh, NEF\u2019s chief executive, said urgent and radical action was needed. She said: \u201cSince 2010 average rents have risen three times as fast as average incomes. The scale of this affordability crisis means that action must be taken. We support the mayor\u2019s call \u2013 drawn from NEF\u2019s proposals \u2013 for additional powers to design and roll out rent controls. With a majority of Londoners now in favour of rent control, we urge the government to grant the powers needed to the mayor to bring rents down to affordable levels for London\u2019s 2.4 million private renters.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Wilson Craw, the director of the housing campaign group Generation Rent, said the current state of the rental market meant a rented property could rarely be a true home. \u201cLondoners are being priced out of the neighbourhoods they grew up in, couples are delaying having kids and many tenants dare not complain about disrepair in case their landlord retaliates with a rent hike,\u201d he said. \u201cSadiq Khan recognises the ambition and urgency needed to improve life for private renters.

      "bodyText": "Sadiq Khan will demand an overhaul of tenancy laws in a campaign for London rent controls that is set to be the cornerstone of his 2020 re-election campaign. The London mayor has said he intends to introduce a London private rent commission, with a board that would include current renters, to enforce measures to reduce rents and keep them at lower levels, but he currently lacks the legal power to do so. Khan\u2019s demand is unlikely to be viewed sympathetically by the Conservative government, but the mayor will launch a report at City Hall on Friday setting out the new powers he would require and a blueprint for the overhaul of the rental sector. The report says the mayor is seeking devolved powers in order to: Establish a universal register of landlords to access valuable data as well as enforce standards. Establish a London private rent commission to design and implement an effective system of rent control. Implement simple rent stabilisation measures such as caps on rent increases while the commission is being created. The report says the average private rent for a one-bedroom home in London is now more than the average for a three-bed home in every other region of England. The proportion of Londoners renting privately has risen from 11% in 1990 to 26% last year. Polling by YouGov and City Hall suggests more than two-thirds of Londoners favour caps on the amount landlords can charge, similar to systems in Berlin and New York. In the German capital, which has recently announced a five-year rent freeze, rents are controlled both within and between tenancies. In New York City some apartments have their rents capped by a board. Khan said Scotland had recently introduced laws allowing councils to apply \u201crent pressure zones\u201d where rents could rise by no more than inflation, but the rest of England and Wales had very weak protections. \u201cIt is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,\u201d Khan said. \u201cUnlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That\u2019s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.\u201d The report, authored by the Labour MP Karen Buck and the deputy mayor, James Murray, draws on proposals from a study by the New Economics Foundation (NEF). Miatta Fahnbulleh, NEF\u2019s chief executive, said urgent and radical action was needed. She said: \u201cSince 2010 average rents have risen three times as fast as average incomes. The scale of this affordability crisis means that action must be taken. We support the mayor\u2019s call \u2013 drawn from NEF\u2019s proposals \u2013 for additional powers to design and roll out rent controls. With a majority of Londoners now in favour of rent control, we urge the government to grant the powers needed to the mayor to bring rents down to affordable levels for London\u2019s 2.4 million private renters.\u201d Dan Wilson Craw, the director of the housing campaign group Generation Rent, said the current state of the rental market meant a rented property could rarely be a true home. \u201cLondoners are being priced out of the neighbourhoods they grew up in, couples are delaying having kids and many tenants dare not complain about disrepair in case their landlord retaliates with a rent hike,\u201d he said. \u201cSadiq Khan recognises the ambition and urgency needed to improve life for private renters. We hope the new prime minister recognises this too and acts quickly.\u201d Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto included a pledge to \u201cintroduce controls on rent rises\u201d and to consider giving the mayor of London additional powers, given the particular pressures in the capital. The Tory mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey launched his own pledge on housing, proposing establishing a \u201ctaxpayer-owned housebuilder\u201d controlled by City Hall that would operate like a private sector firm. He said he would set \u201cno arbitrary target\u201d for the number of homes to be built and he pledged to reduce Khan\u2019s target for the proportion of \u201caffordable\u201d homes in developments from 50% to 35%. Bailey claimed this would result in more affordable homes being built overall, saying the target \u201cacts as a bar\u201d to housebuilding and was rarely being met. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said Khan\u2019s proposal was \u201ca wilfully misleading interpretation of the facts\u201d and said the government had taken \u201cunprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants\u201d including plans to abolish \u201cno-fault\u201d evictions and ending letting fees. \u201cTogether, these measures will create a housing market that truly works for everyone \u2013 in direct contrast to rent controls which could drive responsible landlords out, could reduce investment in high quality housing and ultimately push rents up.\u201d",

Both these initiatives were classic examples of local discretion leading to reform, where central government policy was stuck in a political rut.

      "bodyText": "Scotland\u2019s drug mortality rate cannot be shelved as just another misery statistic. It has risen by 27% in a year and is three times England and Wales\u2019s rate, 50 times Portugal\u2019s and higher even than that of the United States. Westminster is clearly deaf to this tragedy. There is only one solution. Declare it Scotland\u2019s problem. Let Scotland decide what to do. Every country in the developed world is now inquiring, experimenting, searching for how to tame the menace that modern narcotics pose. Every country, that is, except Britain, where for half a century a futile \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has been delegated to the police, the courts and the NHS. The sole beneficiaries have been drug dealers and their political sponsor, Her Majesty\u2019s Home Office, relieved of lifting a finger in response. There is now little point in preaching the gospel of legalisation. Countless seminars, conferences and inquiries have tried to work out how best to tackle Britain\u2019s booming drugs industry, legitimate and illicit. They never address the root of the trouble, the minds closed to the subject in Westminster and Whitehall. We can scream \u201clook to the Netherlands, Portugal, Canada, California\u201d, and MPs and officials clamp their hands to their ears. These people and not the addicts or dealers are Britain\u2019s drugs problem. It is their policies, dating from the antiquated 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, that underpin the street corner sales, powder factories, shooting galleries and lightly dusted lavatory seats of what the act has turned into a multibillion-pound underground industry. It is an industry Whitehall refuses to regulate, let alone tax. Public servants who, in their home life, may be open to reason, at work become architects of cruelty, well-illustrated in the cynical handling of last year\u2019s medical cannabis scandal, which is still unresolved. As in so many of areas of its responsibility, the Home Office displays the open-mindedness of a Spanish Inquisition. Reform must search for weaknesses in the wall of reaction. Chief weakness is the frontline, where criminalisation is collapsing through sheer unenforcibility. Led by Durham, one force after another is refusing to arrest its way out of the drugs problem. London\u2019s commissioner, Cressida Dick, says she would need \u201can army of 100,000 officers\u201d to seek out and charge all the capital\u2019s drug users. Anarchy may yet prove the most effective agent of change. But even an attempted shift from imprisonment to care and rehabilitation suffers from the steady closure of treatment centres under local authorities\u2019 austerity. Like ever rising drug abuse in prisons, it is as if British government was seeking to aid an industry with which it claims to be at war. Liberal Britain relieves its anti-Brexit fury by labelling Donald Trump\u2019s US antediluvian. Yet even Trump is not enforcing federal bans on states that experiment with cannabis law reform. Thirty-three states have legalised medicinal or recreational use, as has Canada. An industry worth many billions of dollars is going legitimate, as did alcohol with the end of prohibition. Visitors arriving at Los Angeles airport are greeted with an advertisement for California\u2019s chief marijuana retailer, MedMen. It reads: \u201cWelcome to the new normal.\u201d Half of Oakland\u2019s cannabis licences now go to formerly imprisoned dealers. Colorado, a state the same size as Scotland, reports revenue from its cannabis tax passing $1bn in five years of operation. Could Scotland not use such money? The American experience is not all roses. It has a huge \u201chard\u201d drug abuse problem, partly due to the introduction of new opioids and other substances. But slowly drugs are coming to be seen as a social, not a law-and-order issue, with control and legal regulation the sensible response. At least marijuana is being removed from the drugs cocktail. Research shows no rise in cannabis usage with legalisation, while California shows an 8% fall among teenage users. Britain is light years adrift of such reform. The one hope might be Scotland. It already enjoys a degree of devolved power over crime and punishment. This spring it publicised its remarkable success in combating knife killings. It had halved the rate in 10 years, largely thanks to violence reduction schemes copied from Los Angeles and Boston. Likewise, a campaign against alcohol-related deaths exploited delegated powers to levy local taxes. A rise in minimum retail prices has driven Scottish alcohol consumption to an all-time low. Both these initiatives were classic examples of local discretion leading to reform, where central government policy was stuck in a political rut. Yet, ever since devolution, the Home Office has refused to allow Scotland power to vary the 1971 drugs act. With its antique schedules and ineffective punishments, this act echoes the days of stocks, thumbscrews and treadmills. To the Home Office it is holy writ. Scotland has a desperate problem. Scenes of addicts on its streets will hardly attract investors, employers or tourists. Yet it has a mature administration with a proven readiness to search the world for solutions to its woes. Its police chiefs, law officers, academics and newspapers are pleading to be allowed to tackle the drugs crisis for themselves. Cannabis legalisation may be part of a solution. Prescription heroin and cocaine may be another. That should be for Scotland to decide. Parliament can keep to its medieval taboos. It can sail blithely on through its dark night of reaction. But it has failed utterly to win the war on drugs in Scotland. The least it can do is set Scotland free. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

I was blonde, I was young, I was thin, I wore the ladies\u2019 fashion clothes.\u201d But Northcutt learned to live with the attention. \u201cWell, of course I was being used,\u201d she told PBS. \u201cMy feeling was, you can play this both ways. The mere fact that a lot of women found out for the first time that there was a woman in mission control was a very big deal.\u201d After Nasa, Northcutt became an outspoken feminist and, as the first \u201cwomen\u2019s advocate\u201d in Houston, helped combat sex discrimination in the fire department. She went on to be a criminal defense lawyer and, now 74, is currently the president of the Texas chapter of the National Organization for Women. She told the Houston Oral History Project: \u201cI would have much preferred to have been the 10th or 20th [woman in mission control] because you do have to worry that people are going to say, \u2018Oh well, she couldn\u2019t cut it so other women can\u2019t come through this. That was part of my consciousness raising and part of the reason I became a feminist.\u201d JoAnn Morgan She endured obscene phone calls, lewd comments in the elevator and having to leave the building where she worked in search of a female bathroom. But on 16 July 1969, JoAnn Morgan was the only woman in the launch firing room for the Apollo 11 liftoff. A self-described \u201cprecocious little kid\u201d, Morgan began working for Nasa in 1958 while still in college. The Nasa website recounts: \u201cMorgan heard later from colleagues that when she was hired to join the team, her immediate supervisor, Jim White, called everyone for a meeting \u2013 except her. As the room filled with men, White explained to the crew: \u201c\u2018This is a young lady who wants to be an engineer. You\u2019re to treat her like an engineer. But she\u2019s not your buddy. You call her Ms Hardin. You\u2019re not to be familiar.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Well, can we ask her to make coffee?\u2019 someone asked. \u201c\u2018No,\u2019 White said. \u2018You don\u2019t ask an engineer to make coffee.\u2019\u201d It was therefore little surprise that Morgan usually got the overnight shift ahead of launches, making way for a male colleague a few hours before the grand spectacle. But when it came to the big one, she got her big break as instrumentation controller. Among the familiar rows of white short-sleeved shirts and dark ties, she is the solitary woman visible inside Nasa\u2019s firing room for the launch of Apollo 11. She told the Associated Press: \u201cI was there. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. I had a real passion for it. Finally, 99% of them accepted that \u2018JoAnn\u2019s here and we\u2019re stuck with her.\u2019\u201d Once the launch was safely under way, Morgan and her husband, Larry, a school band director, went on holiday and watched the 20 July moon landing on a hotel TV. As they toasted the first lunar footsteps, he told her: \u201cHoney, you\u2019re going to be in the history books.\u201d Her Nasa career spanned 45 years and she became the first female senior executive at the Kennedy Space Center. Retired since 2003, she is now 78, divides her time between Florida and Montana and encourages young women to study engineering. She told the Nasa website: \u201cIt was just meant to be for me to be in the launching business. I\u2019ve got rocket fuel in my blood.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Queen\u2019s property manager has bowed to criticism over its plans for the biggest offshore wind auction in a decade by agreeing to fairer terms for renewable energy companies. The Crown Estate, which holds the rights to seabeds around the British Isles, told windfarm developers on Thursday that it has \u201crefined\u201d its controversial plans for the upcoming tender to make it more affordable to develop renewable energy. The crown stands to earn record sums from the offshore wind industry by auctioning off the seabed to major energy companies, but the plans were delayed by concerns that they amount to a \u201ccash grab\u201d for the royal coffers. The crown\u2019s change of tack comes after the Guardian revealed that the auction could raise hundreds of millions for the Queen while raising household energy bills. The Queen\u2019s estate broke with previous tender rounds by calling for companies to compete for a licence by submitting a sealed envelope bid, which it planned to use as the basis for a new, decade-long rent agreement too. The energy companies warned that this would raise their costs, which would ultimately be passed on to households through higher wind power subsidies. Announcing changes to the auction on Thursday, the Crown Estate said it would make the tender process more transparent by using daily bidding cycles. The change should allay industry fears of a \u201crunaway auction\u201d. It has also promised to scrap the hefty upfront payment in favour of annual payments over at least three years. Jonny Boston, the Crown Estate\u2019s business development manager, said: \u201cFollowing extensive engagement with the market, we have now further refined our tender design, in light of the feedback received. \u201cOur goal has been to design a process that is attractive, accessible and fair, supports the sustainable development of the seabed and ultimately delivers a robust pipeline of new projects that will help the UK\u2019s transition to a low carbon economy.\u201d The Crown Estate charges royalties equal to 2% of revenues for use of its seabeds, and collected \u00a341m from existing leases last year. This sum is expected to balloon as the offshore wind sector grows at pace. Currently the Queen\u2019s seabeds generate about 8% of the country\u2019s electricity, but that could increase to almost a third by 2030 under government targets. Barnaby Wharton, of RenewableUK, an industry trade association, said the changes showed that the Crown Estate \u201chas recognised a more transparent process is needed to avoid adding unnecessary costs\u201d. \u201cThat is welcome and should be the principle which guides the Crown Estate in implementing this new leasing process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that leasing for new offshore wind sites supports the right level of ambition to meet our net zero emissions target, while ensuring value for consumers.\u201d",

Since then, the essential naffness of Cats \u2013 the earnestness of its reconstituted TS Eliot poetry, combined with the clumsiness of its human-feline costumes \u2013 has served as satirical fodder in everything from The Simpsons to The Critic to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It\u2019s easy to be cynical about a Cats movie, then, in large part because a Cats movie seemed an absurd impossibility for so long. For all the popularity of its artifice-heavy stage treatment, there didn\u2019t seem to be a workable way of filming a show entirely about cats, but conveyed entirely through human emotion, expression and movement.</p> \n<p>Who could have guessed that 2019 would be the year to take up this challenge twice over? Tomorrow, Disney\u2019s much ballyhooed \u201clive-action\u201d remake of The Lion King hits cinemas, with its photo-real but computer-generated big cats improbably shaping their mouths around Elton John\u2019s rousing score score. In terms of online buzz, however, its thunder has almost been stolen this week by Cats, finally brought to the screen by the Oscar-winning British director Tom Hooper. It won\u2019t be in cinemas until December, but a calculated one-two punch \u2013 yesterday, a gushing behind-the-scenes featurette, today the official trailer in all its gaudy neon-lit glory \u2013 has held the internet rapt in semi-morbid fascination.</p> \n<p>At last, in two short but overwhelming minutes, the question of \u201chow the hell do you make a movie of Cats\u201d has been answered: by slathering an all-star cast that seems to have been assembled through a particularly manic game of Mad Libs (Judi Dench! Jennifer Hudson! Taylor Swift! Idris Elba!

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis Christmas, you will believe.\u201d With these words, Universal sent its first trailer for Cats out into the Twitterverse \u2013 and if a cagier strapline has appeared in modern movie marketing, nothing comes immediately to mind. Don\u2019t believe it now? Fine, you have until Christmas. One the one hand, it sounds a bit like a threat. On the other, maybe it\u2019s more of a plea. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a lot to take in right now, but give it a few months: you\u2019ll believe, we promise!\u201d To be fair, they have reason to, er, pussyfoot in their approach: a film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s eternally uncool but commercially deathless musical has been something of an industry joke for decades, most famous, of course, as a symbolic punchline in John Guare\u2019s Upper East Side bourgeoisie satire Six Degrees of Separation. Since then, the essential naffness of Cats \u2013 the earnestness of its reconstituted TS Eliot poetry, combined with the clumsiness of its human-feline costumes \u2013 has served as satirical fodder in everything from The Simpsons to The Critic to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It\u2019s easy to be cynical about a Cats movie, then, in large part because a Cats movie seemed an absurd impossibility for so long. For all the popularity of its artifice-heavy stage treatment, there didn\u2019t seem to be a workable way of filming a show entirely about cats, but conveyed entirely through human emotion, expression and movement. Who could have guessed that 2019 would be the year to take up this challenge twice over? Tomorrow, Disney\u2019s much ballyhooed \u201clive-action\u201d remake of The Lion King hits cinemas, with its photo-real but computer-generated big cats improbably shaping their mouths around Elton John\u2019s rousing score score. In terms of online buzz, however, its thunder has almost been stolen this week by Cats, finally brought to the screen by the Oscar-winning British director Tom Hooper. It won\u2019t be in cinemas until December, but a calculated one-two punch \u2013 yesterday, a gushing behind-the-scenes featurette, today the official trailer in all its gaudy neon-lit glory \u2013 has held the internet rapt in semi-morbid fascination. At last, in two short but overwhelming minutes, the question of \u201chow the hell do you make a movie of Cats\u201d has been answered: by slathering an all-star cast that seems to have been assembled through a particularly manic game of Mad Libs (Judi Dench! Jennifer Hudson! Taylor Swift! Idris Elba! Jason DeRulo?) in a generous coat of much-vaunted \u201cdigital fur technology\u201d and building extravagantly outsize sets on which they leap and bound and perform thoroughly humanoid choreography. They\u2019re people! But they\u2019re also cats! So the cast member James Corden muses in wonderment in the making-of blurb \u2013 he believes, but will we? If the reaction to the trailer so far is anything to go by, the jury is not so much out as agog: in these difficult, polarised times, the internet appears to have miraculously united in a chorus of \u201cwhat the hell was that?\u201d Returning to the expensive mode of bombast that saw him make a smash hit out of another slow-to-the-screen musical, Les Miserables, Hooper appears to have fashioned the shonkily home-sewn aesthetic of the stage show into a lurid, gleamingly synthetic fantasia of distorted Victorian streetscapes and Metropolis-like milk bars. Yet even the Blade-Runner-meets-Cath-Kidston production design recedes into the background when set against the cats themselves, an ensemble of famous faces eerily superimposed onto lithe hybrid physiques: distinctly human facial features crowned by jaunty cat ears, dancing human limbs and pert derri\u00e8res disconcertingly giving way to long, snaking tails.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of police will be on the streets in French cities for the Algeria-Senegal football final of the Africa Cup of Nations on Friday night after more than 200 people were arrested when Algeria fans celebrated their semi-final win on Sunday. France, which was a colonial power in Algeria for more than 130 years, has a large number of dual nationality French-Algerians. More than half of the Algerian football team are players who were born, raised or trained in France. When, on Sunday, Algeria reached the final of the tournament \u2013 which is being held in Egypt \u2013 large crowds gathered for celebrations in the streets of cities such as Marseille and Paris. Cars drove around central Paris beeping, with people hanging from windows waving Algerian flags, and crowds gathered on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to cheer. But a minority of people were stopped by police after smashing windows or attempting to break into shops. Riot police fired teargas to disperse crowds around the Champs-Elys\u00e9es and 169 people were arrested in Paris. In total, 282 arrests were made across France after the semi-final, most for refusing to comply with police orders, throwing projectiles or endangering life. In Marseille, groups of celebrating Algerian fans had headed towards the Old Port on Sunday evening just after Bastille Day fireworks had finished, but police held them back. There were skirmishes between police and youths and a number of arrests for throwing projectiles. In Lyon, police said there had been clashes with security forces and a number of cars set alight on the outskirts of the city. It is common for hundreds of arrests to be made after important football celebrations in France. A year ago, when France won the World Cup, a large store was smashed and looted on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Police fired teargas and water cannon and 292 arrests were made across the country overnight. But Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration, far-right National Rally argued that the Africa Cup of Nations celebrations showed France\u2019s failure to integrate people with Algerian roots. Le Pen\u2019s party had asked police to close off the Champs-Elys\u00e9es during an earlier Algeria match last week, saying in a statement: \u201cFar from being demonstrations of joy by simple football fans, as commentators describe them, this is about real demonstrations of force and the aim is to ostensibly show a massive presence and a rejection of France.\u201d One member of Le Pen\u2019s party had suggested there should be a public order ban on waving the Algerian flag. Police in Paris have refused to close the Champs-Elys\u00e9es for the final on Friday and said the 2,500 officers stationed in the area were sufficient. The Paris police chief told Le Parisien he had \u201cno problem with people coming to show their joy on the world\u2019s most beautiful avenue\u201d provided there was no damage or destruction. Robert M\u00e9nard, the far-right mayor of B\u00e9ziers, said the fans celebrating Algeria\u2019s win were French \u201con paper\u201d only. But others said football should bring people together, not divide them. Riyad Mahrez, the Manchester City midfielder whose injury-time free kick sent a victorious Algeria into the final on Sunday, replied to Le Pen\u2019s party on Twitter. When Julien Odoul, a local National Rally politician in Burgundy, suggested France should support Nigeria against Algeria in the semi-final to \u201cavoid violence and pillaging, and a sea of Algerian flags\u201d, Mahrez replied that football was greater than hatred.",

Five minutes into the first episode, and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s underselling it.</p> <p>The show begins with a trio of \u201cferal nuns\u201d (as it was <a href=\"https://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Foxtel-Press-Releases/Foxtel-s-New-Drama-Lambs-of-God/td-p/241212\">apparently phrased</a> when pitched to Foxtel) meeting a priest, knocking him unconscious, shaving him down, binding his legs and holding him captive in their remote island convent.</p> <p>By comparison, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s dalliance with the priest on Fleabag seems positively chaste.</p> <p>The nuns are played by Davis, Ann Dowd (AKA Aunt Lydia from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) and Jessica Barden (from the Netflix hit The End of the F***ing World). Sam Reid features as the \u201cunspiritual\u201d Father Ignatius, who intrudes on this lonely sisterhood with a plot to sell their land for a profit. The elder sisters suss out his intentions early, hence the kidnapping, though Barden\u2019s young Sister Carla, having not stepped off the island before, succumbs to his wiles. During the four-episode miniseries, he becomes her plaything, especially the part of him that Sister Carla nicknames \u201cbaby Moses\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/18/shaun-micallef-is-mad-as-hell-after-abc-airs-wrong-episode-of-current-affairs-tv-show\">Shaun Micallef is Mad as Hell after ABC airs wrong episode of current affairs TV show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This current trend of illicit lustfulness towards the clergy (consider, too, The Young Pope featuring the regularly shirtless Jude Law) may seem like a weird cultural overcorrection given recent, awful, real events, but it\u2019s a familiar Australian trope, popularised back in the 80s and 90s through shows like The Thorn Birds<em> </em>and Brides of Christ.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0edc1742ab194cb5088e756ef9cec321a69b0360\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0edc1742ab194cb5088e756ef9cec321a69b0360/0_0_2362_3543/667.jpg\" alt=\"Essie Davis as a nun\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Essie Davis: \u2018If I\u2019m really scared of playing something, it really excites me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Rogers/Foxtel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet Davis, who plays the curt Sister Iphigenia, doesn\u2019t want you thinking this adaptation of Marele Day\u2019s 1998 novel goes soft on men of the cloth.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Roman Catholic Church is currently in such a broken place,\u201d she says. \u201cThis [show] will actually be quite uplifting for those who have had faith, and can see the hypocrisy, but still find spiritualism within it.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s referring to the \u201csometimes pagan\u201d<strong> </strong>practice of the nuns in the show, which involves a belief that the Sisters who died before them have been reincarnated as the lambs for which they now care.</p> <p>\u201cThese women are connected to the earth and to the spirituality of faith that is so profoundly honest, and not this politicised, male-dominated reorganising of the Bible and the Roman Catholic religion as a patriarchy.

Here, she is transformed, with severe cropped hair and hushed, clipped speaking voice.

      "bodyText": "\u201cNot at all tame\u201d is how Essie Davis describes her wild new Australian drama series, Lambs of God. Five minutes into the first episode, and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s underselling it. The show begins with a trio of \u201cferal nuns\u201d (as it was apparently phrased when pitched to Foxtel) meeting a priest, knocking him unconscious, shaving him down, binding his legs and holding him captive in their remote island convent. By comparison, Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s dalliance with the priest on Fleabag seems positively chaste. The nuns are played by Davis, Ann Dowd (AKA Aunt Lydia from The Handmaid\u2019s Tale) and Jessica Barden (from the Netflix hit The End of the F***ing World). Sam Reid features as the \u201cunspiritual\u201d Father Ignatius, who intrudes on this lonely sisterhood with a plot to sell their land for a profit. The elder sisters suss out his intentions early, hence the kidnapping, though Barden\u2019s young Sister Carla, having not stepped off the island before, succumbs to his wiles. During the four-episode miniseries, he becomes her plaything, especially the part of him that Sister Carla nicknames \u201cbaby Moses\u201d. This current trend of illicit lustfulness towards the clergy (consider, too, The Young Pope featuring the regularly shirtless Jude Law) may seem like a weird cultural overcorrection given recent, awful, real events, but it\u2019s a familiar Australian trope, popularised back in the 80s and 90s through shows like The Thorn Birds and Brides of Christ. Yet Davis, who plays the curt Sister Iphigenia, doesn\u2019t want you thinking this adaptation of Marele Day\u2019s 1998 novel goes soft on men of the cloth. \u201cI think the Roman Catholic Church is currently in such a broken place,\u201d she says. \u201cThis [show] will actually be quite uplifting for those who have had faith, and can see the hypocrisy, but still find spiritualism within it.\u201d She\u2019s referring to the \u201csometimes pagan\u201d practice of the nuns in the show, which involves a belief that the Sisters who died before them have been reincarnated as the lambs for which they now care. \u201cThese women are connected to the earth and to the spirituality of faith that is so profoundly honest, and not this politicised, male-dominated reorganising of the Bible and the Roman Catholic religion as a patriarchy. It may not feel like a \u2018correct\u2019 law-abiding Roman Catholic kind-of sisterhood, but it is very beautiful,\u201d she says. Davis calls Lambs of God \u2013 adapted by Sarah Lambert and helmed by Ali\u2019s Wedding filmmaker Jeffrey Walker \u2013 \u201ca war between the feminine and the masculine and [a stand] for womankind.\u201d Not to mention: \u201can escapist tale, and a fairytale, and a thriller, and a comedy.\u201d As Iphigenia, Davis is far from the fineries of Phryne Fisher, the chic and quick-witted flapper sleuth she inhabits in Miss Fisher\u2019s Murder Mysteries. Here, she is transformed, with severe cropped hair and hushed, clipped speaking voice. When she\u2019s introduced to Father Ignatius, her face is covered in animal blood; at times, her eyes become cloudy as she\u2019s overcome by second sight. \u201cI do find that if I\u2019m really scared of playing something, it really excites me at the same time as I\u2019m super worried that I\u2019m just gonna fail big time; [that] I\u2019m gonna be covered in omelette,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt was a great challenge and very complicated all the way through. And each of us four actors really held each other\u2019s hands, as if we were doing some kind of skydive routine, trying to pull our forces outwards against the force of gravity and create something marvellous to look at.\u201d As one of Australia\u2019s most versatile and daredevilish actors (see her go for broke in the brilliant horror allegory, The Babadook), she\u2019s glad to have avoided becoming typecast throughout her career by always \u201ctrying very hard to tread new ground\u201d. \u201cThat sort of helps me live a quite lovely life with a great deal of anonymity in it as well, because I feel like I\u2019m not recognised as a particular group of characters,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t expect to revive Sister Iphigenia, insisting Lambs of God is not going to be extended, in the style of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, beyond the parameters of its book adaptation. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone needs to revisit these characters,\u201d she says. \u201cThey face their own stories, and when they do, they find a sense of completion. And I think it is a complete story.\u201d \u2022 Lambs of God is showing on Foxtel\u2019s Showcase from 8.30pm Sunday 21 July",

In September 2001, a fire at a building in the Kabukicho entertainment district of central Tokyo killed 44.

Everyone from Anime fans to prime minister Shinzo Abe expressed anger, prayed and mourned the Kyoto victims on social media and a crowdfunding appeal set up to support the company and victims \u2013 who remain unidentified \u2013 has also gathered more than $1m in pledges. The suspect, named by police as Shinji Aoba, did not work for the studio but shouted that he had been plagiarised and appeared to have planned the attack, Japanese media reports said on Friday. A woman who saw the suspect being detained told reporters he \u201cseemed to be discontented, he seemed to get angry, shouting something about how he had been plagiarised\u201d. Survivors said he was screaming \u201cyou die!\u201d as he sprayed what emergency services officials called an unidentified liquid accelerant. They said some of the survivors were splashed with the liquid. The suspect was injured in the attack and is being treated in hospital. NHK footage also showed sharp knives police had collected from the scene, though it was not clear if they belonged to the attacker. Earlier, Hideaki Hatta, the chief executive of Kyoto Animation, said the company had recently received emails containing death threats, though it was unclear whether they related to Thursday\u2019s attack. \u201cThey were addressed to our office and sales department and told us to die,\u201d he said. \u201cI am heartbroken. It is unbearable that the people who helped carry Japan\u2019s animation industry were hurt and lost their lives in this way.\u201d The fire appeared to have been set near the front door with some kind of flammable liquid, police said, forcing people to scramble up the stairs to the roof. Of the 34 bodies found by firefighters, 20 were on the third floor and some on the stairs to the roof, where they had apparently collapsed, Kyoto fire official Kazuhiro Hayashi said. Two were found dead on the first floor, 11 others on the second floor, he said. The building has a spiral staircase that might have allowed flames and smoke to rise quickly to the top floor, broadcaster NHK noted. Yuji Hasemi, a fire expert at Waseda University, told NHK that paper drawings and other documents in the studio also might have contributed to the fire\u2019s rapid spread. The suspected arsonist started the fire in Japan\u2019s ancient capital on Thursday morning when about 70 people had gathered for their day\u2019s work at the three-storey building. \u201cThere was an explosion, then I heard people shouting, some asking for help,\u201d a witness told TBS TV. \u201cBlack smoke was rising from windows on upper floors. Then there was a man struggling to crawl out of the window.\u201d Most of the victims were employees of Kyoto Animation, which does work on movies and TV productions but is best known for its mega-hit stories featuring high school girls. The tales are so popular that fans make pilgrimages to some of the places depicted. Kyoto Animation, better known as KyoAni, was founded in 1981 as an animation and comic book production studio, and its hits include Lucky Star in 2008, K-On! in 2011 and Haruhi Suzumiya in 2009. The company does not have a major presence outside Japan, though it was hired to do secondary animation work on a 1998 Pokemon feature that appeared in US cinemas and a Winnie the Pooh video. Violent crime is rare in Japan, though it is not unknown. In July 2016, a mass stabbing at a care home by a former employee killed 16 and injured more. In September 2001, a fire at a building in the Kabukicho entertainment district of central Tokyo killed 44. Arson was suspected, but nobody was ever charged, meaning the Kyoto Animation attack is the worst confirmed mass murder in Japan\u2019s post-war history.",

      "bodyText": "The good and the great of Melbourne packed in to the town hall on Thursday evening to hear the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, speak on the topic of why good government matters. Since the tragic Christchurch mosque massacre, Ardern has come to be seen not just as one of the world\u2019s youngest leaders of a nation, but also as one of the world\u2019s great leaders. As Ardern\u2019s oration displayed her mastery of her brief, more than one of the 2,000 people in the main hall was left wondering how Australia might fare under the prime ministership of Jacinda Ardern. While this may be dismissed as a fantasy in 2019, it was not always thus. In fact, when Melbourne Town Hall first opened in 1870 the inclusion of New Zealand as part of the push to create a new nation of Australia was very much a live debate. Writing in the 1870s, the great Australian novelist and journalist Marcus Clarke wrote of the Australasian Empire as a continent cut in half by a line through the centre. Above the line would be the colonies of Queensland, New Guinea and the Malaccas, while beneath the line was a nation made up of the southern colonies, including Victoria, New South Wales and New Zealand. In Clarke\u2019s idealised democratic southern republic, the intellectual capital would be in Victoria, the fashionable and luxurious capital on the shore of Sydney harbour, while the governing capital would be in New Zealand. Obviously Clarke\u2019s contribution to how Australasia should govern itself did not prevail when the constitutions of Australia and New Zealand were drafted in the 1890s. And while his novel For the Term of His Natural Life remains the great Australian novel of the 19th century, Clarke\u2019s contribution on the governing system of Australia and New Zealand has been long forgotten. But sitting at the town hall on Thursday evening, I did wonder how things might be different if this radical idea had prevailed. To begin with, Jacinda Ardern could be the prime minister of southern Australasia, leading the peoples of Victoria, NSW and New Zealand. Meanwhile, Scott Morrison could be the PM of Queensland and beyond. If only it was that simple. The complex truth is that New Zealand has a long history of outstanding policy innovation and political leadership that transcends a single prime minister. The recent conservative National party PM, John Key, provided exceptional leadership for New Zealand. For eight years he guided his country through the tribulations of the GFC and two major earthquakes while also implementing major tax policy reform and introducing an emissions trading scheme. In the same period, Australia suffered from policy paralysis and the internecine party wars. Key once roasted Australia\u2019s revolving door of prime minsters, recounting: \u201cI used to say, \u2018mate, I don\u2019t really mind who turns up, just wear a name badge so I know who it is\u2019.\u201d New Zealand has long been the social laboratory for progressive policy reform; it led the world into the 20th century with the introduction of female voting and the old-age pension. In more recent times it seems that for every policy success achieved by New Zealand, Australia has suffered an equal and opposite failure. The last major contested policy reform that has been maintained in Australia is the introduction of the GST in 2000, almost 20 years ago. New Zealand, on the other hand, has lifted the GST twice as part of a major \u201ctax switch\u201d that slashed income tax rates, lifted superannuation and welfare payments, increased property tax but cut the company tax rate. In 2008, NZ introduced a carbon price and emissions trading scheme. Like most schemes it has been subject to revision, but the critical architecture of the ETS remains in place. Meanwhile, Australia does not have a national energy policy. On the social policy front, a New Zealand legalised same sex-marriage in 2013 while Australia was the last English-speaking country in the world to introduce marriage equality. Not surprisingly, there is now a huge gap between how Australians and New Zealanders think about government. The most recent Australian Election Study and New Zealand Election Study asked voters in the two countries whether voting \u201cmatters\u201d, and whether it \u201cmakes any difference to what happens\u201d. Of the Kiwi respondents, 81% of the Kiwi respondents who expressed a view said voting matters. The figure in the Australian survey was just 58%. Australians who care about the quality of government and policy making need to study New Zealand closely. The differences between the two countries\u2019 governing systems suggest some major reform options for Australia. Some differences appear to make it easier to get things done on the other side of the ditch: New Zealand has a unitary, rather than federal, system of government. The New Zealand parliament also does not have an upper house. On the other hand, New Zealand has adopted a proportional representation voting system which makes it very hard for one party to win a majority in its own right and requires coalition-building and negotiations. Beyond the mechanics of how laws are made, there are also differences in geography and culture that are perhaps even more important. Australia has the complication of vast distances that create special pressures on government \u2013 this suggests the need for a federal system of government that defers considerable power to the local level. Instead Australia has ended up with a federal system that focuses a lot of power in the centre. Finally, New Zealand is a plucky nation with a progressive political culture. While Australia has a similar political culture in some places, think Victoria or South Australia, this is kept in check by more conservative sates like Queensland. Ultimately, Australia\u2019s future wellbeing depends on its political system rediscovering its reform mojo. Hopefully we can learn a lesson or two from New Zealand.

      "bodyText": "CNN has announced the lineup for the next 2020 Democratic debate, which will take place in Detroit, Michigan on 30 July and 31 July. Trump announced that he intends to nominate Eugene Scalia (son of late supreme court justice Antonin Scalia) to be the next labor secretary. Scalia would replace Alexander Acosta, who resigned following criticism for overseeing a lenient plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. Trump has said he disagrees with the \u201csend her back\u201d chants against representative Ilhan Omar at his rally in North Carolina on Wednesday; the president sought to distance himself from the chants, which were widely condemned as racist, even though he allowed them to proceed during the rally itself. Ilhan Omar received a warm welcome back in her home state Minnesota. She is not backing down, telling reporters she thinks Trump is a \u201cfascist\u201d and dismissing the suggestion by some Republicans that she should scale back her criticism; Omar said the US is supposed to be a country that allows \u201cdemocratic debate and dissent\u201d. Top Democrats have meanwhile voiced concern over Omar\u2019s safety, calling for enhanced security in the wake of Trump\u2019s attacks; Omar has acknowledged receiving death threats stemming from the president\u2019s tweets and comments targeting her. Donald Trump and aides were directly involved in discussions surrounding an illegal hush-money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the 2016 campaign, according to unsealed FBI documents. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler has asked Trump aide Hope Hicks explain inconsistencies in her testimonies. Trump said a US naval ship shot down and \u201cdestroyed\u201d an Iranian drone near the Strait of Hormuz; the president said the US took defensive measures after the Iranians ignored multiple commands to stand down. CNN drew names from a box on live TV to decide the lineup for the next 2020 Democratic debate to be held at the end of the month in Detroit, Michigan. Here\u2019s the breakdown: Day 1, July 30 South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg Former Texas representative Beto O\u2019Rourke Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar Author Marianne Williamson Former Maryland representative John Delaney Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper Ohio representative Tim Ryan Montana governor Steve Bullock Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren Vermont senator Bernie Sanders Day 2 Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro Businessman Andrew Yang New Jersey senator Cory Booker Washington governor Jay Inslee New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard Colorado senator Michael Bennet New York mayor Bill de Blasio Former vice-president Joe Biden California senator Kamala Harris And it\u2019s official \u2014 Trump intends to nominate Eugene Scalia for labor secretary. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler is requesting that Trump\u2019s former press secretary Hope Hicks come back and explain why her previous testimony regarding a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels is inconsistent with new evidence from the FBI. In the letter, Nadler writes: \u201cAs I reminded you at the outset of your interview, anything other than complete candor can have serious consequences.\u201d Listing out the instances in which Hicks\u2019 testimony contradicts information in court filings that were unsealed today, Nadler concludes, \u201cI would like to give you an opportunity to clarify your testimony on a voluntary basis.\u201d It\u2019s looking like Trump will nominate Eugene Scalia, son of the late Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, for Labor secretary. Politico first reported that sources familiar with the president\u2019s plans confirmed that Scalia was a top choice to replace Alexander Acosta, who resigned following criticism for overseeing a lenient plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. Scalia, who is a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, represented Wal-mart in a 2006 case challenging a Maryland law that would have required the company to spend more on its employees\u2019 healthcare. A source close to Scalia confirmed the news to NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg. The Mexican ambassador to Washington said that Mexico is not ready to sign a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement. From Reuters: Mexico has told the United States time and again it is not ready to ink a deal forcing asylum seekers heading to the U.S. to first pursue safe haven in a Mexico, the Mexican ambassador to Washington said on Thursday, ahead of a Monday deadline. Martha Barcena rejected the so-called \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement days before the clock runs out on a deal struck with U.S. President Donald Trump in June. Under that commitment, Mexico averted punitive tariffs by promising to stem the flow of illegal migrants from Central America by July 22. If it failed, Latin America\u2019s second largest economy would have to accept safe-third-country status. \u201cWe have said once and again that we are not ready to sign\u201d any such agreement, Barcena said at an event in Washington, D.C. Her comments come days before Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard is slated to meet his U.S. counterpart Mike Pompeo in Mexico City this weekend to discuss migration and trade. Three children, who Border Patrol reportedly held at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport for 12 hours, have finally been released to their mother. WBEZ reported that activists, advocates and lawyers gathered earlier today at the airport, demanding the children\u2019s release. The children flew back from Mexico early this morning with a cousin who had a valid visitor visa, the activists say. The girls\u2019 cousin is being detained, too. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers deemed the cousin \u201cinadmissible,\u201d according to a statement issued by a department spokesperson. The statement didn\u2019t offer further details about the cousin\u2019s status. \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers have attempted numerous times today to reach family members to pick up the children. As of 2 pm [Central time] CBP Officers are still awaiting a legal guardian to arrive and pick the children up,\u201d the statement read. Activists say that\u2019s a trap and the parents are afraid of being detained and placed in deportation proceedings. \u201cThis is yet another example of the abusive practices and disregard of the law,\u201d said Mony Ruiz-Velasco, executive director of PASO West Suburban Action Project. \u201cThey have three U.S. citizen young girls detained, causing trauma and harm to this family and our communities.\u201d Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois, also flew in from DC. After releasing the children, Border Patrol tweeted: The Democratic chairman of the House homeland security committee called for an emergency meeting with the Capitol police board to address what he said are \u201cheightened threats\u201d to the four lawmakers known as the \u201cSquad\u201d. Reuters reports: Representative Bennie Thompson, in a letter to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger who heads the police board, cited \u201cheightened threats\u201d to four House Democrats who have come under attack by Trump, as well as other members of Congress. \u201cLast night at a campaign rally, the president once again used inflammatory rhetoric about the four congresswomen,\u201d Thompson wrote in urging the meeting. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota received a warm welcome upon arriving in the Twin Cities, to supporters cheering, \u201cWelcome home Ilhan.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to continue allowing the use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that studies have associated with brain damage in children. From The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin: The US government has rejected a proposed ban on a toxic pesticide linked to brain damage in children, dismissing a growing body of research on the health hazards of a widely used agricultural chemical. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced in a ruling Thursday that it supported farmers\u2019 continued use of chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that growers have long sprayed on almonds, citrus, cotton, grapes, walnuts and other major crops in America. The decision, outlined in a response to a petition from environmental and public health groups, said \u201ccritical questions remained regarding the significance of the data\u201d on neurological impacts on children. The Trump administration\u2019s endorsement of the pesticide comes years after the EPA under Obama moved to restrict use of the chemical, as scientists raised alarms. Trump\u2019s EPA denied the conclusions of the agency\u2019s own experts, and earlier this year, California defied the White House and announced its own state-level ban on the chemical. Trump accepted an American flag that flew on D-day, donated by a Dutch businessman, while meeting with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte. The AP reports: The Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History says a hole right through the middle of the tattered flag\u2019s field of stars is believed to have come from a German machine gun bullet. Meanwhile, representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says she\u2019s getting back to business. She and other lawmakers questioned the Department of Homeland Security acting secretary Kevin McAleenan about conditions at the US-Mexico border. She also questioned McAleenan about a private Facebook group created by current and former border patrol agents in which they shared racist posts. Ocasio-Cortez herself was reportedly depicted in an obscene manipulated image shared in the group, which McAleenan said is being investigated. Jeffrey Epstein will remain behind bars while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. In his ruling, the US district judge Richard Berman noted that Epstein would be \u201ca danger to others and the community by clear and convincing evidence\u201d were he to be released on bail. Maanvi Singh here, taking over the liveblog. The supreme court justice Elena Kagan spoke at Georgetown University about the passing of justice John Paul Stevens. She said he was \u201csharp as a tack\u201d until the day he died, at age 99. She also shared her much anticipated thoughts on another important topic... the new Spiderman film. OK folks, I\u2019m getting ready to pass the baton on to my colleague Maanvi Singh on the West Coast. But before I go, allow me to recap where things stand: Donald Trump has said he disagrees with the \u201csend her back\u201d chants against representative Ilhan Omar at his rally in North Carolina on Wednesday; the president sought to distance himself from the chants, which were widely condemned as racist, even though he allowed them to proceed during the rally itself. Ilhan Omar is not backing down, telling reporters she thinks Trump is a \u201cfascist\u201d and dismissing the suggestion by some Republicans that she should scale back her criticism; Omar said the US is supposed to be a country that allows \u201cdemocratic debate and dissent\u201d. Top Democrats have meanwhile voiced concern over Omar\u2019s safety, calling for enhanced security in the wake of Trump\u2019s attacks; Omar has acknowledged receiving death threats stemming from the president\u2019s tweets and comments targeting her. Donald Trump was involved in repeated discussions surrounding an illegal hush-money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the 2016 campaign, according to FBI documents unsealed on Thursday; Trump and his former communications director, Hope Hicks, both discussed the issue with the president\u2019s former attorney, Michael Cohen. Donald Trump said a US naval ship shot down and \u201cdestroyed\u201d an Iranian drone near the Strait of Hormuz; the president said the US took defensive measures after the Iranians ignored multiple commands to stand down. As always, the news never stops... so stay tuned for more updates throughout the evening! Ivanka Trump expressed her displeasure with the \u201csend her back\u201d chants against Ilhan Omar behind closed doors because of course she did. Citing officials at the White House, the Wall Street Journal reported that the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser conveyed her misgivings about the episode to Donald Trump on Thursday morning. Ivanka Trump\u2019s silence on Trump\u2019s attacks against four congresswomen of color, as well as the conditions at migrant detention facilities, has been a subject of scrutiny. At times, she has publicly disagreed with her father on matters of policy. At the same time, Ivanka Trump has come under immense criticism for her role in the administration and been branded as \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the president\u2019s conduct. The 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has said he was out to dinner with representative Ilhan Omar and others when reports of the \u201csend her back\u201d chants at Donald Trump\u2019s rally came through. In an email to supporters, Sanders said Omar was \u201cunfazed\u201d. The Vermont senator has condemned Trump\u2019s attacks against Omar. Alas, the video of Ted Cruz accidentally swallowing a spider or insect of some sort on live TV was fake. My apologies! I leave you instead with this clip of Cruz imitating Winston Churchill: Donald Trump and one of his top aides were directly involved in discussions that led to an illegal hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign, the FBI has said. A court filing unsealed on Thursday stated that Trump and his former communications director, Hope Hicks, spoke on several occasions with the president\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, about the payment. Cohen paid Daniels, an adult film actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 during the 2016 campaign to prevent her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen is currently serving a three-year prison sentence for financial crimes and lying to Congress. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine has more here on what the FBI documents revealed about Trump\u2019s involvement. It marks the first time US authorities have referred to Trump by name, and also raises the possibility that Hicks lied to the FBI: Hicks told an agent in an interview that \u2018she did not learn about the allegations made by Clifford until early November 2016\u2019, the new filings said. Hicks, who is now a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corporation, has denied wrongdoing.\u201d A US navy vessel shot down and \u201cimmediately destroyed\u201d an Iranian drone near the Strait of Hormuz, Donald Trump announced on Thursday. \u201cThis is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters,\u201d Trump said while speaking at an unrelated event at the White House. \u201cThe United States reserves the right to defend our personnel, facilities, and interests.\u201d Trump said the Iranians ignored multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the USS Boxer and its crew. The president also called on other countries \u201cto protect their ships as they go through the Strait\u201d and to work with the US in the future. Trump\u2019s remarks come amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran. Last month, Iran\u2019s revolutionary guard shot down a US military surveillance drone that they said had violated Iranian airspace. The action prompted Trump to tweet that Iran had \u201cmade a very big mistake\u201d. \u201cThe Squad\u201d has a fan in UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet. According to Reuters, Bachelet praised the four congresswomen of color and targets of Donald Trump as \u201cfantastic\u201d. \u201cI believe that those four women are fantastic,\u201d Bachelet said at Geneva\u2019s Graduate Institute. \u201cI see bright women who dare to say what they think.\u201d Bachelet declined to respond when asked if Trump was racist. But former South African constitutional judge Albie Sachs, who spoke alongside her, took the microphone and said: \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d More from Reuters: Bachelet said she would not use any particular adjective, but said people in a democracy should ensure respect for diversity, for people who think differently and for people of a different color. \u201cIt is not good for leaders, global leaders, (to use) hate speech, saying things that are bad examples or bad models, because it permits and gives license to many others to be xenophobic, to be anti-Islamic, anti-Semitic, anti-everything, anti-foreign,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the dangers in the world today.\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has weighed in on Donald Trump\u2019s rally and the president\u2019s attacks on her colleague and fellow \u2018Squad\u2019 member, Representative Ilhan Omar: The president put millions of Americans in danger last night. His rhetoric is endangering lots of people. This is not just about threats to individual members of Congress, but it is about creating a volatile environment in this country through violent rhetoric that puts anyone, like Ilhan, anyone who believes in the rights of all people, in danger. And I think that he has a responsibility for that environment.\u201d Trump also took aim at Ocasio-Cortez during his rally in North Carolina on Wednesday. In addition to dismissing her criticisms of the conditions at migrant detention facilities, Trump mocked Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s name. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to go with three different names. We will call her Cortez,\u201d he said. Florida senator Marco Rubio is out with a video addressing the outrage over the attacks against Representative Ilhan Omar, and he is ... outraged over the outrage. Rubio, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, tweeted that the \u201csend her back\u201d chants from Donald Trump\u2019s rally on Wednesday was \u201cgrotesque\u201d. He then proceeded to take aim at \u201cleftwing politicians\u201d and the media for what he said were double standards in allegations of racism and bias, where only Republicans are labeled as white nationalists. \u201cThe hypocrisy, the self-righteousness, outrages people, too,\u201d Rubio said. He also noted that while Trump\u2019s tweet attacking the four congresswomen of color -- aka \u201cThe Squad\u201d -- was wrong, there wasn\u2019t enough attention being paid to the attacks the quartet of Democrats levy against their own opponents. \u201cNo one should question that they are fully as American as we or anybody else, but they\u2019re also political bullies,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey go around attacking people \u2026 but when you hit them back, it\u2019s because they\u2019re women of color.\u201d There was, in fact, ample coverage of the feud between The Squad and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, stemming from the very public way in which the freshmen lawmakers aired their grievances with other House Democrats over matters of policy. Things got particularly ugly when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York suggested Pelosi was explicitly \u201csingling out of newly elected women of color\u201d. It was at the height of that tension that Trump decided to inject himself into the conversation, because he happened to be tweeting on Sunday and couldn\u2019t help but sit this one out. The rest -- as in, the part where the president said these four congresswomen of color, all American citizens, should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they \u201ccame from\u201d -- is history. Only a handful of Republicans spoke out against Trump\u2019s tweet, which by Wednesday looked as though it was fading from the conversation. But the president, who openly told reporters he was \u2018enjoying\u2019 the fight, decided to escalate matters by bringing up \u201cThe Squad\u201d at his campaign rally in North Carolina later that evening. It\u2019s worth recalling that Rubio, during his own bid for president in 2016, was arguably Trump\u2019s most visceral critic. I covered his campaign for the Guardian, and on the day Rubio dropped out of the race he told me Trump was an \u201cembarrassment\u201d and that Republicans would be banished to \u201cthe wilderness\u201d in 2016 and beyond if he was their nominee. Rubio eventually backed Trump\u2019s campaign and, despite their occasional disagreements, has emerged as one of the president\u2019s most prominent supporters. Representative Ilhan Omar on Thursday responded to Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of her and chants of \u201csend her back\u201d targeting her at his rally by reiterating her belief that the president is \u201cracist\u201d. \u201cWe have said this president is racist. We have condemned his racist remarks,\u201d Omar told reporters on Capitol Hill, while adding of Trump: \u201cI believe he is fascist.\u201d Omar, a congresswoman from Minnesota, also hit back at South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham for suggesting the \u201csend her back\u201d chants would not have occurred had she not criticized the president. Earlier on Thursday, Graham said the chants were not racist, telling reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think a Somali refugee embracing Trump would be asked to go back.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re racist, you want everybody to go back because they are black or Muslim. That\u2019s not what this is about,\u201d Graham added. Omar reacted to Graham\u2019s comments with disbelief, saying the Republican senator was effectively arguing that only Somali refugees who wore pro-Trump \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 were welcome in the US. \u201cIf I was wearing a MAGA hat, if there was a Somali person wearing a MAGA hat, they would not be deported, but because I criticize the president I should be deported,\u201d Omar said, paraphrasing Graham\u2019s argument. \u201cI want to remind people that this is what this president and his supporters have turned our country [into],\u201d Omar said, pointing out the US was \u201csupposed to be a country where we allow democratic debate and dissent to take place\u201d. \u201cThis is not about me. This is about us fighting for what our country truly should be and deserves to be.\u201d President asks Rohingya man, \u201cwhere\u2019s that?\u201d At an event at the White House yesterday, Donald Trump was told by a Rohingya muslim refugee who had fled persecution in Myanmar to a regional refugee camp that his people were hoping to \u201cgo back home as quickly as possible\u201d. He asked the president what was the United States\u2019s \u201cplan for that?\u201d Trump paused, then said: \u201cAnd where is that exactly?\u201d Someone standing next to the president\u2019s chair in the Oval Office leaned in and said, presumably referring to the refugee camp, the name of which was not clearly audible on the little video clip that emerged on Twitter today: \u201cRight next to Burma.\u201d Trump replied in the direction of the refugee: \u201cThank you, I appreciate it.\u201d Then without missing a beat, he moved on to the next person. It\u2019s tough to watch. Donald Trump a few moment ago attempted to disavow the racist chanting that broke out at his rally last night in North Carolina - despite the fact that the whole storm started from his racist tweets on Sunday. Asked in the Oval Office just now by White House pool reporters why he did not stop the chants last night of \u201csend her back\u201d when he mentioned Ilhan Omar, he said: \u201cI think I did - I started speaking very quickly.\u201dHe also added: \u201cI was not happy with it - I disagree with it.\u201d It\u2019s already been a very long week in politics in respect of race relations and immigration policy, but it was only on Sunday (followed by Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) that the president attacked Minnesota Democratic representative Omar and her closest allies in Congress by wheeling out the most obvious racist tropes, urging them to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\u201d. The House passed a bill along party lines to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, marking a victory for Democratic leaders who had struggled to unite their party on the issue. Even though raising the minimum wage has been a central plank of the Democratic platform for years, the party\u2019s centrist lawmakers expressed anxiety about more than doubling the current requirement of $7.25 an hour. Democratic leadership only convinced them to back the proposal by lengthening the phasing-in process to six years, a concession that irked progressive lawmakers. Reality check: this bill is headed nowhere. The Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to bring it up for a vote and even less likely to pass it. But Democratic leadership still hopes the bill\u2019s passage will give members of the caucus facing tough reelections something to tout back in their home districts. Reports coming in of arrests involving demonstrators opposing the Trump administration\u2019s policies relating to the US-Mexico border. Jesse Jackson defends White House correspondents The civil rights leader\u2019s tweet just now, criticizing Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Squad and calling for solidarity, also references women in the press. The two journalists whose images he included in his tweet are Yamiche Alcindor, White House correspondent for PBS, and April Ryan, the DC Bureau Chief at American Urban Radio Network. As an aside, Ryan is poised to moderate the 2020 presidential candidates\u2019 forum at the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) convention in Detroit next Wednesday, July 24. Last year, in a choice moment of ignorance and classic gas-lighting, Donald Trump, astonishingly, accused Alcindor of posing a \u201cracist question\u201d when she had asked the president whether his embrace of \u201cnationalism\u201d has been emboldening for the white-nationalist movement, the Daily Beast reported at the time. And February, 2017, is seared into the memories of correspondents attending a (seemingly long lost) daily official press briefing at the White House, and the millions watching on TV, for Trump\u2019s reaction when April Ryan asked the freshly-minted president if he was going to include the Congressional Black Caucus in conversations he will have about his \u201cinner city\u201d policies. Trump responded by repeatedly and blithely asking Ryan if she could set up a meeting with the caucus, members of which the president suggested could be \u201cfriends\u201d of hers. He finished the interaction by saying to Ryan: \u201cLet\u2019s go. Set up a meeting!\u201d After the press conference, Ryan said on Twitter: \u201cI am a journalist not a convener! But thank you for answering my questions.\u201d The caucus also tweeted a statement shortly after the conference: \u201cHi, @realDonaldTrump. We\u2019re the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad!\u201d A link to the letter was included. If you\u2019re trying to remember why July 24 rings a huge bell, by the way, it\u2019s coz it\u2019s MUELLER DAY. Former special counsel Robert Mueller is testifying on Capitol Hill that day. Donald Trump once again took to his favorite form of social media to slam Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, who is facing demands for his resignation after a string of leaked text messages showed him making misogynistic and homophobic comments. The outcry over the texts with his closest advisers has sparked protests in San Juan, as our correspondent Oliver Laughland reports. Trump tweeted that the governor is \u201cunder siege,\u201d but oddly he reserved most of his ire for San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who has been an outspoken critic of Rossell\u00f3. \u201cA lot of bad things are happening in Puerto Rico,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cThe Governor is under siege, the Mayor of San Juan is a despicable and incompetent person who I wouldn\u2019t trust under any circumstance, and the United States Congress foolishly gave 92 Billion Dollars for hurricane relief, much \u2026 of which was squandered away or wasted, never to be seen again.\u201d This is only the latest fight Trump has picked with Cruz, who he has previously criticized as \u201ccrazed\u201d and \u201cincompetent\u201d after she accused his administration of mishandling Hurricane Maria relief efforts. She has responded in kind by calling him \u201cunhinged.\u201d Demonstrators are reportedly on the way to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) headquarters in DC right now. A reporter on the spot has noted via Twitter that she\u2019s been told the HQ has gone into lockdown. This amid continued chaos on the US-Mexico border as the Trump administration tries to ban the seeking of asylum in the US via a third country (which the ACLU has said is a \u201cpatently unlawful\u201d attempt to block migrants\u2019 rights and has mounted a legal challenge). Protesters are marching from Capitol Hill, where Kevin McAleenan, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the federal umbrella for Ice, is testifying this morning. Read about the confusion being caused by the government\u2019s so-called Wait in Mexico policy even before the latest move to try to outlaw asylum applications via Mexico for those whose journeys to the US border originated beyond Mexico. Jesse Jackson expresses concern for Ilhan Omar safety The civil rights leader has added his voice to the expressions of concern coming from Democrats for the security of representative Ilhan Omar, while slamming racist attacks on her and her fellow core group of progressives in the House. Jesse Jackson tweeted a few minutes ago that the attacks are \u201clife-threatening\u201d and against Equal Employment Opportunity Commission workplace regulations. He added concern also for \u201cwomen in the press\u201d. Senior Washington Democrats are not only outraged at the racist attacks by the president on Ilhan Omar, with flames fanned by \u201csend her back\u201d chanting at Wednesday night\u2019s Trump rally, they are intensely worried for her safety. Party figures are now calling for authorities to evaluate security for Omar. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to me that her life is in imminent danger,\u201d said Bobby Rush, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cHe has threatened the safety of a member of Congress. That takes this to a whole different level,\u201d writes Politico this morning. The House\u2019s no 4 Democratic member weighed in. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that the president didn\u2019t stop the chant last night. But he started it. It\u2019s instilling fear, it\u2019s going to instill violence,\u201d said Ben Ray Lujan. Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein have once again downplayed his having an expired Austrian passport with his photo but listing a different name -- which has been key to prosecutors\u2019 argument against granting him bail. The Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office, which is prosecuting Epstein, previously said that a search of his home yielded this passport, which listed him as residing in Saudi Arabia; they contended this \u201cgives rise to the inference the defendant knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, foreign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.\u201d His lawyers, however, maintained that \u201cin any case, Epstein \u2013 an affluent member of the Jewish faith \u2013 acquired the passport in the 1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East travel,\u201d his lawyers previously argued. \u201cThe passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers, hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur,\u201d they also said in court papers. In new papers filed shortly before Epstein\u2019s bail hearing later this morning, his lawyers sought to further minimize its importance. \u201cEpstein was given the passport at issue by a friend. Some Jewish-Americans were informally advised at the time to carry identification bearing a non-Jewish name when traveling internationally in case of hijacking,\u201d they maintained. \u201cHe never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration or customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do not reflect Mr. Epstein\u2019s entries or exits.\u201d \u201cAs Mr. Epstein truthfully reported in his Pretrial Services interview, he is a life-long American citizen. He has no other citizenship or legal permanent residency,\u201d they also claimed. Another Democrat has come out in favor of impeaching Donald Trump. Representative Peter Welch, a congressman from Vermont, issued a statement on Thursday saying he had \u201ccome to the conclusion\u201d that the president should be impeached. \u201cI did not arrive at this conclusion lightly,\u201d Welch wrote. \u201cHowever, after 30 months in office, President Trump has established a clear pattern of willful disregard for our Constitution and its systems of checks and balances.\u201d \u201cHis presidency has wrought an unprecedented and unrelenting assault on the pillars and guardrails of our democracy, including the rule of law on which our country was founded.\u201d Welch did not specifically cite Trump\u2019s attacks on four congresswomen of color in his statement, but said the president had \u201cunleashed a torrent of attacks on fellow citizens on their race, gender, religion, and ethnic origin\u201d. The House of Representatives voted to table a resolution on Wednesday that would launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. The 332-to-95 vote proved that Democrats, who control the chamber, are far from ready to go that path. A growing number of Democrats have, however, called for launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Most have cited his repeated attempts to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has sought to stave off impeachment proceedings, telling Democrats the issue is politically divisive and would only help Trump in his reelection bid. One of the prevailing themes of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has been the transformation of the Republican Party under his watch. Despite their initial discomfort with Trump as the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer, Republicans have increasingly embraced the former reality TV star and largely adopted his anti-immigration platform as their own. And so when Trump went after four congresswomen of color in a series of racist tweets, Republicans were either silent or tepid in their criticism of the president. Some even defended Trump\u2019s tweets and echoed his attacks on the quartet of Democratic lawmakers, also known as \u201cThe Squad\u201d. It is therefore of little surprise that Republicans are not exactly coming out swinging in the wake of the \u201csend her back\u201d chants against Representative Ilhan Omar at Trump\u2019s rally in North Carolina on Wednesday. Instead, Republicans are doing what they\u2019ve mastered over the last two and a half years: condemning the sentiment -- but separating it from Trump, even if he is the one who has fueled it. \u201cIs the President a racist or not, I don\u2019t think he is,\u201d Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, said Thursday. In an interview with CSPAN\u2019s Washington Journal, Burchett suggested Trump\u2019s roots in New York were to blame for his language. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have chosen those words, they\u2019re hurtful,\u201d he added, before stating those offended by Trump\u2019s attacks should toughen up: \u201cYou know what, dadgummit we\u2019re in Congress, grow up, it\u2019s tough, life is tough \u2026 dadgummit just take it and go.\u201d As we noted earlier, both Anthony Scaramucci, Trump\u2019s short-lived White House communications director, and Representative Tom Emmer, a Republican from Minnesota, rejected the \u201csend her back\u201d chants but went on the insist Trump was not a racist. Representative Mark Walker, a member of House Republican leadership, said he \u201cstruggled\u201d with the anti-Omar chants. But he went on to echo Trump\u2019s claims that she was \u2018anti-American\u2019. \u201cHer history, words &amp; actions reveal her great disdain for both America &amp; Israel,\u201d Walker tweeted. \u201cThat should be our focus and not phrasing that\u2019s painful to our friends in the minority communities.\u201d In an interview with Fox Business Network, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was not specifically asked about the \u201csend her back\u201d chants. But when asked about Trump\u2019s singling out of \u201cThe Squad\u201d at his rally, McConnell said the president was \u201cright\u201d that the four congresswomen were pushing the US to the brink of socialism. \u201cWell, look, he\u2019s right about the squad wanting to turn us into a socialist country,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhat he should have added, however, is that it\u2019s a lot broader than just four of them.\u201d Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, criticized the tone on both sides, tweeting: \u201cI deeply disagree with the extreme left &amp; have been disgusted by their tone. I woke up today equally disgusted - chants like \u2018send her back\u2019 are ugly, wrong, &amp; would send chills down the spines of our Founding Fathers.\u201d Why it matters: The Republican reaction is not only informative in that it reinforces Trump\u2019s hold over the party, but also for what it enables. Republicans often urge the president to rein in his more incendiary attacks on minorities, even as they defend his motivations and quickly move on. Republicans insist there is a distinction between Trump\u2019s nationalism and the agenda of white nationalists, who they dismiss as on the fringes. Trump\u2019s rhetoric against immigrations and people of color meanwhile continues to intensify, and the nativism and xenophobia that Republicans claim is not a part of his messaging becomes more and more mainstream. It\u2019s effectively blaming the symptoms while ignoring the cause. 2020 Democratic candidates wasted no time backing Representative Ilhan Omar after the crowd at Donald Trump\u2019s rally on Wednesday erupted into chants of \u201csend her back\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s vile. It\u2019s cowardly. It\u2019s xenophobic,\u201d California senator Kamala Harris tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s racist. It defiles the office of the President. And I won\u2019t share it here. It\u2019s time to get Trump out of office and unite the country.\u201d Vermont senator Bernie Sanders also chimed in, tweeting: \u201cThe demagogue is doing what he knows best: Divide and conquer through hate. His attacks only make us stronger. #IStandWithIlhan\u201d Former vice president Joe Biden urged the president to stop, stating: \u201cOur children are listening.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve heard it before throughout our history, but it has no place in America in 2019,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Donald Trump is trying to divide us by race and gender. It\u2019s immoral.\u201d He went on to praise immigrants as an example of \u201cwhat makes America great\u201d, while adding: \u201cDonald Trump thinks that our nation\u2019s great diversity makes us weak \u2014 because he has no idea what makes us great.\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on Omar and three other congresswomen of color -- who collectively are known as \u201cThe Squad\u201d -- have served as a rallying cry for Democrats. The president originally tweeted the four women, all of whom are US citizens, should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they \u201ccame from\u201d. His nonetheless took his broadsides against Omar to another level while campaigning in North Carolina on Wednesday, which prompted the \u201csend her back\u201d chants from rally-goers. New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, another 2020 presidential contender, said Trump\u2019s focus on Omar was the latest example of his \u201ccontempt for women\u201d. \u201cWhether it\u2019s \u2018send her back\u2019 or \u2018lock her up,\u2019 \u2018there has to be some form of punishment\u2019 or \u2018grab her by the p***y\u2019\u2014the throughline is contempt for women and anyone who threatens this president\u2019s fragile ego,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should be afraid. We are his worst nightmare. And we will beat him.\u201d Representative Ilhan Omar remained unbowed after \u201csend her back\u201d chants broke out at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in North Carolina. \u201cI am where I belong, at the people\u2019s house and you\u2019re just gonna have to deal!\u201d Omar tweeted, alongside a photo of her presiding over the House chamber. Omar, who arrived in the US as a Somali refugee and is a naturalized American citizen, was viscerally attacked by Trump at his rally, prompting the \u201csend her back\u201d chants from the crowd. Responding on Twitter late Wednesday, Omar also quoted Maya Angelou, writing: You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I\u2019ll rise.\u201d The events at the Trump rally drew widespread condemnation, as Democrats rushed to Omar\u2019s defense and even some Republicans spoke out against the chants. Chants of \u201csend her back\u201d targeting Representative Ilhan Omar at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in North Carolina late Wednesday drew widespread condemnation from both parties in Washington. Democrats and Republicans alike spoke out against the nativist chant that erupted at Trump\u2019s rally after the president attacked Omar, a Somali refugee and naturalized US citizen, from the podium. \u201cIt saddens me beyond belief that the standard-bearer for the Republican Party, my Party, is making \u2018Send her back\u2019 his re-election rallying cry,\u201d Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and conservative radio host tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s so ugly. It\u2019s so un-American. It just saddens me beyond belief.\u201d Matt Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish coalition, said: \u201cThe \u2018send her back\u2019 chants were wrong, vile, and don\u2019t reflect who we are as Americans. I strongly oppose @IlhanMN views and policies but those chants have no place in our society.\u201d The chants, which harkened back to the \u201clock her up\u201d chants against Hillary Clinton at Trump\u2019s 2016 rallies, broke out after Trump attacked Omar with a series of falsehoods at his rally. The president has targeted Omar and three other congresswomen of color -- Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts -- as he ramps up his reelection campaign. Trump has nonetheless intensified his focus on Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, branding her as \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 for her criticism of US policy toward Israel. \u201cShe looks down with contempt on the hardworking Americans saying that ignorance is pervasive in many parts of this country,\u201d Trump said of Omar on Wednesday. \u201cAnd obviously, and importantly, Omar has a history of launching vicious anti-Semitic screeds.\u201d It was then that the crowd began chanting \u201csend her back!\u201d as Trump looked on. \u201cSo that\u2019s Omar,\u201d he noted. Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as Trump\u2019s White House communications director, criticized the events at the rally. \u201cIt is against the idealistic values of America,\u201d he told CNN on Thursday morning. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s really about the ideas of America, what we stand for as a country.\u201d But pressed on whether Trump was racist and why he continued to support the president, Scaramucci pushed back. \u201cDon\u2019t make it a moral question,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tweets are racist. But I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s a racist, and he\u2019s done a very good job for the country.\u201d Republican Tom Emmer, who represents Minnesota alongside Omar in Congress, also claimed Trump \u201cdoes not have a racist bone in his body\u201d. Although Emmer said he did not watch Trump\u2019s rally, he told a reporter there is \u201cno place\u201d for the chants against Omar. Good morning everyone! Sabrina Siddiqui here, ready to take you through the day\u2019s events in Washington. Donald Trump kicked off another firestorm at his rally in North Carolina on Wednesday night, where his attacks on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar prompted chants of \u201cSend her back!\u201d from the crowd. It was an especially ugly display, even by Trump rally standards. Omar arrived in the US at a young age as a Somali refugee and is a naturalized US citizen. In November, she became one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Trump went after Omar and her peers -- Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts -- in a set of racist tweets earlier this week. The president originally said the four congresswomen of color -- all US citizens -- should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they \u201ccame from\u201d. But Trump\u2019s attacks on Omar have remained especially visceral, as evidenced by his rally late Wednesday. Stay tuned for reaction to Trump\u2019s rally and other news in politics.",

      "bodyText": "The first, furry glimpses of the upcoming live action Cats remake have left viewers distressed and unhappy after its feline creatures were described as \u201ccursed\u201d and nightmarish. The transmogrified CGI human-cat hybrids were unveiled on Thursday night, to widespread horror. On Twitter, many found the mutated dancing forms to be troubling, describing them as \u201ccursed\u201d and \u201clike a Doctor Who episode from 2005\u201d. Cats is the story of a tribe of cats, called the Jellicles, that face a series of difficult life-altering decisions one fateful night. The live-action remake is helmed by Tom Hooper, the Oscar-winning director of The King\u2019s Speech, and stars Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Jason Derulo, Taylor Swift, Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench. But many fans did not appreciate what had happened to these beloved actors \u2013 namely, that they had become cats. Others complained about the size of the cats (too small), asked why they had visible breasts, and pointed out they appeared to be wearing the fur of other cats. It had already been revealed in April that the cats in the remake of Cats would be the size of cats. But on Thursday, many asked why such well-known actors of stage and screen had been deformed in such way, rather than just wear costumes like in the original 1981 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. In May, the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie was immediately redesigned, after widespread revulsion at the CGI appearance of Sonic in its first trailer. Director Jeff Fowler announced \u201cchanges\u201d would be made due to the reaction to the three-minute clip. The Guardian\u2019s Keith Stuart described the main character as \u201ca cheap knock-off Sonic toy your child might win at a fairground stand and then be terrified of\u201d. \u201cThe message is loud and clear... you aren\u2019t happy with the design &amp; you want changes. It\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Fowler said. Similar controversy erupted over the first trailer for Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, which eventually opened to good reviews. The original musical debuted on the West End in 1981, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and based on a T.S Eliot\u2019s collection of fantasy poems, Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats.
