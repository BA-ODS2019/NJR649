I write the songs for Depeche Mode.\u201d And then he stormed off.

Since then she\u2019s released her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/20/christine-and-the-queens-chris-album-review\">second album, Chris</a>, a more challenging record than her self-titled debut and one that didn\u2019t quite reach its predecessor\u2019s commercial peak. But just as it took an appearance on this very stage to mint her star, so does her headline performance tonight galvanise the field: there\u2019s the saucy funk of Girlfriend with its outrageous body rolls, the flowing bodily undulations of The Walker, and a refresh of Paradis Perdu that swaps its original sample of Kanye West\u2019s Heartless for Luniz\u2019s I Got 5 on It; her clear lineage to pop history, made manifest in a brief sample of Janet Jackson\u2019s Nasty and a stunning a cappella rendition of Bowie\u2019s Heroes. </p> <p>I can\u2019t lie \u2013 I\u2019ve seen her do this show enough times that I could do the choreography, and I can\u2019t dance. But every time, it yields something new: the dances are of course choreographed, as in any high concept pop show, but the emotion always feels immediate \u2013 the pain on her face during What\u2019s Her Face, a song about being exiled by mainstream culture, the vulnerability she exudes when she removes her shirt, faces the back of the stage and flexes her back muscles in a balletic display of strength. She\u2019s in tune with the festival\u2019s spirit, too \u2013 she aptly labels it \u201cGlastonfreaky\u201d, says she\u2019s been craving a return ever since 2016, and clubby closer Intranquilit\u00e9 is the perfect bridge for those heading to the South East corner for one last night of debauchery.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T22:36:17.416Z\">at 11.36pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1935f18f081e87273515a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T22:26:53.675Z\">11.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sorry, was just fetching the pictures below while they raced through Why Can\u2019t I Be You? like they were the Ramones, and finish with Boy\u2019s Don\u2019t Cry. That\u2019s why the Cure are what they are: they can play a run of hits that rival anything you will hear at any festival. It reminds me of seeing Madness here a few years ago, and you realise how tightly wound they are into the fabric of British pop music. But what makes them loved profoundly by many \u2013 and I\u2019m in the camp that knows how can great they be but does not love them \u2013 is the stuff that left me chilly, and means they are the hugest cult band in Britain, possibly the world. It\u2019s an amazing thing, to generate love like that, but it is wonderful when they let absolutely everyone in with those incredible hits.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1934cc8f080e82851521a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T22:21:31.600Z\">11.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s some more of David Levene\u2019s pictures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1253aa126d50acb2ad1fc1f88a8e7c2c0ef670c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1253aa126d50acb2ad1fc1f88a8e7c2c0ef670c4/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Smith \u2026 reaching for the stars \u2026\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Smith \u2026 reaching for the stars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34f759e99f0e9320ecdb754b8284b7f6fa70eeef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34f759e99f0e9320ecdb754b8284b7f6fa70eeef/0_0_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"and eyes on the prize.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026 and eyes on the prize.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c886bba3fe3b834d87b48eca3f67631f66864e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c886bba3fe3b834d87b48eca3f67631f66864e8/0_409_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Having a laugh on the Pyramid Stage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Having a laugh on the Pyramid Stage</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T22:40:05.363Z\">at 11.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1934658f082364d7cf3d2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T22:15:38.315Z\">11.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And Close to Me.

Launching into the UK garage-infused classics from that debut, Skinner sets the punishingly busy tent off into an immediate mosh pit, one that does not relent throughout their headline set.</p> <p>Despite a supposed retirement in 2011, The Streets re-formed in 2018 and are on word-perfect form, Skinner\u2019s now-gravelly voice shouting through numbers like his anti-mindfulness manifesto Geezers Need Excitement and Don\u2019t Mug Yourself. The live band is a nice addition, embellishing sparse tracks like It\u2019s Too Late and allowing Skinner the space to ad lib (mainly about said mosh pit) to the crowd and even have \u201cthe most chilled out crowdsurf\u201d during sad-boy anthem Dry Your Eyes.</p> <p>The momentum lags on the slower numbers though, especially the guitar-led balladry from 2011\u2019s overly-introspective Computer and Blues. Instead, it\u2019s the jumped-up energy of their breakout hit Fit But You Know It and dancefloor regular Has It Come To This which cements Skinner\u2019s position as the pioneer of the lager-spraying school of UK hip-hop which has now spawned talents such as Slowthai. Skinner may be older and somewhat slower than his early-2000s heyday but it\u2019s an aptly energetic close to the John Peel stage, providing enough enthusiasm for the punters to at least get through the gruelling journey home.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T21:55:11.520Z\">at 10.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d192ce68f082364d7cf3d25\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T21:46:31.093Z\">10.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Shake Dog Shake sounding simply immense.

What should bands do at festival headline sets? Should they do whatever they please, or should they play the hits, given the crowd is largely made up of the curious rather than the devoted. I used to think the former. More unpredictable, more exciting. I changed my mind at Glastonbury in 2016, standing in the mud, watching New Order, when they played a set that eschewed the hits until the end. Indoors, at a New Order show, I would have loved it. Outdoors, in a big crowd, I wanted to feel part of something bigger. And a set that delivers to the committed fans does not make you feel part of something bigger. I felt the same away when Springsteen played here \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have played a Boss set; he should have gone outright for everything that neutrals know, whether or not he wanted to \u2013 he should have given them Born in the USA and I\u2019m on Fire and so on.

His set on the Other Stage kicks off with flames and bombast, but some of the most spine-tingling moments are when he\u2019s at his most stripped-back \u2013 whether performing his profound, politically charged single Black against a monochrome backdrop, or delivering an impromptu motivational speech and a capella verse detailing his journey from selling mixtapes at school, to making his number one album, Psychodrama. A calm and crisp performer, his poignant lyricism can easily command the stage. But the set crescendoes with a run of three warm, melodic summer singles, perfect for the final night of this sweltering Glastonbury: Location, No Words, and his biggest hit to date, Funky Friday, featuring Fredo. </p> <p>Unexpectedly, the set also turns in one of the best surprise guests of Glastonbury. Before performing his AJ Tracey collaboration Thiago Silva, Dave calls up to the stage a member of the crowd named Alex, who is wearing a Thiago Silva shirt and a bucket hat. Alex gets mic\u2019ed up by the crew, and \u2013 improbably, as these stunts almost always end in secondhand embarrassment \u2013 knows every single word to the song, and performs it like a champ. The crowd is roaring, and it\u2019s one of the most feel-good moments of the festival so far, to see a superfan performing side by side with his favourite artist. Props to Alex, who is definitely absolutely buzzing right now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/1Xtra/status/1145427547158732802\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FUNKY SUNDAY \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Santandave1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Santandave1</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fredo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@fredo</a> closing an epic performance \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BBCGlasto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BBCGlasto</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Glastonbury2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Glastonbury2019</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jq54n4DsdX\">pic.twitter.com/jq54n4DsdX</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 1Xtra (@1Xtra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1Xtra/status/1145427547158732802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T21:04:08.854Z\">at 10.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d191b4c8f081e872735155b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T20:31:20.085Z\">9.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Obviously, I\u2019ll be flipping between things, but in honour of Robert Smith\u2019s support for QPR, I shall be rating each song I see as QPR player.

It was the first one that was on telly, and we were the first band that appeared on telly from Glastonbury. That was a minor claim to fame. They were pretty good. Better than Marion.

Their tropical pop-euphoria is just the kind of sundown set that\u2019s needed after a weekend of having it in the dank South East Corner. </p> <p>There are flavours of Chic by way of George Michael (there\u2019s a lot of George Michael) with plenty of sexy sax and congas. New track Heaven Let Me In \u2013 from their just-announced album, Inflorescent \u2013 is another blissful homage to uplifting house, like the riff on Jamie Principle\u2019s Your Love that made their name. And their old emo-Balearic hits like Jump in the Pool and Paris still sound suitably epic and as bright as their Hawaiian shirts.</p> <p>Ed Macfarlane, meanwhile, is an underrated frontman \u2013 he\u2019s got crystal-clear pipes and excellent trouser-snake moves, as during Jump in the Pool when he wiggles his hips to fanatical screams. It does make you wish more people threw shapes like that on stage and looked as if they were truly in the moment. </p> <p>They end on Kiss of Life, another glorious reminder that Friendly Fires are the party band you almost forgot you needed in your life.

Highlights come on the gunshot verbal scatter of Venom, the sweetly melodic Selfish and early cut God Bless Mary, dedicated to Simz\u2019s nextdoor neighbour who tolerated her loud, late-night early bedroom productions. </p> <p>The show takes an incongruous turn when Simz takes up a bass to play along to her DJ\u2019s selections of Erykah Badu\u2019s Bag Lady and the Notorious BIG\u2019s Juicy, dissipating the crowd\u2019s energy. Yet, things soon pick up with the gospel-backed Flowers and here Simz demonstrates the wide-ranging talent of today\u2019s British rap. It is a field that has space and, crucially, an audience for everything from Stefflon Don\u2019s tongue-in-cheek sauciness to Slowthai\u2019s hedonism and Simz\u2019s pensive lyricism. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T19:58:07.016Z\">at 8.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1912798f080e828515213f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T19:50:38.949Z\">8.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/secretglasto/status/1145418107063869442\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chris Martin is currently outside the Cure&#39;s dressing room who have turned the light off and are pretending to be out.</p>&mdash; Secretglasto (@secretglasto) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/secretglasto/status/1145418107063869442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d19125f8f081e8727351538\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T19:49:56.059Z\">8.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ryan_mcdona1d/status/1145407920991027206\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s some other world events that Chris Martin has just randomly shown up to other than Kylie and stormzy <a href=\"https://t.co/vXv4YXsBpl\">pic.twitter.com/vXv4YXsBpl</a></p>&mdash; Ryan McDonald (@ryan_mcdona1d) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryan_mcdona1d/status/1145407920991027206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1911708f082364d7cf3cb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T19:47:45.017Z\">8.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great secret to Dave\u2019s success: he\u2019s smart, raps well, he\u2019s approachable and relatable, and he\u2019s got some great hooks.

Greeted by a crowd of fizzing, enraptured teenage girls, she wastes no time launching into one of her most snarling singles right out of the gate: Bad Guy is an incongruous goth-pop rager, which partway through flips into a chopped and screwed coda. The moment she embodies the transition, fixing the crowd with intense eye contact, is magnetic. And that\u2019s just the first song. </p> <p>Eilish was bumped up to the Other stage in recognition of the fact that the last two years have been explosive for her, going from the viral Soundcloud hit Ocean Eyes to her massive 2019 debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go-review\">When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go</a>.

And, after a set full of gnarly moshing, it\u2019s surreal to watch her play the song that started it all, Ocean Eyes \u2013 a gentle whisper of a ballad. </p> <p>The mood is momentarily sad when she expresses a moment of jealousy of the crowd, saying: \u201cThis looks fun to go to \u2013 I would love to go to this shit, my God.\u201d Still only 17, she\u2019s coming of age under scrutiny, and will possibly never get to experience what it\u2019s like to attend a festival like Glastonbury as anything other than a celebrity. But throughout the rest of the set, it\u2019s heartwarming to see the obvious joy she takes performing with her brother, Finneas O\u2019Connell (who writes and produces all of the music with her). She wields her mic like a rock icon, styles herself like an emo SoundCloud rapper, and sings like an angelic indie songwriter \u2013 but unmistakably, performs with the pull and charisma of a pop star.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T19:25:48.799Z\">at 8.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1909238f082364d7cf3c90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T19:11:08.536Z\">8.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My kids often tell me, a ginger man, \u201cGingers have no soul.\u201d Vile little sods.

With the Walker fans far from the vicinity, Don starts her set to a criminally small crowd \u2013 one of the sparsest I\u2019ve seen on a main stage all weekend. No matter though as she shells the front rows with venomous lines taken from her two mix tapes and last year\u2019s debut EP, Hurtin\u2019 Me.</p> <p>The sub-rattling French Montana-featuring title track of that EP is a highlight of the set \u2013 Don\u2019s most recognisable tune and one which she performs accompanied by a slick dance routine in front of the gargantuan mirrored lettering of her name. The only setback is that since so many of her tracks are guest verses on other artists\u2019 releases \u2013 Shot and Wine with Sean Paul, Bum Bum Tam Tam with J Balvin and Future \u2013 her otherwise smooth flow lags as she waits for her bars to come along. </p> <p>As she closes her set, though, the tent is three-quarters full, the bemused crowd hanging off her every word on the dick-pic-inspired Ding-a-Ling. Don can scatter through grime, wile out to dancehall and put on a dance routine to rival tonight\u2019s Other stage headliners Christine and the Queens.

They headlined End of the Road last year, a gig that was supposed to have postdated the release of their new album. Obviously, the album didn\u2019t arrive in time, but they still came over to Europe to do that one-off show, at a festival that can\u2019t afford to pay huge fees \u2013 my bet is they lost money on honouring that booking. So all hail to them. It also had one of my favourite festival moments, when some kids at the front were pleading to come up on stage. Ezra Koenig, laughing, helped them up, and said they could sing Wolcott to close the show. At which point it became apparent that they had no idea about any Vampire Weekend songs, which Koenig thought was hilarious. One of the kids was in a wheelchair, and just did wheelies back and forth across the stage. It was great.

Her current styling is \u201chard rock karaoke at a gritty midwest bar\u201d, and she has her fair share of grungy belters, but her latest EP also features a fairly self-explanatory rap track called Catitude that she performs while crawling across the Pyramid stage, and that you imagine was written expressly in the hope of scoring a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/rupaul-s-drag-race-episode-by-episode\">Drag Race</a> sync. </p> <p>At this point in her mercurial, often controversial career, it\u2019s pretty clear that these things reflect the many multitudes of Miley, who stomps around the Pyramid stage in wet-look leather and a tiny skin-tight vest, yet spouts new-age wisdom (\u201cthe Killers fucking rocked and it scared the fuck out of me, but I ask the universe every day, show me something that scares the fuck out of me\u201d) and cries as she sings The Most, a song about her mum. </p> <p>The glorious thing about Miley is that she doesn\u2019t really make any sense, and her chaotic energy is the thing that binds it all together and keeps everyone goggling even when she makes moves that would traditionally result in shedding followers \u2013 the Pyramid field is packed, surprisingly. She covers Amy Winehouse and Dolly Parton, brings out her dad Billy Ray and rapper Lil Nas X for the latter\u2019s Old Town Road, and wears a lilac wig to play On a Roll, the \u201chit\u201d from the episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/01/miley-cyrus-black-mirror-rachel-jack-ashley-too\">Black Mirror</a> where she plays ill-fated pop star Ashley O.

They are by now Britain\u2019s biggest metal band, as well as the festival\u2019s token heavy main stagers. Their show is arena-sized, with a catwalk along the back for them to grind their axes along and Janet Jackson-rivalling dancers, who mosh around the musicians, and a song in which they appear to duet with the film character The Crow, who looms on the visuals behind.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>But though they have the heaviness to reign supreme in the metal world, they also have an appealing commercial edge, straying into EDM at points. As such they seem seem stuck between the two realms, perhaps condemned to the Other stage for life. Their show, with the bombast of Queen, is a spectacle at least.

At one point, he announced that he broke up with his girlfriend last week, and got everyone in the crowd who\u2019s going through a break-up to give a mournful cheer. His vocals shone on sad bangers from his most recent mixtape, Endorphins, but the true highlights of the set were his off-kilter breakthrough hit Party Here (including his lithe, wiry footwork) and the boisterous Skepta-featuring single Bet \u2013 a song so infectious that even the security staff were spotted skanking.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d18c87f8f081e8727351329\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T14:35:20.558Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oh.

Anyone can spout empty bromides about peace and love from a stage, but 79-year-old Mavis Staples gives hers real meaning and power in this absolutely magnificent Pyramid stage set. Delivered in a throaty holler, her songs about love and social justice are full of simple, digestible, but poetic truths: \u201cWhat good is freedom if we haven\u2019t learned to be free?\u201d she asks early on. These open-hearted questions harden and galvanise on Who Told You That: \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna rock the boat \u2013 who told you that?\u201d she asks, brilliantly sly and lupine.</p> <p>Via classic 12-bar electric blues and a cover of activist anthem For What It\u2019s Worth by Buffalo Springfield, she warms her heart back up, imploring the crowd in a glorious, ferocious yell to \u201ctouch somebody!\u201d English reserve melts as strangers gingerly reach out to each other. She ends by castigating \u201cthat \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to call it \u2013 that one in the White House\u201d, pleading for gun reform and an end to the imprisonment of migrant children at the US border. \u201cI might just run for president!\u201d she decides.

The speakers \u2013 Matthew Collins from Hope Not Hate, Faiza Shaheen from the think tank Class, Sheffield\u2019s enigmatic Lord Mayor, Majid, and Amos Schonfeld, founder of youth movement Our Second Home \u2013 have done enough of that in the past. Instead, this discussion was geared towards action and solutions, exploring what resistance means in an age when far-right ideology is becoming ever more mainstream.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>On banning or no-platforming as a tactic for fighting back, Majid spoke on his headline-grabbing move to ban Donald Trump from the city of Sheffield during a state visit: \u201cYes, America are our friends, but when my friend\u2019s being a prick I say, \u2018Mate, get your shit together.\u2019\u201d Others spoke on the importance of compassion and celebrating difference. Shaheen, who is standing against Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford in the next general election, partly as a protest against his \u201cincredibly cruel\u201d welfare reforms, said that she had found herself redressing her assumptions about people when doorstepping Ukip voters, and finding them open to changing their minds. \u201cJust in having that conversation, and being humanised \u2026 You\u2019d be surprised by how far you can engage with some people.\u201d</p> <p>The most important point iterated by each panelist, though, was a need to challenge hateful rhetoric wherever and whenever we see it, even if that means responding to \u201cendless abuse, diet tips and death threats\u201d on Twitter, as it does for activist Matt Collins. \u201cWe have to stand up for what we believe.\u201d For Majid, just being visible and consistently true to his core beliefs is a way of fighting hate. When his appointment as mayor instigated abuse, he says: \u201cI suddenly realised my mere existence was a form of resistance.\u201d Despite facing racist hate mail, he refused to tone down his politics. \u201cI\u2019m a black Muslim refugee immigrant \u2013 how can I not be political? If you\u2019re trying to be anyone\u2019s cup of tea, you might as well be a mug.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MrVikas/status/1145298989987827712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Amazing panel with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHopeNotHate?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MattHopeNotHate</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MagicMagid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MagicMagid</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faizashaheen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@faizashaheen</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/renireni?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@renireni</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AJSchonfield?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AJSchonfield</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlastoFest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GlastoFest</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GlastoLive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GlastoLive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jm7yT3Smvg\">pic.twitter.com/jm7yT3Smvg</a></p>&mdash; Vikas Shah MBE (@MrVikas) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrVikas/status/1145298989987827712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T14:34:42.926Z\">at 3.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d18a8958f080e8285151e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T12:19:34.952Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hot off the presses!

Headlining the Other stage, the Chemical Brothers could easily make a similar claim. For anyone who grew up watching Glastonbury on TV, the sound of Hey Boy, Hey Girl throbbing across montages of Worthy Farm is a familiar one. So there\u2019s a built-in nostalgia to their set, amplified by the dusky sky, the constant smoky pop of flares being lit and a high density of Glastonbury\u2019s iconic flags \u2013 but not to the degree that the crowd are twiddling their thumbs waiting for the hits.</p> <p>The material from new album No Geography is just as joyfully chaotic as the stuff from their heyday \u2013 chemical explosions of bright synths girded by twisted robot yowls. They pull off bold, breathless transitions, from ravey sirens that bark like an orchestra of seals into sharply overdriven, twinkly brightness, the effect akin to being dropped off a cliff. Saturate, from 2007\u2019s We Are the Night, is luscious and overwhelming, a powerful jazz drumbeat thrashing amid its hopeful ascending synths. With Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons ensconced in a flight deck\u2019s worth of synths, the visuals transmit the playfulness at the heart of their music \u2013 a new song, Got to Keep On, has the best of the lot, a kind of silky pink Michelin man made of petals swaggering along a treadmill.</p> <p>Nothing, obviously, is as visceral as their admirably spare deployment of the hits: they tease Hey Boy, Hey Girl with a flirty intro, then trigger that roiling beat and helter-skelter cry \u2013 \u201cHere we go!\u201d; Galvanise still sounds regally intimidating. It\u2019s easy to overlook the Chems as their hipper, more avant-garde successors take over \u2013 as they should \u2013 but in their spiritual home, they prove why they\u2019ll always be Britain\u2019s beloved rave dads.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T12:01:48.299Z\">at 1.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d189fc48f080e8285151dfd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T11:41:27.656Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Kylie is officially on site</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kylieminogue/status/1145289642142588928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dreams DO come true!!!

Speaking to the Guardian before the set, she explained how being a lifelong grime fan prepared her for the show:</p> <p>\u201cSign language is my first language \u2013 I\u2019ve got family members who are deaf. But I never even considered going into [interpreting music] until going to a couple of festivals with my deaf friends, and then I saw the need for it. There\u2019s not many interpreters who interpret music and do festivals, there\u2019s a shortage nationally. Not all deaf people are into music, there are some who are and some who aren\u2019t, the same way that not every single hearing person wants to go to a music festival. I know that a couple of Stormzy\u2019s biggest deaf fans are here, so it\u2019s really nice to know that they\u2019re going to get a wonderful experience.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve listened to grime music since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/20/attack-the-block-how-grimes-visuals-went-pop\">Risky Roadz</a> days, since the very beginning, so it\u2019s easier for me, because I understand the context, the slang, all that stuff. Yes, grime is often faster, but sometimes you may get a rock song that\u2019s very difficult to convey in sign language. But each to their own. I like to stick with grime.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b18efdca453b6a766632edb213610a492dce5c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b18efdca453b6a766632edb213610a492dce5c3/0_0_5047_3365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bastille performing on the Pyramid stage on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bastille performing on the Pyramid stage on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Benjamin Gorman</strong></p> <p>DeafZone volunteer Benajmin Gorman is the first deaf BSL interpreter to work at Glastonbury. On Friday, he interpreted Bastille\u2019s Pyramid stage set for a deaf audience. He told the Guardian:<br></p> <p>\u201cGlastonbury is a fantastic music festival, but it\u2019s not just about the music; it\u2019s about the atmosphere, it\u2019s about the camaraderie, and also the lovely food we\u2019re surrounded by, and the bit too much sun we\u2019re experiencing. Festivals aren\u2019t always just about the music, it\u2019s about the overall experience of being part and parcel of the festival, and [interpreting is] about a deaf person being able to take part in that. There are various levels of hearing a person might have. Some deaf people have some residual hearing and can hear quite well; some have no residual hearing but they can experience music through vibrations. Also, the atmosphere really makes you connect with the acts and the artists. So a festival is an experience in itself. </p> <p>\u201cThe important thing is access. For deaf people, they deserve to have the same experience as anybody else who pays for a ticket to go to a festival. For myself, I think we need to show that deaf people are capable of [interpreting] as well.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T11:37:32.959Z\">at 12.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1899358f080e8285151ddc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T11:13:02.529Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The best of Saturday in pictures</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/30/janet-liam-and-slowthai-in-his-pants-saturday-at-glastonbury\">Janet, Liam and Slowthai in his pants: Saturday at Glastonbury</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1898068f082364d7cf393b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/laura-snapes\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T11:12:28.873Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">And we're back</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning from the blessedly cool Guardian cabin where constitutions are slightly fragile but morale remains high.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it from me, at the end of another Glastonbury that contained multitudes. I hope you heard something you loved over the last three days, and the rest of the year brings you more pleasures. And now the countdown to Fleetwood Mac next year (will they?) begins. Thanks for your company, even when you disagreed with me. There\u2019ll be loads of Glastonbury in tomorrow\u2019s G2, words and pictures, so give it a look. Goodnight! Our own Alexis Petridis weighs in on the festival-closer by these goth-pop veterans. Well, I could go on for hours \u2013 although perhaps the biggest story of this year\u2019s Glastonbury was how they really grasped the scale of the climate crisis. Hannah Jane Parkinson\u2019s feature on it is well worth reading. Other highlights? Slowthai\u2019s attempt to deal with Saturday\u2019s heat \u2026 in nothing but his pants. So that\u2019s it for the big performances, although the debauchery and dancing goes on at least until sunrise. Highlights? Kylie\u2019s showmanship \u2013 and the hits! \u2013 proved she deserves a promotion from legend slot to headline. Here\u2019s Laura Snapes\u2019 review from earlier in the day. Janelle Mon\u00e1e closed out the West Holts stage in a typically inspired outfit, looking like a deconstructed piano. Brief Cure story. Some time in the late 90s I saw them at the Astoria. Before they came on, I was chatting for quite a long time to a chap in a hat that cast his face in shadow. He was very pleasant: we were just talking about this and that. Eventually, I asked: \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d He looked up, and said: \u201cI\u2019m Martin Gore. I write the songs for Depeche Mode.\u201d And then he stormed off. The Cure were very good. Last one of these. I absolutely promise. But overall QPR rating: Adel Taarabt. Sublime at times. Great finishing. But I was frustrated. It\u2019s three years since Christine and the Queens made her Glastonbury debut on the Other stage, performing in a downpour hours after the Brexit bore came through and offering a radiant blast of European cosmopolitanism to a field of damp and downtrodden Brits. Since then she\u2019s released her second album, Chris, a more challenging record than her self-titled debut and one that didn\u2019t quite reach its predecessor\u2019s commercial peak. But just as it took an appearance on this very stage to mint her star, so does her headline performance tonight galvanise the field: there\u2019s the saucy funk of Girlfriend with its outrageous body rolls, the flowing bodily undulations of The Walker, and a refresh of Paradis Perdu that swaps its original sample of Kanye West\u2019s Heartless for Luniz\u2019s I Got 5 on It; her clear lineage to pop history, made manifest in a brief sample of Janet Jackson\u2019s Nasty and a stunning a cappella rendition of Bowie\u2019s Heroes. I can\u2019t lie \u2013 I\u2019ve seen her do this show enough times that I could do the choreography, and I can\u2019t dance. But every time, it yields something new: the dances are of course choreographed, as in any high concept pop show, but the emotion always feels immediate \u2013 the pain on her face during What\u2019s Her Face, a song about being exiled by mainstream culture, the vulnerability she exudes when she removes her shirt, faces the back of the stage and flexes her back muscles in a balletic display of strength. She\u2019s in tune with the festival\u2019s spirit, too \u2013 she aptly labels it \u201cGlastonfreaky\u201d, says she\u2019s been craving a return ever since 2016, and clubby closer Intranquilit\u00e9 is the perfect bridge for those heading to the South East corner for one last night of debauchery. Sorry, was just fetching the pictures below while they raced through Why Can\u2019t I Be You? like they were the Ramones, and finish with Boy\u2019s Don\u2019t Cry. That\u2019s why the Cure are what they are: they can play a run of hits that rival anything you will hear at any festival. It reminds me of seeing Madness here a few years ago, and you realise how tightly wound they are into the fabric of British pop music. But what makes them loved profoundly by many \u2013 and I\u2019m in the camp that knows how can great they be but does not love them \u2013 is the stuff that left me chilly, and means they are the hugest cult band in Britain, possibly the world. It\u2019s an amazing thing, to generate love like that, but it is wonderful when they let absolutely everyone in with those incredible hits. Here\u2019s some more of David Levene\u2019s pictures. And Close to Me. The most sceptical must be won over by this rush of songs. And now everyone in front of the Pyramid stage is dancing and singing, and even watching on television it\u2019s electrifying: to see the faces of the crowd and the happiness on them is like a rush of joy. The interlocking guitars of Friday I\u2019m in Love simply blossom, and you can feel the serotonin levels shoot off the scale. And another of Christine \u2026 A great Caterpillar and into The Walk. Like the Killers last night, the Cure are rolling out the big guns one after the other, and suddenly all the rest seems like the necessary preparation for the big release of joy. And here\u2019s a pic from Christine and the Queens\u2019 set \u2013 the little bit of which I saw looked great. \u201cTen minutes to put my pop head on,\u201d says Robert Smith. Then after a pause says: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to translate what we do \u2026 But this is Glastonbury.\u201d Suggesting half an hour of pop hits, beginning with the gorgeous Lullaby. Of course, what makes the Cure such a significant band is their ability to shuffle between songs that make a profound connection to the devoted and those the non-committed love. Smith\u2019s remarks suggest maybe he found switching between the two tricky tonight. Sauntering on to the John Peel stage in an all-black tracksuit, Mike Skinner still exudes the excitable geezer vibe of his Original Pirate Material days \u2013 an everyman for the Carling-toting crowd. Launching into the UK garage-infused classics from that debut, Skinner sets the punishingly busy tent off into an immediate mosh pit, one that does not relent throughout their headline set. Despite a supposed retirement in 2011, The Streets re-formed in 2018 and are on word-perfect form, Skinner\u2019s now-gravelly voice shouting through numbers like his anti-mindfulness manifesto Geezers Need Excitement and Don\u2019t Mug Yourself. The live band is a nice addition, embellishing sparse tracks like It\u2019s Too Late and allowing Skinner the space to ad lib (mainly about said mosh pit) to the crowd and even have \u201cthe most chilled out crowdsurf\u201d during sad-boy anthem Dry Your Eyes. The momentum lags on the slower numbers though, especially the guitar-led balladry from 2011\u2019s overly-introspective Computer and Blues. Instead, it\u2019s the jumped-up energy of their breakout hit Fit But You Know It and dancefloor regular Has It Come To This which cements Skinner\u2019s position as the pioneer of the lager-spraying school of UK hip-hop which has now spawned talents such as Slowthai. Skinner may be older and somewhat slower than his early-2000s heyday but it\u2019s an aptly energetic close to the John Peel stage, providing enough enthusiasm for the punters to at least get through the gruelling journey home. Shake Dog Shake sounding simply immense. Intoxicatingly good. I\u2019m not going to retreat from saying it was a slow start, but this set is starting to fly for me now. Yes, I know it was flying for plenty of you earlier. I\u2019ve not seen any of Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s set, but hearing great things about it. Looks like it was a bit of a spectacular, too. And now the Cure are on to A Forest, which I would be happy to have last hours and hours, droning on brilliantly and moodily. I wonder if Wipers and the Cure were listening to each other, because A Forest sounds very much like what Greg Sage was doing several thousand miles away in Portland at the same time, this strange, haunted, arid music. QPR rating: Adel Taarabt. South London rapper Flohio may be one of the most hyped by \u2013 ahem \u2013 metropolitan media types, but that doesn\u2019t always translate into popularity. Up against other rap and hip-hop in the east side of the site, like Tion Wayne doing megahit Keisha and Becky about 50 metres away, and the Streets headlining the John Peel stage not too far beyond that, she\u2019s got competition, and when I turn up there are about 12 people watching. She still gives it her all, throwing her expert club flow into a series of trap tracks underpinned with headnodding dub energy. By the time her track Bands comes round, she\u2019s grown her crowd to 100 or so \u2013 still small beer, but the kind of performance whose word of mouth will keep her star rising. Clearly, I\u2019m in a minority among commenters (and Twitter people) in not thinking this is one of the great sets. *Shrugs* I can live with it. Again, I think it would be fantastic in an arena, surrounded by people who are really, really into it. I\u2019m interested to see what the Guardian\u2019s review will be like, whether it felt overwhelming in the crowd or not. Dorian Lynskey interviewed Robert Smith for the Guardian when he curated Meltdown last year. Have a read if so you wish. And now Just Like Heaven. The neutrals \u2013 yes, I am a neutral \u2013 are going to come back on board for this. The fact is that at festivals, hits buy you goodwill. Most of Disintegration doesn\u2019t. Back to the Cure for In Between Days, being taken at a brisk clip. And now there are flares alight in the crowd, and visible dancing a long way back. QPR rating: introduction of Bradley Allen as a late sub for Devon White. If you want to read what Robert Smith\u2019s week was like back when he was younger, try this diary piece he did for the late, lamented Flexipop. The Guardian\u2019s David Levene was in the pit at the start of the Cure\u2019s show. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I wanted something that sounded a little less like living in a damp bedroom in a shared house. Christine sounds sharp and tight. Pop that is seductive and disruptive, and lets you in even if you\u2019re not a superfan. The cheers from the Other Stage are louder on the iPlayer than the ones from the Pyramid are on the telly. I lost track of the set, because I was tying, but we\u2019re back with a single, Fascination Street. Guess which album it\u2019s from. Go on, guess. OK, so here\u2019s the question. What should bands do at festival headline sets? Should they do whatever they please, or should they play the hits, given the crowd is largely made up of the curious rather than the devoted. I used to think the former. More unpredictable, more exciting. I changed my mind at Glastonbury in 2016, standing in the mud, watching New Order, when they played a set that eschewed the hits until the end. Indoors, at a New Order show, I would have loved it. Outdoors, in a big crowd, I wanted to feel part of something bigger. And a set that delivers to the committed fans does not make you feel part of something bigger. I felt the same away when Springsteen played here \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have played a Boss set; he should have gone outright for everything that neutrals know, whether or not he wanted to \u2013 he should have given them Born in the USA and I\u2019m on Fire and so on. Something can be brilliant and unsuited to its environment at the same time. It\u2019s back to Disintegration for Lovesong. I suppose it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re leaning heavily on that album so far: they\u2019ve been playing it in full in various places around the world. It\u2019s a fan favourite, and it was their highest charting record. But this is shaping up to be a set that devotees hail as a masterpiece, while neutrals shrug. And Lovesong is followed by Last Dance from \u2026 Disintegration. High gets a QPR rating of Jan Stejskal. Solid performer. Now on to A Night Like This, from The Head on the Door, which sounds fantastic. I bet the fans are in raptures: this isn\u2019t a greatest hits set, but it\u2019s creating a solid mood \u2013 not of euphoria, but a kind of relaxed intensity. Bet it sounds amazing just a bit stoned. This is swelling and flowing like an ocean. Giving it a QPR rating of Shaun Derry: deserves more recognition. It all sounds lovely, but as Jeff observes: \u201cThey\u2019re not giving it the full Kylie, are they?\u201d Still, they\u2019ve left Disintegration behind. High is from 1992\u2019s Wish. Behold Jeff Goldblum and his trousers and shirt. It will not surprise you to learn this man consults a stylist every day. It\u2019s a one-two from Disintegration, with Pictures of You. I was joking yesterday when I said I hoped he played two hours of the gloomy stuff. I\u2019m giving this opening duo a QPR rating of Simon Barker and Ian Holloway: solid, and they very much do a job, but the neutrals don\u2019t come out for them. Plainsong \u2013 the QPR rating: Toni Leistner \u2013 solid, but lacking in pace. Dave is a gifted storyteller. His set on the Other Stage kicks off with flames and bombast, but some of the most spine-tingling moments are when he\u2019s at his most stripped-back \u2013 whether performing his profound, politically charged single Black against a monochrome backdrop, or delivering an impromptu motivational speech and a capella verse detailing his journey from selling mixtapes at school, to making his number one album, Psychodrama. A calm and crisp performer, his poignant lyricism can easily command the stage. But the set crescendoes with a run of three warm, melodic summer singles, perfect for the final night of this sweltering Glastonbury: Location, No Words, and his biggest hit to date, Funky Friday, featuring Fredo. Unexpectedly, the set also turns in one of the best surprise guests of Glastonbury. Before performing his AJ Tracey collaboration Thiago Silva, Dave calls up to the stage a member of the crowd named Alex, who is wearing a Thiago Silva shirt and a bucket hat. Alex gets mic\u2019ed up by the crew, and \u2013 improbably, as these stunts almost always end in secondhand embarrassment \u2013 knows every single word to the song, and performs it like a champ. The crowd is roaring, and it\u2019s one of the most feel-good moments of the festival so far, to see a superfan performing side by side with his favourite artist. Props to Alex, who is definitely absolutely buzzing right now. Obviously, I\u2019ll be flipping between things, but in honour of Robert Smith\u2019s support for QPR, I shall be rating each song I see as QPR player. Stan Bowles will be the highest rating, Shaun Wright-Phillips will be the lowest. As for the others, you\u2019ll have to work out what I think from the name of the player concerned. And they\u2019re opening dark, with Plainsong, from Disintegration. One for the purists, rather than the people who want to hear the it (ie me). Here\u2019s a picture of Years and Years for you. Those of you said it was Channel 4 in 1994 are right. But none of you got the right band. Let me hand you over to Saint Etienne\u2019s Bob Stanley: \u201cWe played Glastonbury. I didn\u2019t go. It was the first one that was on telly, and we were the first band that appeared on telly from Glastonbury. That was a minor claim to fame. They were pretty good. Better than Marion. Marion went to introduce a new song with a long, rambling introduction. And they cut to an ad break, so you never heard the song. That was Marion doomed. You knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen to them at that point.\u201d The geeks will inherit the earth. A decade on from when many assumed their natural sell by date would be, Vampire Weekend are the last blog rock band standing. Second down on the Pyramid stage seems a unlikely space for a band whose brand of studied naffness bears no relation to much of the rest of this year\u2019s line up \u2013 and yet here we are. The further they shift away from current trends \u2013 latest album Father of the Bride is their uncoolest yet \u2013 the more popular they become. Of course, it helps that they\u2019re a pretty formidable live band \u2013 precise and buzzing with energy. A-Punk and Cousins are irrepressibly busy bounce-alongs and the new tracks \u2013 Harmony Hall in particular \u2013 slot in seamlessly. Even their lamest indulgence \u2013 a duelling guitar solo \u2013 makes a strange amount of sense. Much has rightly been said this festival of the new British jazz scene, but unquestionably the hottest star in jazz right now is Kamasi Washington. Two years ago, he played a mid-afternoon slot on West Holts, now he\u2019s been elevated to second on the bill, and as the sun sets the LA saxophonist and his band provide a perfect scene \u2013 storming to a close with a Fists of Fury that is a funky as any blaxploitation cut, politically charged and as all-round magnificent as any big band could hope to sound in 2019. Roll on a headline slot next time round. Glasto 2019 has been a vintage year for mid-2000s indie bands: The Killers, Vampire Weekend, Foals and Interpol have all played to the masses, and now it\u2019s the turn of Friendly Fires, another band who have managed to transcend that era of indie student discos, hanging around Camden, and poring over NME. Their tropical pop-euphoria is just the kind of sundown set that\u2019s needed after a weekend of having it in the dank South East Corner. There are flavours of Chic by way of George Michael (there\u2019s a lot of George Michael) with plenty of sexy sax and congas. New track Heaven Let Me In \u2013 from their just-announced album, Inflorescent \u2013 is another blissful homage to uplifting house, like the riff on Jamie Principle\u2019s Your Love that made their name. And their old emo-Balearic hits like Jump in the Pool and Paris still sound suitably epic and as bright as their Hawaiian shirts. Ed Macfarlane, meanwhile, is an underrated frontman \u2013 he\u2019s got crystal-clear pipes and excellent trouser-snake moves, as during Jump in the Pool when he wiggles his hips to fanatical screams. It does make you wish more people threw shapes like that on stage and looked as if they were truly in the moment. They end on Kiss of Life, another glorious reminder that Friendly Fires are the party band you almost forgot you needed in your life. But they\u2019re back, and more brilliant than ever. So, BBC Two has now gone live, with highlights from earlier, as we wait for the Cure. And here are some top Cure facts: 1: Robert Smith doubles up as the artists Bob and Roberta Smith. 2: Simon Gallup\u2019s dad set up the Gallup polling company, and for several years the Cure chose their singles based on private polling from the Gallup organisation. 3: Boris Johnson started calling himself Boris, rather than Alexander, in tribute to 80s Cure drummer Boris Williams. I\u2019m now in Jeff\u2019s kitchen. That\u2019s how seamless this operation is. You didn\u2019t even notice I\u2019d gone, did you? With the release of her third album, Grey Area, this year at the age of only 25, Little Simz has marked herself out as a prodigiously talented rapper and storyteller, specialising in verbally dexterous, introspective verses that take in everything from mental health to gender politics. It is testament to the broad musical span of her releases \u2013 including the likes of trap-influenced bass to soulful melodies and dancefloor-focused rhythms \u2013 that her crowd at the Park stage is one of the most pleasingly diverse of the festival. Backed by a full band and dressed in white, Simz\u2019s set is polished and muscular, featuring most of the tracks from Grey Area. Highlights come on the gunshot verbal scatter of Venom, the sweetly melodic Selfish and early cut God Bless Mary, dedicated to Simz\u2019s nextdoor neighbour who tolerated her loud, late-night early bedroom productions. The show takes an incongruous turn when Simz takes up a bass to play along to her DJ\u2019s selections of Erykah Badu\u2019s Bag Lady and the Notorious BIG\u2019s Juicy, dissipating the crowd\u2019s energy. Yet, things soon pick up with the gospel-backed Flowers and here Simz demonstrates the wide-ranging talent of today\u2019s British rap. It is a field that has space and, crucially, an audience for everything from Stefflon Don\u2019s tongue-in-cheek sauciness to Slowthai\u2019s hedonism and Simz\u2019s pensive lyricism. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great secret to Dave\u2019s success: he\u2019s smart, raps well, he\u2019s approachable and relatable, and he\u2019s got some great hooks. He maybe doesn\u2019t have the same level of charisma as Stormzy, but I wouldn\u2019t be in the least surprised to see him top of the bill on one of the big stages next year. OK, here\u2019s a quiz question. Who were the first band ever to be shown live from Glastonbury on television? Tweet me your answers, to @michaelahann In case you wanted to read more about Dave, here\u2019s an interview with him from earlier this year, by Miranda Sawyer. It was really good of Miley Cyrus to get Fields of the Nephilim up on stage with her (ask your granddad, or anyone who worked for Melody Maker in the 1980s). Really pleased to see overwhelmingly positive thoughts about Billie Eilish in the comments. I think she\u2019s great. Turned over to Dave, just in time for 100 Ms, which \u2013 pop fans \u2013 had a video filmed in the streets around my house, and extensive segments filmed in Phoenicia, the excellent Middle Eastern deli on Kentish Town. I commend to you their whole roasted chickens, their baklava, their spinach flatbreads, their excellent range of pastas, and much more besides. I don\u2019t know if Dave tried the chicken when they filmed the video. That\u2019s the end for Vampire Weekend, so I\u2019ve popped over for a look at Kamasi Washington. Honestly, I\u2019m unlikely to be hanging around long. I can see he\u2019s brilliant, but it doesn\u2019t really float my boat. I went to see him earlier this year, and was slightly horrified that we got a six-hour drum battle in the middle of the set. Not least because talk of drum battles reminded me of my horrific experience interviewing Ginger Baker on stage, when he replied to my first attempt at conversation with: \u201cThat\u2019s a fucking stupid question.\u201d Yesterday I gave you the story of Chris Martin and the KP crisps at London Zoo. Today, the tale of Miley Cyrus\u2019s first gig in London. She was appearing at Koko, in a filmed Hannah Montana special, and I procured two tickets for my wife and daughter (I must have been watching some tawdry indie band in a pub), and along they went. When they got home, my wife reported that they had been ushered to the VIP area, where she spent the evening chatting some old fella who seemed to have brought along his granddaughter. He must have been famous, she said, because people kept coming up to him and being very respectful. She described him, and I Googled some photos and showed her. \u201cYes, that\u2019s him.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s PETE BLOODY TOWNSHEND! How can you have spent the evening talking to PETE BLOODY TOWNSHEND without recognising him?\u201d Here\u2019s someone famous watching Billie Eilish. There\u2019s an knowing wink in the Stella McCartney outfit that Billie Eilish wears to take to the Other stage, with the Beatles\u2019 logo emblazoned on her back. Greeted by a crowd of fizzing, enraptured teenage girls, she wastes no time launching into one of her most snarling singles right out of the gate: Bad Guy is an incongruous goth-pop rager, which partway through flips into a chopped and screwed coda. The moment she embodies the transition, fixing the crowd with intense eye contact, is magnetic. And that\u2019s just the first song. Eilish was bumped up to the Other stage in recognition of the fact that the last two years have been explosive for her, going from the viral Soundcloud hit Ocean Eyes to her massive 2019 debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go. Her strange allure is the way she can flip seamlessly from maximal rage to quiet intimacy. She\u2019s captivating when she lies motionless on the ground, singing the distorted and sleepy When I Was Older, just as she is when she\u2019s leaping around and kicking the air to the drop in Bellyache. And, after a set full of gnarly moshing, it\u2019s surreal to watch her play the song that started it all, Ocean Eyes \u2013 a gentle whisper of a ballad. The mood is momentarily sad when she expresses a moment of jealousy of the crowd, saying: \u201cThis looks fun to go to \u2013 I would love to go to this shit, my God.\u201d Still only 17, she\u2019s coming of age under scrutiny, and will possibly never get to experience what it\u2019s like to attend a festival like Glastonbury as anything other than a celebrity. But throughout the rest of the set, it\u2019s heartwarming to see the obvious joy she takes performing with her brother, Finneas O\u2019Connell (who writes and produces all of the music with her). She wields her mic like a rock icon, styles herself like an emo SoundCloud rapper, and sings like an angelic indie songwriter \u2013 but unmistakably, performs with the pull and charisma of a pop star. My kids often tell me, a ginger man, \u201cGingers have no soul.\u201d Vile little sods. Well, if you don\u2019t love Diane Young, YOU HAVE NO SOUL. \u201cOur outfit co-ordination started a few months ago. We all live in south London, we were going to Glastonbury, we knew Kylie would have the best dancing, so we had a fight over who got to be Kylie. Part of me thought it was because I was the short girl but I like to think it was because I was the fiercest. My costume was easy, the Internet sells this shit. The hardest was the backing dancers \u2013 guys were trying to borrow red dresses they couldn\u2019t fit into, a teacher taped acetate sheets to her head. We tried to plan a dance routine and we settled on Steps\u2019 Tragedy but a bit more wavy. We were about 10 rows back. I claimed that Especially for You was dedicated to me. My friends said it really fucking wasn\u2019t. Pushing to the front is so much easier in costumes \u2013 people are like, you dick! Then they see your costume and welcome you through. The only other people wearing it I\u2019ve seen have been very camp men.\u201d Vampire Weekend are doing my favourite song of the year so far, Harmony Hall, the only song that crosses early Fairport Convention with Italo House. Can I be honest with you? This song makes me cry. It really does, every time. I have tears in my eyes right now. Sadly, Vampire Weekend are ignoring my sage advice and have gone into New Dorp. New York. NO JAMMING! Laura Snapes reports that the Other stage is \u201cinsanely busy\u201d for Billie Eilish. While we\u2019re on the subject of teenage pop, readers last night might recall my mention of my son\u2019s \u201cdrill crew\u201d, Dartmouth Spartanz. He wanted me to mention his \u201cOG Spartan\u201d Hugo \u2013 this is not a crew who are going to strike fear into the gangs of north London \u2013 and makes this baffling observation: \u201cDARTMOUTH SPARTANZ C TOWN HOLD IT DOWN BABY RUNNING SHIT IN THE NORTHWEST NO CAP 6 2\u201d. Evs, sonny. Rapper Stefflon Don, whose song titles include Tight Nooki and Lil Bitch, is maybe not who you\u2019d expect to be following the mum-friendly singer-songwriter Tom Walker, but such is the near-random nature of the programming on the John Peel stage. With the Walker fans far from the vicinity, Don starts her set to a criminally small crowd \u2013 one of the sparsest I\u2019ve seen on a main stage all weekend. No matter though as she shells the front rows with venomous lines taken from her two mix tapes and last year\u2019s debut EP, Hurtin\u2019 Me. The sub-rattling French Montana-featuring title track of that EP is a highlight of the set \u2013 Don\u2019s most recognisable tune and one which she performs accompanied by a slick dance routine in front of the gargantuan mirrored lettering of her name. The only setback is that since so many of her tracks are guest verses on other artists\u2019 releases \u2013 Shot and Wine with Sean Paul, Bum Bum Tam Tam with J Balvin and Future \u2013 her otherwise smooth flow lags as she waits for her bars to come along. As she closes her set, though, the tent is three-quarters full, the bemused crowd hanging off her every word on the dick-pic-inspired Ding-a-Ling. Don can scatter through grime, wile out to dancehall and put on a dance routine to rival tonight\u2019s Other stage headliners Christine and the Queens. She is one of British rap\u2019s most captivating new talents. Here\u2019s a picture of Billie Eilish at the Other stage. I\u2019m just praying the constraints of a festival set mean Vampire Weekend decide to drop the Horchata/New Dorp. New York medley they\u2019ve been doing for the last year or so, because \u2013 to be honest \u2013 it\u2019s bloody endless, testament to the eternal desire of American bands to unleash their inner Grateful Dead. I suspect now they\u2019ve got Brian Robert Jones playing lead guitar \u2013 and he can, like, really play, maaaan \u2013 they feel the need to give him some chance to show off. Don\u2019t do that. Play the songs! It\u2019s all about the songs! NO JAMMING! I\u2019ve switched over from Billie Eilish to Vampire Weekend, who I think are one of the great modern guitar pop groups. I think they are funny, tuneful and clever, and that\u2019s quite enough for me. Also, I think they are good guys. They headlined End of the Road last year, a gig that was supposed to have postdated the release of their new album. Obviously, the album didn\u2019t arrive in time, but they still came over to Europe to do that one-off show, at a festival that can\u2019t afford to pay huge fees \u2013 my bet is they lost money on honouring that booking. So all hail to them. It also had one of my favourite festival moments, when some kids at the front were pleading to come up on stage. Ezra Koenig, laughing, helped them up, and said they could sing Wolcott to close the show. At which point it became apparent that they had no idea about any Vampire Weekend songs, which Koenig thought was hilarious. One of the kids was in a wheelchair, and just did wheelies back and forth across the stage. It was great. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s VW interview from last week. As Glasto this year has shifted focus to the climate emergency, there has only been a whiff of political skewering from the performers in 2019. Stormzy wore a stab vest for his headline show; Joe Goddard shouted \u201cFuck Boris\u201d at the end of Hot Chip\u2019s set; there are a few other examples here and there; but it does feel a bit like the malaise has well and truly set in. Damon Albarn senses this and uses his show with The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen to remind people not to lose faith. \u201cThree years ago we came here and opened on the Friday with the Syrian National Orchestra. It was the Friday after the referendum, and we were really shocked. It became a mission to work out what\u2019s going on here.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t engage with it enough,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, simply: don\u2019t give up politics. You might give up on politicians but don\u2019t give up on democracy itself,\u201d before launching into deranged vaudevillian dub tune The Truce of Twilight. It was to be expected from a band \u2013 comprised of, among others, Paul Simonon of the Clash and the godfather of Afrobeat, Tony Allen \u2013 whose last album was on the theme of Brexit. The group marries Albarn\u2019s two majors \u2013 Britishness and African music \u2013 with a rowdy Dickensian flair, Albarn as the Artful Dodger acting up to the crowd. It\u2019s fun to see him being cocky, as if he has a new lease of life, and amusing to see how his bandmates blithely ignore his antics \u2013 falling down to the floor in mock shock being one. But then he is serious again. \u201cInteresting fact,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you know what they call England in Iran? Englishtan. Fill in the rest of the essay. Can\u2019t have any of that terrible xenophobic attitude in England. This is been a great festival to dispel that,\u201d and then he plays a \u201chealing song for a healing festival\u201d, the Dylanesque acoustic number Ribbons. He\u2019s right: it\u2019s been the most diverse Glastonbury yet, and it\u2019s all the better for it. Here\u2019s a nice pic of Kylie and Nick Cave discussing which battered halloumi stall they think is better. OK, here\u2019s the plan, and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve carried out before. So I know it works. I\u2019m going to be on my sofa until nine. But Sunday night is the evening I go to the pub with my friend Jeff. Always. Unless he\u2019s in court on the Monday morning (he\u2019s a barrister, not a criminal). Obviously, taking my laptop to the pub would be a little impractical. So instead, at nine, I will be taking a five minute break and walking round to his house, where I will set up again, and drink his beer, and eat the remains of whatever takeaway he and his family had earlier (the problem with liveblogging is that you can\u2019t stop to make your tea). So this is, genuinely, the only TWO LOCATION GLASTONBURY LIVEBLOG in British media. And do they ever give me prizes for this groundbreaking approach to journalism? Do they buffalo! Billie Eilish is doing Wish U Were Gay now, which is the single song with the biggest discrepancy between the awfulness of the title and the goodness of the song of the entire year. And also the one I compared to Cole Porter. I had to review Kylie doing a little club show at Cafe de Paris not very long ago, when she launched her country album. I was sitting in the balcony, scribbling in my notebook as she sang. She was, I guess, 20 feet away. Now, when arena stars go to clubs, they don\u2019t usually change their gestures. They\u2019re still projecting to somewhere 100 yards away. And they do all the big point-and-wave gestures they do to anonymous space in arenas, except in a club, there\u2019s actually someone there. I looked up from my notebook, having been scribbled, to be confronted with Kylie doing the arena point-and-wave. At me. With all the people on the floor, turning to see what she was pointing and waving at. It was EXCRUCIATING. Not least because I wasn\u2019t wearing any glitter or feathers. Rounding off my Glastonbury Gastodyssey with that classic, super healthy festival snack, battered halloumi \u2013 and because I\u2019m a food geek, I got two from competing stalls, just to nitpick. Number one, from the English Indian, is encased in featherlight pakora batter and stayed nice and juicy though I\u2019m deducting points for the sweet chilli sauce because Kylie or not, it\u2019s not 1997. Opposite, Mr Hamid served his with pomegranate molasses and mint, which makes them definitely post-Ottolenghi, but the fries themselves were a bit overcooked and tough. Still feel pretty lucky, lucky, lucky though! Off to have a heart attack on the train home \u2013 see you next year! It\u2019s Sunday night, England have won the cricket, I\u2019ve been dozing most of the day (couldn\u2019t sleep last night: too hot, or I was buzzing too hard after watching the Killers on TV. You decide), but now I\u2019m here for five hours of watching the television with you. You can tweet me your observations: @michaelahann. Or you can just watch TV. At the moment, I\u2019ve got Billie Eilish on the iPlayer \u2013 her album is pretty great, so have a look. Though I accept that comparing her to Cole Porter in print, which I did, was perhaps pushing it. Thanks to everyone I spoke to for my tour of Glastonbury\u2019s fashion \u2013 we\u2019re ending on a high with Ian Kenton and his mankini. \u201cI got this from Amazon. There\u2019s been a lot of selfies. I had to get a bumbag because I have no pockets. The festival is one of the times I work really hard \u2013 we do the sound and light. We were all meant to wear outfits like this \u2013 but no one else got the memo.\u201d The narrative around Miley Cyrus has always been about how she picks up one sound \u2013 hip-hop, pure pop, gnarly authenticity \u2013 and then \u201crejects\u201d it as she moves on to the next thing. Her current styling is \u201chard rock karaoke at a gritty midwest bar\u201d, and she has her fair share of grungy belters, but her latest EP also features a fairly self-explanatory rap track called Catitude that she performs while crawling across the Pyramid stage, and that you imagine was written expressly in the hope of scoring a Drag Race sync. At this point in her mercurial, often controversial career, it\u2019s pretty clear that these things reflect the many multitudes of Miley, who stomps around the Pyramid stage in wet-look leather and a tiny skin-tight vest, yet spouts new-age wisdom (\u201cthe Killers fucking rocked and it scared the fuck out of me, but I ask the universe every day, show me something that scares the fuck out of me\u201d) and cries as she sings The Most, a song about her mum. The glorious thing about Miley is that she doesn\u2019t really make any sense, and her chaotic energy is the thing that binds it all together and keeps everyone goggling even when she makes moves that would traditionally result in shedding followers \u2013 the Pyramid field is packed, surprisingly. She covers Amy Winehouse and Dolly Parton, brings out her dad Billy Ray and rapper Lil Nas X for the latter\u2019s Old Town Road, and wears a lilac wig to play On a Roll, the \u201chit\u201d from the episode of Black Mirror where she plays ill-fated pop star Ashley O. Played half in its original synth-pop style, half as the Nine Inch Nails song it riffs on, it becomes a hard-rock battering ram yowled so mightily that she makes Steven Tyler sound like Aled Jones. As insane as it is brilliant. Miley Cyrus lets Lil Nas X do his new single Panini, which sadly isn\u2019t about the very bad mozzarella paninis you can buy over near the Other Stage. It\u2019s reminiscent of when Pharrell awkwardly played Move That Dope a couple of years back \u2013 the folding chair-toting masses aren\u2019t massively familiar with US rap bangers. It allows Miley a chance to change into a new outfit \u2013 of her Black Mirror character Ashley O \u2013 to perform On a Roll, which interpolates Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Head Like a Hole. She then reverts back to her earlier outfit to cover the original in full. And then does Wrecking Ball. A totally blockbuster ending. Another day, another bewilderingly massive singer-songwriter at the John Peel stage, though Tom Walker\u2019s syrupy sad-lad balladry couldn\u2019t be further from the chirpy folk of Gerry Cinnamon. That said, the Glaswegian by way of Manchester balladeer is a sensible fit for Sunday afternoon at Glastonbury, a time when the prospect of a return to stultifying normality is casting a deep pall over punters. Most are here to wallow in the gloom of Leave the Light On (241m listens and counting on Spotify), a maudlin but sincerely felt ballad about a friend\u2019s drug addiction. Walker is stronger when he sticks to this sort of lived experience \u2013 it\u2019s when he aims for state-of-the-nation stuff that things go badly wrong. \u201cThis is my middle finger in the air to the news,\u201d he says, introducing Dominoes, a muddled broadside against the mainstream media that feels like an unintended companion piece to David Brent\u2019s Equality Street. Miley Cyrus just played a cover of Jolene, by her godmother Dolly Parton, then rolled into Party In the USA, and then brought out her dad Billy Ray and Lil Nas X to do Old Town Road. Incredible scenes! Laura Snapes has done us a five-star review of Kylie\u2019s performance, concluding thus: \u201cThe showmanship, the incredible run of hits \u2013 it is absolutely phenomenal. So much so that the crowd keep bursting into chants of \u201cKylie! Kylie!\u201d and bringing her to tears. Never mind the legends slot; next stop, headliner.\u201d Loyle Carner is picking up the anti-Boris baton from Stormzy and running with it. He wore a T-shirt that read I Hate Boris, and ended his set by saying: \u201cMy name is Loyle Carner. Fuck Boris Johnson. Thank you!\u201d Miley Cyrus is giving the Pyramid stage a potty-mouthed pep talk. \u201cIn many ways, this show has changed my fucking life drastically, a lot of hard work, dedication and sacrifice,\u201d she tells the Pyramid stage crowd, adding that she saw the Killers last night on telly. \u201cThey fucking rocked, so it scared the shit out of me. You know what? I ask the universe every day: give me something that scares the fuck out of me, and I\u2019m going to fucking do it. So today, that\u2019s motherfucking Glastonbury.\u201d Here\u2019s the view from the \u2013 extremely large \u2013 crowd for Kylie. Miley Cyrus has taken to the Pyramid stage, and kicks off with Mark Ronson collabo Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, joined by Mark Ronson on guitar. With wet-look trousers and cap plus a vast Chanel pendant, the look is very much \u201craunchy traffic cop\u201d. Miley\u2019s, not Mark\u2019s. Ashuvini Mahendraun: \u201cI like catsuits \u2013 I have three with me for this trip. They\u2019re really good for hot weather. I go to a lot of festivals - I went to Primavera earlier this year \u2013 but I don\u2019t wear these kinds of things at other festivals. It\u2019s more T-shirt and shorts. At Glastonbury everyone is a bit more out there.\u201d Fat White Family look like they\u2019ve been at Glastonbury since at least last Tuesday when they take the stage at the Park, but then Fat White Family always look like that: sleazy but chic. Like all the best bands, they give the impression of being fellow reprobates well met, the last gang in town. Easing themselves into their set like they\u2019re easing themselves into a spandex trouser suit, they slowly pick up the pace and by the time they hit Feet, the crowd squinting through the late afternoon haze are firmly into their stride too. One of the singalong moments of the festival comes with the chorus of one of their big tunes, Touch the Leather. It might make more sense to see them in the small hours in Shangri-La, but anyone who has got lost en route to or from Kylie and ended up here by mistake will be taking away some kind of strange but important life lessons. Eve Lazarus: \u201cThese leggings are from Puckoo Couture, a Bristol designer, and I got the earrings from a market stall. The rest of it is Pretty Little Thing, I got told at the last minute I had to wear green. I usually wear a lot more colour and when I am not wearing colour, I don\u2019t feel like myself. Amy Winehouse said the same thing about her beehive.\u201d Met with equal parts bafflement and joy over on the Other stage, it\u2019s kawaii metal group Babymetal! Here\u2019s another shot of Kylie and Nick Cave. *Screams in gothic* This is a fantastically buoyant and brilliant performance by Kylie, and clearly an emotional one after she had to pull out in 2005 following a breast cancer diagnosis. Chris Martin covered Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head that year with Coldplay, and so there was a poignant edge to his guest appearance today. All weekend Hannah Jane Parkinson has been looking at how Glastonbury is addressing the climate emergency. Kylie update: she\u2019s had another costume change and is now wearing a gold glittery number while rattling through Better the Devil You Know. The angular-haired pop-metal posers have upped their game since they played Glastonbury\u2019s Other stage three years ago. They are by now Britain\u2019s biggest metal band, as well as the festival\u2019s token heavy main stagers. Their show is arena-sized, with a catwalk along the back for them to grind their axes along and Janet Jackson-rivalling dancers, who mosh around the musicians, and a song in which they appear to duet with the film character The Crow, who looms on the visuals behind. But though they have the heaviness to reign supreme in the metal world, they also have an appealing commercial edge, straying into EDM at points. As such they seem seem stuck between the two realms, perhaps condemned to the Other stage for life. Their show, with the bombast of Queen, is a spectacle at least. Maybe next year the Pyramid could be theirs. Another special guest over on the Pyramid: Chris Martin has joined Kylie\u2019s backing band, strumming away on an acoustic guitar for I Just Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head! The Coldplay star appeared with Stormzy during the grime star\u2019s Friday Pyramid headline set. Ben Beaumont-Thomas just watched Jeff Goldblum charm the pants off the West Holts and had a fun time, even if the Jurassic Park star\u2019s ivory-tinkering left something to be desired: Goldblum himself plays the piano like a man driving an unfamiliar hire car away from an airport, peering at his sheet music and poking experimentally at chords. But he is game enough to admit his own frailties. \u201cI\u2019m known for the glissando,\u201d he says wryly; he relies on cascading note runs, one-note solos and vamping chords rather than virtuosity. But his magnetism is its own instrument. As his band close out with the Jurassic Park theme, the crowd at the West Holts stage has swelled massively, everyone basking in a beam of starlight. Flags. Glasto\u2019s got a ton of them. Plenty are bad but some are worth your attention. Here are a few of our faves from this year: As widely hoped, Nick Cave has joined Kylie for the pair\u2019s sensual and dark duet, Where the Wild Roses Grow. The pair enjoy a light canoodle midway through. Phwoar! Within about five minutes Kylie has declared herself speechless, brought out a Klaus Nomi lookalike and is already on to her second costume change - from silky white trousers to a ritzy red dress. Time for another of our artist Q&amp;As. This time it\u2019s multi-instrumentalist Georgia, who tells Kate Hutchinson about coming to Glastonbury aged seven (her dad was in Left Field!) and a close encounter at this year\u2019s fest with a Love Islander: NYC Downlow, Glastonbury\u2019s venerable gay club, has been commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots at this year\u2019s festival. Alex Needham spoke to its creators about what they had in store, including \u2013 rather wonderfully \u2013 a communal listen to Somewhere Over the Rainbow: Judging from the hearty roar we just heard in the Guardian Glasto office, Kylie has emerged on the Pyramid stage. In previous years, grime and UK rap has often been confined to a particular corner of Glastonbury. This year, it\u2019s joyful (and pretty tiring on the legs) to discover that there\u2019s a huge variety of rap artists spread across the whole site. There\u2019s scarcely a stage that hasn\u2019t seen a moshpit this weekend \u2013 yesterday Slowthai was demanding his crowd create the biggest of the festival at West Holts, and today Octavian was insisting that his at John Peel had to be even bigger. But perhaps unlike other rappers on the bill, Octavian\u2019s dreamlike music isn\u2019t always the most obviously mosh-able. Drenched in acid trip-emulating cartoon visuals and delivering elegiac auto-tuned vocals over skippy beats, Octavian\u2019s mid-afternoon set had a \u201cheartbroken in the rave\u201d vibe. At one point, he announced that he broke up with his girlfriend last week, and got everyone in the crowd who\u2019s going through a break-up to give a mournful cheer. His vocals shone on sad bangers from his most recent mixtape, Endorphins, but the true highlights of the set were his off-kilter breakthrough hit Party Here (including his lithe, wiry footwork) and the boisterous Skepta-featuring single Bet \u2013 a song so infectious that even the security staff were spotted skanking. Oh. Dear. Freed from the shackles of indie also-rans Slow Club, Rebecca Taylor is now known as Self Esteem, and specialises in emotionally lacerating DIY pop. If in her previous life she was in the shadows, here she\u2019s gloriously front and centre, rolling through tight choreography with her two backing singers while wearing a sequinned bra and an oversized lilac suit. Steady I Stand, like most of the songs on debut Compliments Please, starts small before morphing into an anthemic chorus skyrocketed by Taylor\u2019s swollen vocals. Girl Crush, meanwhile, is a 60s girl-group bop updated for 2019 complete with choreographed handclaps, while the urgent In Time (\u201cI\u2019m going to get drunk and slag you off then go home and eat my feelings\u201d) morphs hip-hop\u2019s booming beats into something endearingly lo-fi. A sweaty set ends with The Best, a throbbing electro stomper revolving around the chorus: \u201cI did the best that I could babe.\u201d You did more than that, if anything. Ocean Wisdom is a man of firsts: he\u2019s the first rapper to dethrone Eminem as the fastest MC in the world and he\u2019s possibly the first rapper to get his name from a 90s indie band. He tells a story about how his parents came to Glastonbury in 1992 and liked Ocean Colour Scene so much that they gave their son the same name. Ocean\u2019s sound throws the old-school back to the future. He raps like a cross between a junglist MC and Busta Rhymes, over beats that hark back to the golden era of UK hip-hop (think Roots Manuva), drum\u2019n\u2019bass and Boy Better Know-era grime instrumentals. But while the tunes are decent and he\u2019s drawn a large crowd to Sonic stage, his rapid-fire delivery can come off, at times, as jibberish wibbling away over a party track. And while he brings on a hype man to help out, he lacks stage presence of some of his peers (he shouts out Stormzy) \u2013 his set comes off a little like People Just Do Nothing. It\u2019s a promising debut at Glasto, but there\u2019s work to do before he gets anywhere near the Pyramid stage. Time for another of our occasional catch-ups with the stars performing at this year\u2019s festival. George Ezra spoke to Jenny Stevens about how nice his tent is and why he\u2019s not ready to headline Glasto just yet: Environmental protests, blunts in the air, roots reggae chirruping over the park: its almost as if it\u2019s 1970, except that Koffee is completely of her time. The young Jamaican star brings playful, combative rap energy and nifty electronic sheen to her debut Glastonbury performance, unspooling her wickedly tangled flow so vigorously that she appears to vibrate, a wiry thing in sleek black Nike. Her revolutionary spirit is also totally of her generation, not focusing on governments and politics but existential stresses: in Jamaica, she tells us, obstacles in life are known as pressure, the name of a song that has the same sense of lived-in stress as anything off Rihanna\u2019s Anti. \u201cWe all have to make it, she insists in a laid-back acoustic number that she describes as \u201ca cry for the youth\u201d. She has songs for their triumphs, too: Blessings shimmers with joy, as does Koffee when the crowd sing every word back at her. Another career-making Glastonbury performance. And here is our report of David Attenborough\u2019s appearance on the Pyramid stage, with some more detail on Glastonbury\u2019s plastic-free initiative: Over on the West Holts stage Ben Beaumont-Thomas is watching Jeff Goldblum\u2019s jazz set. He\u2019s not even started yet and he\u2019s already killing it, it seems: Jeff Goldblum is just doing his soundcheck and he already has the crowd in the palm of his hand: he\u2019s fielded questions on his zebra trousers, flirted outrageously with Kate the TV runner, and sung La Marseilleise. His mic gets cut off ahead of the performance \u2013 the crowd respond with boos, then chants of \u201cwe want Jeff!\u201d, and then the Jurassic Park theme. Banter levels are already dangerously spiking. Laura Snapes was at the Pyramid for David Attenborough\u2019s rockstar appearance, and here are her first impressions: There\u2019s almost a Corbyn-sized crowd assembled for David Attenborough, but where the atmosphere for the Labour leader was one of punk community, the vibe today is more reverent \u2013 a moment of respect for the nature we\u2019re losing thanks to human destruction, for sure, but also for Attenborough, this single-minded constant in everyone present\u2019s lives, from the infants to the elderly. His speech is brief but powerful, highlighting humankind\u2019s relative insignificance in comparison to its massive footprint, and the comparatively little effort \u2013 \u00e0 la Glastonbury\u2019s plastic-free initiative \u2013 it takes to make a difference. Here\u2019s the trailer for One Planet: Seven Worlds for those at home. Attenborough announces One Planet: Seven Worlds, a new BBC TV series aimed at fighting climate change. And now we have a trailer from the programme. And with that he\u2019s off! A short but sweet appearance from the broadcasting veteran. Attenborough is talking about Blue Planet 2 and the scene where the damage done by plastic to the ocean was starkly shown. He thanks Glastonbury for removing all plastic from the festival and the attendees for using less plastic themselves. In voiceover David Attenborough asks the assembled to \u201clisten to the songs of the ocean depths\u201d, followed by some rather soothing whale noises. A huge roar greets his arrival to the stage. Shades of Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 here. Opening with a snippet of portentous dialogue from Dame Judi Dench and a burst of glittery ticker tape feels like the perfect encapsulation of Years and Years\u2019 highfalutin\u2019 but banger-loaded synth-pop. This is also pop music with a message. The opening Sanctify, about frontman Olly Alexander\u2019s toxic liaisons with straight men, is augmented by messages from trolls such as \u201cWhy does he have to be so gay?\u201d and \u201cAnybody cringe at the gayness?\u201d flashing up on the screens. That the song\u2019s central lyric is \u201cI won\u2019t be ashamed\u201d says it all. From there it\u2019s a quick sprint through the undeniable Shine and recent album Paolo Alto\u2019s highlight Karma, Alexander slinking around the stage in what looks like a tartan S&amp;M two piece complete with LOVE choker. When the jacket comes off to leave a mesh vest and bare chest before gay sex anthem Meteorite, the crowd whoop in approval. \u201cAhh thanks,\u201d Alexander laughs, his euphoria at being a pop star palpable. Later he\u2019ll suggest he wants to bathe everyone, before a lovely piano-led Eyes Shut causes an outbreak of swaying. Then he announces his loosely buttoned trousers are about to come off before a suitably sultry Desire. Just as the song is hitting its groove, a siren rings out, the beat disintegrates and dancers rush the stage as stats flash up on the screens. \u201cHomosexuality is illegal in 72 countries\u201d one reads, before the show ends with \u201cQueer is beautiful\u201d and Alexander snogs a male dancer to vast cheers. He then gives a very emotional speech, peppered with tears, about everyone working together to change the future for LGBTQ+ people. If a good Glastonbury performance is about seizing your moment then this is that in excelsis. There\u2019s always been an admirably activist edge to the shimmering pop of Years and Years, and during their Pyramid Stage set they took over the big screens to broadcast damning facts about the prejudice faced by the LGBTQ community both at home and abroad. Lots of people mentioning the Authentic Lebanese Mezze stall in the Park Area (which also happens to be next to the place I got my second breakfast, but I have moved since I promise). Haven\u2019t spotted a lot of Middle Eastern stuff here, certainly not in comparison to Mexican and Indian, so I was looking forward to this. The best bit was definitely the spinach and feta fatayer pastry, which was unusually spinach-heavy, and the hummus and baba ganoush \u2013 but again, had to get out my trusty tin of salt as it all lacked for a bit of oomph. Doing a roaring trade though so clearly Glastonbury disagrees. The Guardian\u2019s Alex Needham had a quick chat with Smiths ledge Johnny Marr about this year\u2019s Glasto heatwave, the festival\u2019s political element and his memories of seeing Zep at Knebworth. Read the whole interview here: The rumour that Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper would play a secret A Star Is Born set at Glastonbury may have been promptly scotched by Emily Eavis, but there\u2019s another multi-hyphenate performing hits from her own musical drama in their absence. Irish actor Jessie Buckley starred last year in Wild Rose, a charming Brit drama about a Glasgow girl\u2019s attempts to break into the Nashville country music scene. It was a premise bolstered by the fact that Buckley has the lovelorn voice of a Broadway veteran, as she proved here. A barnstorming, belted-out cover of Randy Newman\u2019s Guilty is the highlight, but there\u2019s also a chiming cover of Emmylou Harris\u2019s Born to Run too. \u201cThis is fucking insane \u2013 I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she yelps at one point, a line it\u2019s difficult to imagine Gaga ever delivering, but on this evidence Buckley is every bit at home here as the Hollywood heavyweights. Hi, Gwilym Mumford here, taking over liveblog duties for the next few hours. We\u2019ve got Kylie, Miley and a certain D Attenborough coming shortly. Stay with us! Situated in the Greenpeace field near a skate park and a 20ft rave tree lives BEAM, a site-specific wooden sculpture by Wolfgang Buttress that aims to highlight the plight of bees in the wake of the climate crisis. \u201cBEAM is a conversation and symphony between the insect world and us,\u201d Buttress explains, with the centre of the vast wooden structure a \u2013 wait for it \u2013 hive of soundscapes and flashing lights triggered by a live feed from Worthy Farm\u2019s bee colony. \u201cThese live signals are sent to the sculpture via a dedicated internet link,\u201d continues Buttress. \u201c[The] algorithms will be used to convert these vibrational signals into lighting and sound effects, enabling the life of the black bee colony to be visually and aurally felt as a live experience. No two moments will ever be the same.\u201d If the sound of bees pushed through an ambient filter sounds a bit one-note, then the drones have also been augmented by musicians including Spiritualized, Kelly Owens, Camille Christel, Matt Black and Coldcut. As with most things in Glastonbury, its uses are multipurpose: some are using the central space to do yoga or just escape for a bit, while the giant wooden struts that surround it act as a makeshift maze to get lost in. It\u2019s also not going anywhere. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Michael Eavis will keep BEAM as a living bee hotel on his farm so it can be reimagined for Glastonbury,\u201d Buttress says. As the Beat Hotel retires, the bee hotel buzzes to life. Lauren Cochrane has been out and about snapping the most stylish looks in the field. Alice Fry, 28, social media executive \u201cCycling shorts \u2013 it\u2019s just the look everyone is going for, isn\u2019t it? I guess it\u2019s born from Kylie Jenner and those people. I showed this to my friend who is really fashion-forward and she loved it. It\u2019s Glastonbury so anything goes. Stormzy was a highlight \u2013 I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in what he says.\u201d Heather Doughy, 26, PR \u201cOur group has a different outfit theme every day \u2013 this time it\u2019s sexy sweetcorn, a really niche reference from an obscure musical. We also have a Billie Eilish lyric and Disco Needs You for Kylie on Sunday. This is the third time I have been. It\u2019s special because everyone is super-kind. We\u2019re a big LGBT group and everyone feels safe here.\u201d Laura Rietdyk-Johnson, 26, works in social media \u201cI am volunteering for Oxfam \u2013 usually I have a faceful of glitter. Glastonbury really inspires me to be who I want to be. I have a different look for each day \u2013 on Saturday, I was in all green. I plan what I am going to wear for months.\u201d From the spiritual awakening of Langa Methodist Church Choir to a social awakening. Anyone can spout empty bromides about peace and love from a stage, but 79-year-old Mavis Staples gives hers real meaning and power in this absolutely magnificent Pyramid stage set. Delivered in a throaty holler, her songs about love and social justice are full of simple, digestible, but poetic truths: \u201cWhat good is freedom if we haven\u2019t learned to be free?\u201d she asks early on. These open-hearted questions harden and galvanise on Who Told You That: \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna rock the boat \u2013 who told you that?\u201d she asks, brilliantly sly and lupine. Via classic 12-bar electric blues and a cover of activist anthem For What It\u2019s Worth by Buffalo Springfield, she warms her heart back up, imploring the crowd in a glorious, ferocious yell to \u201ctouch somebody!\u201d English reserve melts as strangers gingerly reach out to each other. She ends by castigating \u201cthat \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to call it \u2013 that one in the White House\u201d, pleading for gun reform and an end to the imprisonment of migrant children at the US border. \u201cI might just run for president!\u201d she decides. She has 10,000 or votes secured here already. Writer and activist Reni Eddo-Lodge made very clear at the beginning of Left Field\u2019s banner debate this afternoon that the panelists would not be discussing \u201cwhy racism is bad\u201d. The speakers \u2013 Matthew Collins from Hope Not Hate, Faiza Shaheen from the think tank Class, Sheffield\u2019s enigmatic Lord Mayor, Majid, and Amos Schonfeld, founder of youth movement Our Second Home \u2013 have done enough of that in the past. Instead, this discussion was geared towards action and solutions, exploring what resistance means in an age when far-right ideology is becoming ever more mainstream. On banning or no-platforming as a tactic for fighting back, Majid spoke on his headline-grabbing move to ban Donald Trump from the city of Sheffield during a state visit: \u201cYes, America are our friends, but when my friend\u2019s being a prick I say, \u2018Mate, get your shit together.\u2019\u201d Others spoke on the importance of compassion and celebrating difference. Shaheen, who is standing against Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford in the next general election, partly as a protest against his \u201cincredibly cruel\u201d welfare reforms, said that she had found herself redressing her assumptions about people when doorstepping Ukip voters, and finding them open to changing their minds. \u201cJust in having that conversation, and being humanised \u2026 You\u2019d be surprised by how far you can engage with some people.\u201d The most important point iterated by each panelist, though, was a need to challenge hateful rhetoric wherever and whenever we see it, even if that means responding to \u201cendless abuse, diet tips and death threats\u201d on Twitter, as it does for activist Matt Collins. \u201cWe have to stand up for what we believe.\u201d For Majid, just being visible and consistently true to his core beliefs is a way of fighting hate. When his appointment as mayor instigated abuse, he says: \u201cI suddenly realised my mere existence was a form of resistance.\u201d Despite facing racist hate mail, he refused to tone down his politics. \u201cI\u2019m a black Muslim refugee immigrant \u2013 how can I not be political? If you\u2019re trying to be anyone\u2019s cup of tea, you might as well be a mug.\u201d If Glastonbury needed a wake up call on its last day then Finland\u2019s Alma is here to deliver it: her brand of brash agit-pop, delivered in a throat-lacerating roar, could resuscitate the dead. \u201cDance, fucking dance,\u201d she sings within the first two minutes, prowling the stage like an off duty Cyberdog employee \u2013 all lime green hair, matching silk shirt and skull jewellery. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy for being awake this early,\u201d she says correctly, before she performs the pulsating Cowboy and a giant picture of her with two middle fingers raised flashes up on the screen. At times the angst feels a little forced \u2013 the appropriately named Good Vibes is too buoyant to be delivered angrily \u2013 but the congregation of young girls in the front row can\u2019t get enough. It\u2019s also perfect pop for a genre-agnostic new generation with the self-aggrandising Legend fusing hip-hop and big crunchy rock guitars, while EDM drops are sprinkled throughout M\u00d8 collaboration Dance Wiv Me. If occasionally on record it can veer a little too close to generic radio fodder \u2013 and there\u2019s still a sense that she\u2019s scrambling for a hit \u2013 in a live scenario it\u2019s emboldened by Alma\u2019s untiring stage presence. Cas, 54, and Sue, 60 Sue: \u201cThis is a once in a lifetime experience \u2013 I\u2019ve wanted to come forever and luckily a mate got tickets at the last minute. I\u2019m celebrating my 60th birthday this year and I can\u2019t think of anything better than being at the front for Kylie. It\u2019s sad that she had to cancel her last performance here because she was ill so it\u2019ll be emotional having her back \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to dance along with her.\u201d Gemma, 34 \u201cKylie\u2019s been my idol since I was really young \u2013 I used to dress like her when we had mufti days at school! This is my first Glastonbury and I just can\u2019t believe my luck that she\u2019s playing \u2013 I want to get as close as possible. I love everything about her.\u201d Joanne, 35 \u201cKylie just doesn\u2019t do bad tunes, does she? She\u2019s a true legend and I want to be front and centre when she\u2019s on. There\u2019s something so special about being at the front of the Pyramid Stage \u2013 last time I saw the Jacksons and shed a tear, so I\u2019m sure Kylie will be just as special.\u201d Michelle, 53, Shona, 44 Michelle: \u201cWe\u2019ve come all the way from Australia for Glastonbury and it\u2019s amazing that Kylie\u2019s playing. I\u2019ve seen her three times and each time she\u2019s totally smashed it. I once did a Kylie flash mob at the Royal Opera House in Sydney. How amazing that she\u2019s come back to perform after she cancelled because she was ill before \u2013 she\u2019s going to get all the love she needs from us and this crowd.\u201d Luke, 25 \u201cI just don\u2019t want to go home \u2013 everyone\u2019s feeling the blues today so I\u2019m really excited to dance to Kylie, it\u2019ll be a massive pick-me-up. She\u2019s got such a great back catalogue of fun bangers \u2013 her performance is going to keep me going through the next week when I\u2019m back home and just want to be back here.\u201d Anyone stumbling back to their tent after an all-nighter at the stone circle must have thought they were experiencing a divine intervention: the sound of beautiful choral music spilling across the Pyramid stage field. It\u2019s emanating from Langa Methodist Church Choir, a Cape Town choir that the Eavises met during a charity trip and subsequently invited to play this year\u2019s festival \u2013 a serious logistical undertaking involving dozens of artist visas and the kind of effort that very few other festivals would make. Their songs, which ask God to see them and not leave them stranded \u2013 sentiments that will no doubt chime with plenty of hungover festivalgoers \u2013 swell and rise to the back of the field. Dressed in black robes with beautiful detailing like green lipstick and beaded headpieces, they\u2019re accompanied by a single hand drum, which gives these devotionals heft and swaying rhythm. This hit of absolute beauty spiritually realigns the entire site \u2013 leaving it ready to be undone again for one last time tonight. \u201cHad a mooch round the Healing Fields and then decided the most healing thing I could do for myself was to get a vegan masala chai and raw brownie from the cafe at the entrance to the tipi fields and go and lie in a hammock for a bit. Correct decision: the brownie was good, especially for something with no butter in it \u2013 very fudgy and fruity with a decent sprinkling of nuts \u2013 and the chai nicely spiced and not too sweet. They look like they take their coffee pretty seriously too.\u201d One from last night: Earlier on Saturday, Liam Gallagher referred to his set as part of his \u201congoing Glastonbury residency\u201d. Headlining the Other stage, the Chemical Brothers could easily make a similar claim. For anyone who grew up watching Glastonbury on TV, the sound of Hey Boy, Hey Girl throbbing across montages of Worthy Farm is a familiar one. So there\u2019s a built-in nostalgia to their set, amplified by the dusky sky, the constant smoky pop of flares being lit and a high density of Glastonbury\u2019s iconic flags \u2013 but not to the degree that the crowd are twiddling their thumbs waiting for the hits. The material from new album No Geography is just as joyfully chaotic as the stuff from their heyday \u2013 chemical explosions of bright synths girded by twisted robot yowls. They pull off bold, breathless transitions, from ravey sirens that bark like an orchestra of seals into sharply overdriven, twinkly brightness, the effect akin to being dropped off a cliff. Saturate, from 2007\u2019s We Are the Night, is luscious and overwhelming, a powerful jazz drumbeat thrashing amid its hopeful ascending synths. With Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons ensconced in a flight deck\u2019s worth of synths, the visuals transmit the playfulness at the heart of their music \u2013 a new song, Got to Keep On, has the best of the lot, a kind of silky pink Michelin man made of petals swaggering along a treadmill. Nothing, obviously, is as visceral as their admirably spare deployment of the hits: they tease Hey Boy, Hey Girl with a flirty intro, then trigger that roiling beat and helter-skelter cry \u2013 \u201cHere we go!\u201d; Galvanise still sounds regally intimidating. It\u2019s easy to overlook the Chems as their hipper, more avant-garde successors take over \u2013 as they should \u2013 but in their spiritual home, they prove why they\u2019ll always be Britain\u2019s beloved rave dads. Tara Asher Tara Asher went viral this weekend for her BSL interpretation of Stormzy\u2019s headline slot. Speaking to the Guardian before the set, she explained how being a lifelong grime fan prepared her for the show: \u201cSign language is my first language \u2013 I\u2019ve got family members who are deaf. But I never even considered going into [interpreting music] until going to a couple of festivals with my deaf friends, and then I saw the need for it. There\u2019s not many interpreters who interpret music and do festivals, there\u2019s a shortage nationally. Not all deaf people are into music, there are some who are and some who aren\u2019t, the same way that not every single hearing person wants to go to a music festival. I know that a couple of Stormzy\u2019s biggest deaf fans are here, so it\u2019s really nice to know that they\u2019re going to get a wonderful experience. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to grime music since the Risky Roadz days, since the very beginning, so it\u2019s easier for me, because I understand the context, the slang, all that stuff. Yes, grime is often faster, but sometimes you may get a rock song that\u2019s very difficult to convey in sign language. But each to their own. I like to stick with grime.\u201d Benjamin Gorman DeafZone volunteer Benajmin Gorman is the first deaf BSL interpreter to work at Glastonbury. On Friday, he interpreted Bastille\u2019s Pyramid stage set for a deaf audience. He told the Guardian: \u201cGlastonbury is a fantastic music festival, but it\u2019s not just about the music; it\u2019s about the atmosphere, it\u2019s about the camaraderie, and also the lovely food we\u2019re surrounded by, and the bit too much sun we\u2019re experiencing. Festivals aren\u2019t always just about the music, it\u2019s about the overall experience of being part and parcel of the festival, and [interpreting is] about a deaf person being able to take part in that. There are various levels of hearing a person might have. Some deaf people have some residual hearing and can hear quite well; some have no residual hearing but they can experience music through vibrations. Also, the atmosphere really makes you connect with the acts and the artists. So a festival is an experience in itself. \u201cThe important thing is access. For deaf people, they deserve to have the same experience as anybody else who pays for a ticket to go to a festival. For myself, I think we need to show that deaf people are capable of [interpreting] as well.\u201d Good morning from the blessedly cool Guardian cabin where constitutions are slightly fragile but morale remains high. On a scale of \u201cStone circle dweller\u201d to \u201cBrandon Flowers on the main stage\u201d, our appearances may hew closer to the former, but we\u2019re doing our best to bring some of the Killers\u2019 Vegas razzle-dazzle to today\u2019s liveblog. Before that kicks off in earnest, let\u2019s revisit their five-star performance \u2013 with its guest spots from Pet Shop Boys and Johnny Marr \u2013 which Alexis Petridis declared a bona fide Glastonbury Moment.",

He ruefully quotes a line about suspecting that \u201cyou\u2019re shitter than your parents at being a parent\u201d. Can he ever transmit as clean a set of values as they did? \u201cI am a lot more compromised as a person than either of them.

She is pure of heart, my sister.\u201d</p> <p>Even the Thornes feel the strain of these trying political times. \u201cFor the first time we haven\u2019t discussed how we all voted in the European elections. I think we\u2019re all exhausted by it.\u201d Despite a final act set in 2017, \u201cthe B-word is mentioned only once. Brexit is a symptom of a country that\u2019s got itself into a malaise and this play is about that malaise.\u201d</p> <p>How do Thorne\u2019s parents feel about his work? He scrunches up. \u201cI think they are proud of bits of it \u2013 and then there are other bits where they would question it. They saw a film I wrote and went, \u2018What happened?\u2019 [in terms of his involvement]. I quite like that they\u2019re so honest.\u201d But honesty is hard. \u201cI feel the judgment constantly.

I wouldn\u2019t have been able to cope with the rejection.\u201d If he couldn\u2019t work on it, Tiffany interrupts, there would be pragmatic reasons. \u201cI know,\u201d Thorne answers, nine times in rapid succession. \u201cBut this one\u2019s very personal to me \u2013 so the fact that it\u2019s being directed by him is really important to me.\u201d</p> <p>Tiffany\u2019s productions (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jun/25/theatre.reviews1\">Black Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/08/the-glass-menagerie-at-edinburgh-festival-review-tennessee-williams-john-tiffany\">The Glass Menagerie</a>) are notably dynamic, and here, too, he drafted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/06/black-watch-harry-potter-edinburgh-festival-john-tiffany-steven-hoggett-the-glass-menagerie-tennessee-williams\">Steven Hoggett</a>, his long-term movement collaborator. \u201cAll the frou-frou \u2013 we always call it frou-frou \u2013 goes into the decade jumps. There isn\u2019t one moment where all the characters sit round the table \u2013 the second it\u2019s about to happen, someone moves.\u201d</p> <p>Their last Royal Court collaboration was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/03/hope-jack-thorne-royal-court-review\">Hope</a> \u2013 but wasn\u2019t there some little project after that? Oh yes, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, still storming London and Broadway. Thorne\u2019s rollicking text, astonishingly for a play script, teleported to the top of the bestseller charts. So, did the show change their lives? Tiffany considers. \u201cIt marked the climax of something we\u2019d been working towards as a group of people for 20-odd years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe amount of people that see it is gorgeous, and of course it gives a bit of freedom, financially. And creatively, just because it worked.\u201d</p> <p>In retrospect, that success seems inevitable \u2013 but Tiffany recalls widespread public doubts that it could satisfy fervid fan expectation. \u201cI never allowed us to think about it.\u201d That, Thorne explains, is the director\u2019s characteristic response. \u201cI would have let it overwhelm me. But we were all on the John train and the John train was just going.\u201d Is the John train always positive? \u201cAlways,\u201d Thorne says several times. He laughs, then asks: \u201cWhen have I ever been the positive force in our relationship? You\u2019re the warrior and I\u2019m the worrier.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, back to this play, and its two most crucial audience members. \u201cI\u2019m very nervous about what my parents will think,\u201d Thorne says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t read it, but they know it\u2019s about them \u2013 they\u2019re coming with all their mates. I feel their impending arrival now.\u201d I dread to think what this will do to him. \u201cI\u2019m literally not in the country! So that\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The End of History is at the <a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/theendofhistory/\">Royal Court, London</a>, until 10 August</p></li> </ul>",

That idea of \u2018What are you doing for the world today?\u2019 is something that still haunts me.\u201d Thorne and Tiffany first met more than 20 years ago, and have since collaborated on wizards and vampires \u2013 but Thorne submitted this script to the Royal Court rather than direct to Tiffany. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put our friendship under that test. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to cope with the rejection.\u201d If he couldn\u2019t work on it, Tiffany interrupts, there would be pragmatic reasons. \u201cI know,\u201d Thorne answers, nine times in rapid succession. \u201cBut this one\u2019s very personal to me \u2013 so the fact that it\u2019s being directed by him is really important to me.\u201d Tiffany\u2019s productions (Black Watch, The Glass Menagerie) are notably dynamic, and here, too, he drafted in Steven Hoggett, his long-term movement collaborator. \u201cAll the frou-frou \u2013 we always call it frou-frou \u2013 goes into the decade jumps. There isn\u2019t one moment where all the characters sit round the table \u2013 the second it\u2019s about to happen, someone moves.\u201d Their last Royal Court collaboration was Hope \u2013 but wasn\u2019t there some little project after that? Oh yes, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, still storming London and Broadway. Thorne\u2019s rollicking text, astonishingly for a play script, teleported to the top of the bestseller charts. So, did the show change their lives? Tiffany considers. \u201cIt marked the climax of something we\u2019d been working towards as a group of people for 20-odd years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe amount of people that see it is gorgeous, and of course it gives a bit of freedom, financially. And creatively, just because it worked.\u201d In retrospect, that success seems inevitable \u2013 but Tiffany recalls widespread public doubts that it could satisfy fervid fan expectation. \u201cI never allowed us to think about it.\u201d That, Thorne explains, is the director\u2019s characteristic response. \u201cI would have let it overwhelm me. But we were all on the John train and the John train was just going.\u201d Is the John train always positive? \u201cAlways,\u201d Thorne says several times. He laughs, then asks: \u201cWhen have I ever been the positive force in our relationship? You\u2019re the warrior and I\u2019m the worrier.\u201d Meanwhile, back to this play, and its two most crucial audience members. \u201cI\u2019m very nervous about what my parents will think,\u201d Thorne says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t read it, but they know it\u2019s about them \u2013 they\u2019re coming with all their mates. I feel their impending arrival now.\u201d I dread to think what this will do to him. \u201cI\u2019m literally not in the country! So that\u2019s good.\u201d The End of History is at the Royal Court, London, until 10 August",

      "body": "<p>John McEnroe\u2019s father, finding himself powerless to curb his son\u2019s temper, at least prevailed upon him never to swear on court. That advice, McEnroe explained, produced those violent, weirdly prim outbursts that always made him sound like a supply teacher in meltdown: \u201cYou canNOT be serious!\u201d It is clear from the start of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006hn8\">John McEnroe: Still Rockin\u2019 at 60</a> (BBC One) that this line still haunts the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujD4nUS4UuU\">three-time Wimbledon singles champion</a>. It is also clear that he doesn\u2019t really mind. He repeats it himself, often, whenever he thinks it will serve as a punchline.</p> <p>On the eve of Wimbledon fortnight, Sue Barker went to meet one of the tournament\u2019s best-loved \u2013 in retrospect, at least \u2013 players, to let him reminisce about his life and career. It is not quite a hagiography \u2013 you would be hard-pressed to make McEnroe look like a saint \u2013 but it is still a bit of a victory lap, for a man who appears in every respect to deserve one.</p> <p>McEnroe grew up in Douglaston, an upmarket bit of Queens that happened to have its own tennis club, of which he was the undisputed star. He was 18, and still an amateur, when on a whim he and Mary Carillo, a friend from Douglaston, entered the French Open mixed doubles. They won the title. That summer, he reached the Wimbledon singles semi-finals.</p> <p>Back then, he looked like a child actor hired to play a tennis brat: knit brows, pouting lower lip, wild curls pinched in a headband. Although he was vilified for the outbursts he directed at officials, he remained at all times unapologetic. \u201cWhen people look back in 10 years, they\u2019re gonna thank me for improving the level of officiating,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Reflecting on those days, a white-haired McEnroe recalls the pressure he was under from his parents, who expected only the best from him. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you feel like, no matter what you do, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d he says. His behaviour left him isolated in the tour changing rooms, but even now he maintains he was always right about the bad calls.</p> <p>Eventually, he earned enough respect from rivals such as Bj\u00f6rn Borg to gain acceptance, and he settled down enough to enjoy an era where professional players could still combine world-class tennis with a rock\u2019n\u2019roll lifestyle. \u201cIn our day, we took performance-detracting drugs,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It is difficult to pinpoint the moment when McEnroe was transformed from reviled tantrum-thrower to imported national treasure. It is as if one day he went into the wilderness and returned with a sense of humour about everything. He is as brash and unapologetic as he ever was, but there is a gentle self-mockery behind it all, not to mention a great deal of insight. It is almost impossible not to like him.</p> <p>Today, he is a man of varied and competing passions. He takes Barker to his New York art gallery, where he fishes through a deep, dark cupboard in search of a ladder. \u201cThis is where the Warhol of me and my ex-wife resides,\u201d he says. He still maintains his lifelong love affair with rock\u2019n\u2019roll, although it would be hard to find charitable things to say about his singing. One of his daughters insists he was a pretty good guitar player, but the BBC is not able to provide any evidence of this.</p> <p>McEnroe at 60, although reflective, is hardly a man on the brink of retirement: he is a full-time tennis commentator when he is not running his New York tennis academy. And he still plays the game \u2013 the oldest guy on the senior tour, and possibly the fittest.</p> <p>Above all, McEnroe comes across as a man sustained by relationships, with family, friends, partners and rivals. They are all here, armed with anecdotes: Borg, Chrissie Hynde (\u201cWhen he would come to London, he\u2019d always give me a call,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew it\u2019s \u2019cos he thought I might have some pot\u201d), his wife of 25 years, his kids, his two brothers. Everybody, it seems, has a good word to say about him.</p> <p>The exception, perhaps, is arch-rival Jimmy Connors, very much the Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film of the evening. But, in his absence, we get McEnroe on Connors: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another player on Earth I have more respect for, in terms of what he brought to the table,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s also one of the biggest A-holes that ever lived. But so am I.\u201d Careful not to swear, as ever.</p>",

That summer, he reached the Wimbledon singles semi-finals. Back then, he looked like a child actor hired to play a tennis brat: knit brows, pouting lower lip, wild curls pinched in a headband. Although he was vilified for the outbursts he directed at officials, he remained at all times unapologetic. \u201cWhen people look back in 10 years, they\u2019re gonna thank me for improving the level of officiating,\u201d he says. Reflecting on those days, a white-haired McEnroe recalls the pressure he was under from his parents, who expected only the best from him. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you feel like, no matter what you do, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d he says. His behaviour left him isolated in the tour changing rooms, but even now he maintains he was always right about the bad calls. Eventually, he earned enough respect from rivals such as Bj\u00f6rn Borg to gain acceptance, and he settled down enough to enjoy an era where professional players could still combine world-class tennis with a rock\u2019n\u2019roll lifestyle. \u201cIn our day, we took performance-detracting drugs,\u201d he says. It is difficult to pinpoint the moment when McEnroe was transformed from reviled tantrum-thrower to imported national treasure. It is as if one day he went into the wilderness and returned with a sense of humour about everything. He is as brash and unapologetic as he ever was, but there is a gentle self-mockery behind it all, not to mention a great deal of insight. It is almost impossible not to like him. Today, he is a man of varied and competing passions. He takes Barker to his New York art gallery, where he fishes through a deep, dark cupboard in search of a ladder. \u201cThis is where the Warhol of me and my ex-wife resides,\u201d he says. He still maintains his lifelong love affair with rock\u2019n\u2019roll, although it would be hard to find charitable things to say about his singing. One of his daughters insists he was a pretty good guitar player, but the BBC is not able to provide any evidence of this. McEnroe at 60, although reflective, is hardly a man on the brink of retirement: he is a full-time tennis commentator when he is not running his New York tennis academy. And he still plays the game \u2013 the oldest guy on the senior tour, and possibly the fittest. Above all, McEnroe comes across as a man sustained by relationships, with family, friends, partners and rivals. They are all here, armed with anecdotes: Borg, Chrissie Hynde (\u201cWhen he would come to London, he\u2019d always give me a call,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew it\u2019s \u2019cos he thought I might have some pot\u201d), his wife of 25 years, his kids, his two brothers. Everybody, it seems, has a good word to say about him. The exception, perhaps, is arch-rival Jimmy Connors, very much the Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film of the evening. But, in his absence, we get McEnroe on Connors: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another player on Earth I have more respect for, in terms of what he brought to the table,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s also one of the biggest A-holes that ever lived. But so am I.\u201d Careful not to swear, as ever.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today \u2013 thanks for reading, everyone. Here\u2019s what happened: New York was home to a pair of Pride parades \u2013 a record-breaking WorldPride event that drew a reported 150,000 marchers and featured corporate and police involvement, and a smaller Queer Liberation March that focused on activism and rejected police presence. Both made appearances at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, where an uprising 50 years ago led to today\u2019s LGBTQ rights movement. San Francisco\u2019s parade was marked by protest. About an hour into the event, demonstrators blocked the parade for more than half an hour in a stand against police and corporate involvement. Two people were taken into custody. It wasn\u2019t the first protest affecting the event: Google staffers had petitioned organizers to pull the company\u2019s sponsorship of the event amid allegations of hate speech and harassment on Google sites. Organizers did not expel the company. And, before we close down for the evening, a quick look at festivities in Seattle, which also hosted a Pride parade today. New York\u2019s WorldPride parade organizers say there were 150,000 marchers this year \u2013 a record \u2013 and that more than 2.5 million gathered to watch the occasion along Fifth Avenue. At least 1,000 joined the smaller Queer Liberation March, according to the New York Post. But the city\u2019s events aren\u2019t over yet: tonight brings a performance by Melissa Etheridge and others, hosted by Margaret Cho, in Times Square. And elsewhere in the city, at Hudson River Park, fans will be treated to a performance by Madonna. San Francisco police took two people into custody following the protest that temporarily halted the Pride parade, according to a police statement: The activists have posted their demands in a letter on Medium condemning police brutality and corporate exploitation: No longer can we sit on the sidelines as SF Pride pretends to celebrate \u2018Generations of Resistance\u2019 on the 50th anniversary of the fight against police violence at the Stonewall Inn. We call on the true generations of resistance including the Compton\u2019s Cafeteria riots to stand here today and end this hypocrisy and demand true support and liberation for our communities. Well, the weather that has been threatening Chicago has finally taken its toll: the remainder of the parade has been canceled due to thunderstorms, the AP reported. Still, participants were able to get a few hours in to mark the occasion. Reuters has filed a report on a confrontation at the Stonewall Inn today which, taken as illustrative of tensions within LGBTQ ranks, excited much comment . Here\u2019s a taste: A black transgender woman wanted to be heard, but the white men wanted to celebrate. The scene at New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn on Saturday, as reported by multiple witnesses on social media, showed how long-simmering tensions between transgender women of color and white gay men have boiled over during the celebration of World Pride and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. The unidentified woman wanted to address the crowd inside the Greenwich Village gay bar where patrons fought back against police harassment 50 years ago, birthing the LGBTQ movement. She arrived unannounced and disrupted a drag show, drawing an unfriendly response at first. The crowd eventually warmed and she was given the microphone and spoke for 12 minutes. \u201cShe read the names of the black trans women who died. Facts about them. Their obituaries. She called on everyone in the bar to help. I would like to say the audience was respectful, but there was quite a bit of chatter and a few jeers,\u201d witness Aspen Eberhardt, finance manager of the gay rights group PFLAG, wrote on Twitter. Reuters goes on to note that \u201ctransgender women of color \u2026 [suffer] from higher levels of unemployment and homelessness [than] their cisgender gay and lesbian brethren\u201d. It also points out that \u201ctrans women are often the target of violence. Some 65 transgender people, nearly all trans women of color, have been murdered in the United States since 2017, according to Human Rights Watch\u201d. For the Guardian, Tom Dart has reported extensively from Texas on such murders and the toll they take: Both New York parades have paid their respects at the Stonewall Inn: While New York\u2019s governor takes action against the \u201cgay and trans panic legal defense\u201d, the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, has signed an executive order to create a taskforce on trans students\u2019 rights. From the Associated Press: The order also directs the State Board of Education on related issues, including publishing resources on the legal rights of transgender and gender-nonconforming students. The taskforce will be made up of 25 people appointed by Pritzker. They\u2019ll study what schools are doing to promote LGBTQ rights to make sure students have \u201cwelcoming\u201d and \u201cinclusive\u201d environments. Their report is due in January 2020. The advocacy group Equality Illinois calls it a positive step, but says stronger statewide protections are needed. Decades before Stonewall, New York was home to a remarkable cultural exchange, as Michael Henry Adams writes for the Guardian today. For black Harlemites visiting Britain, and for Brits visiting Harlem in return, \u201can LGBTQ identity could sometimes, just sometimes, act like a remarkable passport\u201d. Harlem in the 1920s and 30s was a bohemian destination, drawing the likes of Douglas Byng, Lady Louis Mountbatten, and Cary Grant. But all was not well\u2026 Back in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo marked the day by outlawing the \u201cgay and trans panic legal defense\u201d. Previously, Cuomo\u2019s office said, those accused of violent crimes against LGBTQ people could seek a less severe sentence or even avoid conviction \u201cby placing the blame on a victim\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d. \u201cThe gay and trans panic defense is essentially a codification of homophobia and transphobia and it is repugnant to our values of equality and inclusion,\u201d Cuomo said in the statement. \u201cThis defense strategy isn\u2019t just offensive \u2013 it also sends a dangerous message that violence toward LGBTQ people is somehow OK. \u201cIt\u2019s not, and today we\u2019re sending this noxious legal tool to the dustbin of history where it belongs.\u201d Read Victoria Bekiempis\u2019s full report: After a more than half-hour stoppage, the San Francisco parade has begun again. Demonstrators call for an end to policing of the parade (note: this video contains strong language). At least one demonstrator appears to have been arrested in San Francisco, according to the Chronicle, which notes that the parade is facing a backup while protesters join arms through rainbow-colored tubing. Those concerns over police are in the spotlight as demonstrators block parts of the parade route in San Francisco: \u201cWe will not rest until we have a pride free from police and toxic corporations that do not support our communities,\u201d says a letter from the demonstrators, noting that policing \u201cupholds white supremacy, hetero-patriarchy, gender binaries and capitalist rule\u201d. They call for the release of trans people held in the SF jail; the centering of marginalized black and brown trans women; an end to harassment of homeless people; and improved accessibility for disabled people, among other concerns. Kamala Harris, California senator and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, greeted another prominent California Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, before the parade this morning. \u201cWe remember those who marched at Stonewall,\u201d Harris said, according to the San Francisco Examiner. \u201cWe remember those who marched on Polk street in the first Pride parade.\u201d It was the Stonewall clash with police that fueled the modern gay rights movement, and the question of policing has loomed large over Pride marches this year. Indya Moore of TV\u2019s Pose, one of the grand marshals of New York\u2019s larger parade, highlighted concerns in a news conference: \u201cI wonder if they\u2019re here to protect us or if they\u2019re here to police us. Maybe to make sure we don\u2019t riot again? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d New York\u2019s smaller Queer Liberation March has rejected NYPD policing, opting instead for its own private security. And yesterday\u2019s Dyke March in San Francisco saw firm opposition to police: They\u2019re just a few examples of a broader backlash, as my colleague Sam Levin writes, noting that some activists are skipping San Francisco Pride over concerns it has been co-opted by police and corporations. \u201cThe efforts to remove policing from Pride are really efforts to ensure safety for the communities that are there. It\u2019s a protective act. It\u2019s an act of resistance,\u201d Malkia Devich Cyril told the Guardian. And the parade has begun in San Francisco, longtime cradle of LGBTQ activism. Kicking things off are the celebrated Dykes on Bikes, whose roaring motorcycles set the tone for a festive day. Chicago\u2019s Pride celebration is under way despite concerns over weather, with crowds expected to reach one million. Leading the event is Lori Lightfoot, the city\u2019s first openly LGBT mayor. Today\u2019s events mark 50 years since the Stonewall rebellion, which saw patrons at the Greenwich Village gay bar rise up against police raids. Ed Pilkington tells the story of a moment that changed the gay rights movement: \u201cJust being gay then was to be a criminal,\u201d said Tommy Lanigan-Schmidt, an artist who lived then as now in Manhattan. \u201cLiberals would say you should be given electroshock treatments which they thought was being nice; conservatives would simply throw you in jail.\u201d Here\u2019s the piece in full, painting a picture of that night and the movement that followed: While revelers and demonstrators mark the day in New York, activists in Istanbul have faced official opposition and teargas. From the Associated Press: Activists gathered in Istanbul to promote rights for gay and transgender people Sunday before police dispersed the crowd at a pride event that Turkish authorities had banned for the fifth year. The rally on a side street to Istanbul\u2019s main pedestrian avenue drew several hundred people, who cheered and waved rainbow flags. Istanbul Pride organizers said the Istanbul governor\u2019s office banned the march from central Taksim district as well as a square designated for demonstrations west of the city. Police allowed representatives to make a short statement to the media before officers dispersed the crowd with tear gas, blocking the street. Police dogs were also at the scene. The Istanbul Pride group said it would continue activism to get sexual orientation and gender identity recognized in Turkish laws. Amnesty International had urged Turkey to lift the \u201carbitrary ban\u201d on the pride march. It said authorities rejected all suggested locations in the city by deeming the LGBT community \u201csocietally objectionable\u201d. Istanbul had up to 100,000 people attend a pride march in 2014, but police have blocked such marches since. Though homosexuality has been legal in Turkey for decades, rights groups say discrimination is widespread. The new mayor of Istanbul told a group of international journalists Friday that any group should be free to demonstrate as long as protests do not disturb the peace. ... And they\u2019re off (in both marches)! Along with the cast of Pose, the event\u2019s grand marshals include Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, a key activist behind UK Black Pride; the Trevor Project, which offers suicide prevention and crisis intervention support for LGBTQ youth; Monica Helms, the trans activist and US navy veteran who designed the transgender pride flag; and the Gay Liberation Front, the first activist organization formed following the Stonewall uprising. For those following (or curious about) the Heritage Pride parade route, here\u2019s a map. The parade has begun, and the mood is jubilant. Among those leading the way are the cast of Pose \u2013 the FX TV show about LGBTQ ball culture in the late 20th century \u2013 and a car representing the late pioneering activists Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson. Stephanie\u2019s Child, a drag queen trio seen on The Voice, is singing an impressive three-part version of the national anthem as events kick off in New York. They\u2019re accompanied by the Talent Unlimited high school theater department. Joe Biden has sparked a new controversy with comments at a gay rights fundraiser in Seattle. Seeking to highlight progress, he reportedly said that five years ago, if people \u201cmade fun of a gay waiter\u201d at a meeting, it would have been tolerated. The idea that such comments were acceptable in 2014 prompted calls of \u201cnot in Seattle!\u201d, the Daily Beast noted. Biden said a businessman making that remark today \u201cwould not be invited back\u201d. My colleague Joanna Walters has a closer look at today\u2019s dueling marches in New York, amid what is likely to be the city\u2019s biggest LGBTQ celebration in history. Supporters of Reclaim Pride, behind a march dubbed the inaugural Queer Liberation March, say the larger event \u201chas become a bloated, over-policed circuit party, stuffed with 150 corporate floats.

In the meantime, treat yourself to some remarkable photography of LGBTQ pioneers, five decades after Stonewall.

Their game three months ago against England in the SheBelieves Cup will provide a valuable blueprint. The teams drew 2-2 but England won the competition. Naeher said: \u201cEllen White is in great form and scoring goals and we\u2019ll move on to shift our focus and figure out a gameplan to stop that. We played them back in March so we\u2019ll go back and look at that and we\u2019ve watched a few of their games throughout this tournament. It\u2019s going to be another hard-fought game.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/29/phil-neville-warns-england-resting-semi-final-laurels-embrace-usa-battle\">Phil Neville wants England to revel in heat of semi-final against US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alex Morgan, one of those tied with White in the scorers\u2019 chart on five goals, believes the danger does not stop with England\u2019s in-form striker. \u201cEllen White is obviously coming into this next game really confident,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has gained that starting spot and that\u2019s huge. We have to look at her because of the goals she is scoring. We also know we have to look at the wingers and the speed that they have, and the 10 spot, looking at [Fran] Kirby. They have a lot of talent on the team.\u201d</p> <p>Morgan will be trying to break down the meanest defence left in the tournament \u2013 \u201cstingy\u201d is how Becky Sauerbrunn describes it \u2013 but the she knows England are on the up.</p> <p>\u201cThey obviously dominated against Norway, it was a great game for them so we were watching pretty closely knowing that we could very well face them.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s wingers, Ellen White, Fran Kirby, the Lionesses\u2019 speed, a resilient defence \u2026 the way the United States side talk about their opponents for Tuesday\u2019s semi\u2011final in Lyon, you could be forgiven for thinking Phil Neville\u2019s side are the world champions rather than the team from across the Atlantic. Yet the Americans are right to highlight some concerns, given the way England strolled past Norway last Thursday and could even afford the luxury of Nikita Parris missing a penalty with the score at 3-0. By contrast, USA expended a fair deal more energy \u2013 not just because of the weather \u2013 in getting past France a day later. For Alyssa Naeher, the US goalkeeper, concerns are understandably centred on White, the tournament\u2019s joint-top scorer. Their game three months ago against England in the SheBelieves Cup will provide a valuable blueprint. The teams drew 2-2 but England won the competition. Naeher said: \u201cEllen White is in great form and scoring goals and we\u2019ll move on to shift our focus and figure out a gameplan to stop that. We played them back in March so we\u2019ll go back and look at that and we\u2019ve watched a few of their games throughout this tournament. It\u2019s going to be another hard-fought game.\u201d Alex Morgan, one of those tied with White in the scorers\u2019 chart on five goals, believes the danger does not stop with England\u2019s in-form striker. \u201cEllen White is obviously coming into this next game really confident,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has gained that starting spot and that\u2019s huge. We have to look at her because of the goals she is scoring. We also know we have to look at the wingers and the speed that they have, and the 10 spot, looking at [Fran] Kirby. They have a lot of talent on the team.\u201d Morgan will be trying to break down the meanest defence left in the tournament \u2013 \u201cstingy\u201d is how Becky Sauerbrunn describes it \u2013 but the she knows England are on the up. \u201cThey obviously dominated against Norway, it was a great game for them so we were watching pretty closely knowing that we could very well face them. Now it\u2019s all about recovering for them. They\u2019ve really evolved their game over the last couple of years and we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to play them every single year [at the SheBelieves Cup], so I think we\u2019ll see something that we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of, but now it\u2019s who is going to show up to play.\u201d Morgan, though, despite a tough schedule, \u201cfeels good\u201d. \u201cPlaying this many 90-minute matches and playing in the last group, meaning we had the least amount of rest, is not ideal.

      "bodyText": "Kyle Edmund says it is \u201ca great honour\u201d to return to Centre Court for the fourth time when Wimbledon starts today, and the most glorious setting in tennis might be just what the British No 1 needs to kick-start his fitful summer. He will need to be at his sharpest against Jaume Munar, a fiery 22-year-old Mallorcan they call Jimbo (after Connors), who is ranked 88 in the world and whose inspiration is his island\u2019s favourite son, Rafael Nadal. \u201cI am very far away from being world No 1,\u201d Munar told Tennishead.com when it was suggested Nadal and Carlos Moy\u00e1 had set the bar high for Mallorcans. \u201cRafa and Carlos were big, big players and it\u2019s so difficult to get to that level. But, of course, I\u2019m working as hard as I can to get there.\u201d The draw has kept Munar and Nadal apart but he could play a compatriot in Fernando Verdasco if he beats Edmund, who is 57 places above him in the rankings and has had intermittent knee pain since late last year. \u201cIt was a very nice surprise when I saw [the order of play],\u201d Edmund said. \u201cA great honour.

How much negging can one woman take?</p> \n<p>As is so often the case in these Amma Asante-directed instalments, we begin with beautiful imagery, shot from above. \u201cIt takes a village. And machine guns,\u201d says June to us in voiceover as the handmaids cross the bridge where Janine tried to jump. Later, when the handmaids arrive at the Putnam house, they place their bonnets on a round table in flower formation; Asante\u2019s lens again frames the rosette from above. And, with that incredible aerial shot of the staircase that looks like an eye, the handmaids climb on their way to the thanksgiving service.</p> \n<h2>The good old days</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1f0a7c93a2abc4ffd880dfdbb620e1341d75abe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1f0a7c93a2abc4ffd880dfdbb620e1341d75abe/0_89_4128_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke and June at Hannah\u2019s christening.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke and June at Hannah\u2019s christening.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elly Dassas/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We move around this week, flashing back to Hannah\u2019s christening in the old US where the worst thing Luke and June had to worry about was where to eat lunch. June\u2019s mother badmouths the church and their decision to baptise the baby. But it\u2019s largely a happy occasion, allowing Elisabeth Moss to smile for the first time ages.</p> \n<h2><strong>Canada</strong></h2> \n<p>The Canada scenes this week depict the awkward, heartbreaking reunion between Emily and her wife and son. I\u2019ll admit to more than a few tears as the little boy passed his dinosaur book to his mother and asked her to read to him.</p> \n<p>Emily and Sylvia\u2019s reunion is bursting with the unsaid. So much appalling baggage now sits between them. How do you reconcile with an emotionally ravaged wife who has endured years of serial rape and female genital mutilation?</p> \n<p>The little boy\u2019s superhero picture of Emily \u201ctrying to get back to them\u201d is almost too much to bear. Not to mention his very grownup assertion that he shouldn\u2019t hug her until she is ready. That child is adorable and slowly bridges the gap between them. They don\u2019t know how to be together now.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gilead</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b685a7db97e9897bb3cfc0dbbafa35b2e529461c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b685a7db97e9897bb3cfc0dbbafa35b2e529461c/0_47_4128_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arriving at the Putnam house.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arriving at the Putnam house.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elly Dassas/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Back in snowy Gilead, the handmaids are transported in the red van to a reception at the Putnam house, where Janine knows she will see her daughter, Angela. The sense of the unpredictable always makes Janine\u2019s scenes thrilling, but so often end with brutality.</p> \n<p>I almost reinstated the Grim Scale from previous seasons\u2019 recaps this week after Lydia\u2019s gruesome attack on Janine. When she has the temerity to openly express what all the handmaids must be thinking \u2013 \u201cI want to be with my daughter\u201d \u2013 the Aunt unleashes a screaming tirade while clobbering her with a cosh. It is so brutal that even the commanders and their wives look on in abject horror.</p> \n<p>So Lydia has gone nuclear. All the women in this regime experience such ridiculous amounts of pressure, it\u2019s no wonder the dams are beginning to burst.</p> \n<p>As June negotiates the brittle reunification of the Waterford marriage (for her own political ends, obviously) the party continues. All her efforts now are towards Serena who has reappeared from her sabbatical at her mum\u2019s house.</p> \n<p>She is not ready to forgive Fred, but June\u2019s subtle inquiries about offering Serena a more active role behind the scenes get some interest, so desperate is Fred to save face and get his marriage looking respectable again.</p> \n<p>June meets Serena\u2019s \u201cWhat have I missed?\u201d with a dry-as-bone, \u201cOh, jello shots \u2026 karaoke.\u201d She is constantly trying to deformalise the way she and Serena speak to one another. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same side,\u201d her every word and action seem to be saying.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07092088c6062d8347377fe564cca823fe9eaaa7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07092088c6062d8347377fe564cca823fe9eaaa7/0_52_4023_2414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Waterfords with June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Waterfords with June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elly Dassas/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That scene by the pool where the pair sit and smoke together \u2013 a pipe of peace with a filter tip \u2013 offers the greatest hope yet that Serena is turning to the light. Later, she tells June where Hannah may be attending school and the times she could possibly see her in the playground. She seems to be offering active cooperation. But could she be a revolutionary? Do her ambitions extend beyond her own freedoms?</p> \n<p>After Lydia\u2019s eruption and subsequent humiliation, the party is over and everyone looks at the floor, but the tension is cut by the arrival of Guardians looking for Fred. They have video of a Canadian protest in which Luke can be seen with baby Nicole in a sling, smiling at the camera.</p> \n<p>June tearfully confirms that it\u2019s her husband. Serena sobs at the sight of Nicole. Surely this is the end for June? She\u2019ll be implicated in the baby\u2019s abduction now for certain. Has Luke\u2019s carelessness damned her? I can\u2019t work out if she looks happy or relieved that her suffering will soon be over.</p> \n<h2>The sound of music</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3WJ8xIHrNTtP5YsXOqqyml\"> \n <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3WJ8xIHrNTtP5YsXOqqyml\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Alison Krauss\u2019s Down to the River to Pray plays out the episode as Nicole is baptised by a Canadian priest and June\u2019s fate remains uncertain.</p> \n<p>Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open.</p> \n<h2>Under his eye</h2> \n<p>Lydia trundling along on a mobility scooter raised a smirk. \u201cHell on wheels,\u201d says June\u2019s friend as they walk.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d June says to her pious shopping partner, while she\u2019s gazing at her son in the arms of one of the wives. Clever to try to get her on side. But she is not budging. Yet.</p> \n<p>So the scene is set for the world\u2019s slowest revolution. With someone on the inside, June is well placed to start using the regime\u2019s secrets against them. But her focus will be split because of her desperation to see Hannah.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"42ad171a-5e4c-40ca-bc10-8d3dbf7eaea2\"

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, series three, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series. You can find recaps for previous episodes here Surely this must be the episode in which Serena sticks an amputated finger up to the patriarchy and joins the revolution. How much negging can one woman take? As is so often the case in these Amma Asante-directed instalments, we begin with beautiful imagery, shot from above. \u201cIt takes a village. And machine guns,\u201d says June to us in voiceover as the handmaids cross the bridge where Janine tried to jump. Later, when the handmaids arrive at the Putnam house, they place their bonnets on a round table in flower formation; Asante\u2019s lens again frames the rosette from above. And, with that incredible aerial shot of the staircase that looks like an eye, the handmaids climb on their way to the thanksgiving service. The good old days We move around this week, flashing back to Hannah\u2019s christening in the old US where the worst thing Luke and June had to worry about was where to eat lunch. June\u2019s mother badmouths the church and their decision to baptise the baby. But it\u2019s largely a happy occasion, allowing Elisabeth Moss to smile for the first time ages. Canada The Canada scenes this week depict the awkward, heartbreaking reunion between Emily and her wife and son. I\u2019ll admit to more than a few tears as the little boy passed his dinosaur book to his mother and asked her to read to him. Emily and Sylvia\u2019s reunion is bursting with the unsaid. So much appalling baggage now sits between them. How do you reconcile with an emotionally ravaged wife who has endured years of serial rape and female genital mutilation? The little boy\u2019s superhero picture of Emily \u201ctrying to get back to them\u201d is almost too much to bear. Not to mention his very grownup assertion that he shouldn\u2019t hug her until she is ready. That child is adorable and slowly bridges the gap between them. They don\u2019t know how to be together now. Gilead Back in snowy Gilead, the handmaids are transported in the red van to a reception at the Putnam house, where Janine knows she will see her daughter, Angela. The sense of the unpredictable always makes Janine\u2019s scenes thrilling, but so often end with brutality. I almost reinstated the Grim Scale from previous seasons\u2019 recaps this week after Lydia\u2019s gruesome attack on Janine. When she has the temerity to openly express what all the handmaids must be thinking \u2013 \u201cI want to be with my daughter\u201d \u2013 the Aunt unleashes a screaming tirade while clobbering her with a cosh. It is so brutal that even the commanders and their wives look on in abject horror. So Lydia has gone nuclear. All the women in this regime experience such ridiculous amounts of pressure, it\u2019s no wonder the dams are beginning to burst. As June negotiates the brittle reunification of the Waterford marriage (for her own political ends, obviously) the party continues. All her efforts now are towards Serena who has reappeared from her sabbatical at her mum\u2019s house. She is not ready to forgive Fred, but June\u2019s subtle inquiries about offering Serena a more active role behind the scenes get some interest, so desperate is Fred to save face and get his marriage looking respectable again. June meets Serena\u2019s \u201cWhat have I missed?\u201d with a dry-as-bone, \u201cOh, jello shots \u2026 karaoke.\u201d She is constantly trying to deformalise the way she and Serena speak to one another. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same side,\u201d her every word and action seem to be saying. That scene by the pool where the pair sit and smoke together \u2013 a pipe of peace with a filter tip \u2013 offers the greatest hope yet that Serena is turning to the light. Later, she tells June where Hannah may be attending school and the times she could possibly see her in the playground. She seems to be offering active cooperation. But could she be a revolutionary? Do her ambitions extend beyond her own freedoms? After Lydia\u2019s eruption and subsequent humiliation, the party is over and everyone looks at the floor, but the tension is cut by the arrival of Guardians looking for Fred. They have video of a Canadian protest in which Luke can be seen with baby Nicole in a sling, smiling at the camera. June tearfully confirms that it\u2019s her husband. Serena sobs at the sight of Nicole. Surely this is the end for June? She\u2019ll be implicated in the baby\u2019s abduction now for certain. Has Luke\u2019s carelessness damned her? I can\u2019t work out if she looks happy or relieved that her suffering will soon be over. The sound of music Alison Krauss\u2019s Down to the River to Pray plays out the episode as Nicole is baptised by a Canadian priest and June\u2019s fate remains uncertain. Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open. Under his eye Lydia trundling along on a mobility scooter raised a smirk. \u201cHell on wheels,\u201d says June\u2019s friend as they walk. \u201cHe\u2019s cute,\u201d June says to her pious shopping partner, while she\u2019s gazing at her son in the arms of one of the wives. Clever to try to get her on side. But she is not budging. Yet. So the scene is set for the world\u2019s slowest revolution. With someone on the inside, June is well placed to start using the regime\u2019s secrets against them. But her focus will be split because of her desperation to see Hannah.",

Uganda will be keen to avoid that, too, but they\u2019ve decided to rest Kaddu and Lwanga, two of their best players in the tournament so far.

      "bodyText": "The hosts stride on to the next round with a perfect record - three wins from three matches and no goals conceded - and they will be joined by Uganda, who have them a real fright here and should have scored at least one goal. It was a thoroughly entertaining match. The Pharaohs and Cranes may be joined in the next round by DR Congo, who found form at last and crushed Zimbabwe 4-0. 90+2 min: El Mohamady leaps to win a header but then lands horribly, smashing his face into the grass. There\u2019ll be another break as he receives attention. Egypt substitution: Gaber on, Elmohamady off. The manager daren\u2019t withdraw Salah, apparently. No rest for the sainted. 90 min: There will be at least five more minutes. Enough time for Uganda to get a goal to reward their vibrant attacking? 88 min: After much ado about a freekick, Egypt eventually decide who\u2019s going to take it ... and they waste it. Still, they managed to run down the clock, brining them that bit closer to victory. 87 min: Salah, wide on the right, chops back on to his left foot and tries his luck from the corner of the box. The shot flies over the bar. 86 min: Freekick to Egypt wide on the right. El Said delivers, but Hegazi can\u2019t reach it. 82 min: Corner to Uganda, as Abdu tears down the right again and sends in a cross that\u2019s put behind. El-Shenawy makes a mess of his attempt to cut out the incoming corner but gets lucky, as no one anticipated him missing the ball at the near post, so it bounces across the face of goal to safety. GOAL! Zimbabwe 0-4 DR Congo (Assombalonga 78) Their \u2018best third-placed\u2019 prospects are improving by the minute. 79 min: A flash of trickery brings yelps of joy from the home crowd, who haven\u2019t had much to cheer about in this half, which has been dominated by effervescent Uganda. Uganda substitution: Kizito on, Kyambadde off 75 min: Ashraf pads down the left and hoists over a cross. It sails beyond the back post. 73 min: A long ball from the back catches out Hegazi, whose nod back to the keeper isn\u2019t strong enough. Okwi latches on to it and nudges it past the advancing keeper ... and a yard past the post! Uganda still haven\u2019t scored. Incredible! Uganda substitution: Odongkara on, Onyango off. The first-choice goalkeeper leaves on a stretcher. It\u2019s still not clear what happened him: it doesn\u2019t seem to be a contact-injury. Might it be heat-related? There has been no water-breaks in this match. GOAL! Zimbabwe 0-3 DR Congo. Bakambu has struck his second of the game for the Leopards, suggesting that he and his team have found form at last. And it just might be enough for them to sneak though as one of the best t third-placed teams. Uganda are definitely going to finish second (unless they come back and beat Egypt here). 67 min: Onyango goes down and asks for treatment. The ball was nowhere near him at the time so it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s wrong. 65 min: Better from Egypt. They pop the ball around for a bit, deflating Uganda\u2019s vim and then try to up the tempo in the final third and wrench open the opposing defence. But Uganda stay vigilant and fend them off. 63 min: Salah tries to wriggle free in the centre circle but can\u2019t get away from Aucho, who eventually takes the ball off him. Egypt substitution: Hamed on, Elneny off. 62 min: Well Uganda aren\u2019t going to get a goal if they keep shooting like that: Miya wastes a promising freekick with a useless shot wide of the near post. 61 min: Elmohamady booked for tripping Okwi just outside the Egyptian box, at the left-hand corner of it. Uganda will be sick if they don\u2019t finish this match with a goal, at least, given the amount of pressure they\u2019ve put on the hosts. 60 min: What a let-off for Egypt! A freekick from the right reached Aucho beyond the back post and when he flashes it hard and low across the face of goal, Ashraf tried to clear hastily but shanked it just wide of his own post! 59 min: Kyambadde catches Elmohamady with a very late sliding challenge. Then he complains when shown a yellow card. 57 min: Miya sends a good effort spinning over the wall ... and on to the roof of the net. 56 min: This isn\u2019t about counter-attacking any more: Uganda are controlling possession and have corralled the hosts into their own half. Egypt are forced into conceding a freekick some 25 yards out, bang centre. 54 min: Elmohamady fails to clear a cross from the right, letting the ball bounce to Miya, who lets fly from 10 yards. but Elmohamady reacts quickly enough to get a slight deflection on to it, causing it to whizz over the bar. It\u2019s quite surprising that Uganda haven\u2019t scored yet. They continue to create great chances. 51 min: Ashraf wins possession authoritatively to launch a counter-attack. Trezeguet nips a lovely ball through to Salah, who has a great chance to claim his second goal. Running at speed in to the right-hand corner of the box, he tries to curl it around the keeper and into the far corner, but Onyango makes a terrific save! 49 min: El Mohamady harassed into conceding another corner after another promising move orchestrated by Miya. Another bad delivery, though. 47 min: Uganda threaten again, MIya driving inches wide from 12 yards! The flag was up for offside but the replay confirms that he was on. 46 min: Uganda get the second half going. They\u2019ve made no personnel change - Kaddu still on standby - and surely won\u2019t change their counter-attacking zest. It\u2019s been an exhilarating half, and the scoreline doesn\u2019t tell the story well. Because Uganda were the better side for most of it, their speed and enterprise seriously troubling the hosts. But the Pharaohs look to be heading to the top of the group thanks to a fine freekick by Salah and a nice goal on the break by Elmohamady, who now has four goals in his last eight matches for his country. Uganda have shown enough attacking quality to suggest this game is not quite done; and the good news is they are likely to secure second spot in the group even if they lose, because DR Congo are leading 2-0 against Zimbabwe in the other game in this group. Stay tuned! Trezeguet charges down the left and crosses low. It\u2019s fractionally beyond Salah, but Elmohamady retrieves at the right-hand side of the box and lashes a crisp low shot into the bottom corner from 12 yards! 43 min: Kyambadde bothers Egypt again with his searing pace, and then releases Abdu, running in to the right-hand side of the box. Abdu\u2019s shot is weak but El-Shenawy decides against trying to catch it and instead pushes it out for a corner. 42 min: Salah scoots down the right but fails to deliver a useful cross. 40 min: Emad slides in to disposses Kyambadde on half-way. He won the ball but send the forward flying. One of the most satisfying things a defender can do, but many refs frown upon that these days. GOAL! Zimbabwe 0-2 DR Congo. Bakambu has increased the Leopards\u2019 lead and that, at least, is good news for Uganda, who\u2019ll go through in second spot if the scores remain the same. 38 min: Trezeguet takes a brilliant pass by Elneny on his chest and then swivels and opens fire from 16 yards, bringing a difficult save from Onyango. Salah brings the stadium to eruption with a freekick freekick from 25 yards, curled over the wall and beyond a slightly sluggish dive by Onyango. Uganda had been the more dangerous team until then, but the hosts have the lead. 34 min: Abdu scorches past El Mohamady down the left and cuts into the box. He fires off a shot from a difficult angle. The keeper pushes it up into the air, a defender heads it weakly, and Abdu jumps up to head towards goal again. Saved by El-Shenawy. 32 min: Uganda don\u2019t put the goalkeeper under pressure from the corner, and it\u2019s cleared out to Trezeguet, who romps down the left on the counter-attack! Uganda scramble well and shut down the danger. They\u2019re very pesky opponents, as Egypt are finding. 31 min: The irrepressible Kyambadde fires off a swirling drive from 25 yards. El-Shenawy looks in trouble but manages just about to bat it over the bar! He then fell backwards into the net and appears to have injured himself. But after a bit of treatment he says he can play on. Uganda should plant the corner right on top of him now ... 29 min: Nifty work by Kyambadde down the left, swapping passes with Walusimbi before lashing a nice shot goalward from the corner of the box. El-Sehnawy has to make another save. He\u2019s been by far the busier of the keepers. 27 min: El Said flight a corner towards the back post. Onyango paws it away from the head of Hegazi. Egypt substitution: Mohsen on, Hassan off, that injury seemingly being insurmountable after all. 24 min: Miya goes for a goal from the freekick, and misses by a long way. 22 min: Aucho launches another swift Uganda counter-attack with a well-aimed pass from deep. Ashraf brings down Kyambadde, conceding a freekick near the left-hand corner of the Egypitan box. Danger here ... 20 min: After a splash with the magic sponge, Hassan is back on his feet, which will please our man Will Unwin, who wrote this about him. 19 min: Hassan gets clattered by Aucho and the ball squirts through to Salah, who\u2019s one-on-one with the keeper. But the referee pulls him back to give Egypt the freekick. \u201cThanks ref!\u201d think Uganda fans everywhere. 16 min: The whole crowd jump to their feet in giddy anticipation as Salah runs on to a ball over the top. The defender keeps pace with him, so Salah tries to eliminate him with a one-two, but the return ball from Emad is overhit. 14 min: Superb play by Miya in midfield, cruising away from two players before threading a pass through for Okwi to chase. The striker duly gets to the ball first and cracks off a decent shot from a difficult angle, forcing a save from El-Shenawy. 12 min: Egypt are not enjoying this. Uganda are looking lively, quicker to the ball and full of attacking intent. 10 min: Lumalu is down receiving treatment after copping the ball in his face as he charged down a kick by the goalkeeper. 8 min: Uganda are proving quite the irritant to the hosts. They\u2019re fast to launch attacks and have forced a couple of corners in the last two minutes, though both were cleared easily at the near post. GOAL! Zimbabwe 0-1 DR Congo. Bolingi has given the Leopards the lead in the other game in this group. If that screline stays the same, Uganda will seal second place in the group, at least, no matter what happens here. 6 min: Miya\u2019s corner is cleared at the near post. But Uganda win it back and work it wide to Miya again on the right. he cuts inside and unloads a good shot from the corner of the box. It bounces just in front of El-Shenawy, who holds well. 5 min: Trezeguet continues his fine tournament with a barnstorming run down the left. He makes it into the box before going down under a strong and legitimate tackle. The crowd howl for a penalty but won\u2019t get their wish. 3 min: Salah has begun wide on the right again but is taking every opportunity to dart towards the centre, where Hassan is the main targetman. 1 min: Off we go. Egypt begin stroking the ball around confidently but almost come a cropper when Okwi nearly nicks the ball off Hegazi. but the defender recovers. A minute\u2019s silence is observed for the former Zaire striker Ndaye Mulmabe, who died earlier this year after an extraordinary life. A draw will be enough for Egypt to secure top spot in the group, which would be important because it would give them an easier Last 16 tie and enable them to continue playing in Cairo, where the atmosphere for the hosts\u2019 matches is immense. Here\u2019s Nick Ames with details of the controversy polluting the buildup to this match for Egypt. Here are the lineups for the other game in this group, where both teams need to win to prolong their tournament, although even that may not be enough for DR Congo. Zimbabwe: Chigova; Darikwa, Mhlanga, Hadebe, Pfumbidzai; Munetsi, Phiri, Karuru; Chaeapiwa, Musona, Billiat DR Congo: Matampi; Issama, Mbemba, Tisserand, Ngonda; Akolo, Mulumbu, Moke, Maghoma; Bolingi, Bakambu Those lineups don\u2019t suggest that Egypt are easing up just because they\u2019re guaranteed a place in the next round. They want to win this group, which is wise: because finishing top will set up a last-16 meeting with one of the third-placed finishers, whereas the runners-up in this group are likely to meet Senegal. Uganda will be keen to avoid that, too, but they\u2019ve decided to rest Kaddu and Lwanga, two of their best players in the tournament so far. But the excellent Farouk Miya will still be pulling the strings in midfield.

Revenge is gained for 2017 and that\u2019s the fifth time they have won this trophy, and the third in the last decade, having won in 2011 and 2013, too. Dani Olmo, perhaps the best player on the pitch, along with with fellow goalscorer Fabian Ruiz, scored the decisive goal. Andrea Pirlo brings out the trophy for them to collect, hair and beard immaculate. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UEFAUnder21/status/1145428626227286016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 Dani Olmo dinks in second for Spain! \ud83d\udcaa<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/U21EURO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#U21EURO</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESPGER?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ESPGER</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zPCLd4nHJw\">pic.twitter.com/zPCLd4nHJw</a></p>&mdash; UEFA U21 EURO (@UEFAUnder21) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UEFAUnder21/status/1145428626227286016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UEFAUnder21/status/1145432158997241857\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u23f0 RESULT \u23f0<br><br>\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 Spain are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/U21EURO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#U21EURO</a> champions for the 5th time! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESPGER?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ESPGER</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeFutbol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SeFutbol</a></p>&mdash; UEFA U21 EURO (@UEFAUnder21) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UEFAUnder21/status/1145432158997241857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T20:46:09.620Z\">at 9.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d191d3c8f081e8727351564\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T20:36:49.039Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spain are European champions!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>90+4 min: Merino has a shot, and that is the last action of the game...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99fbcb0623e1e6b037ed9fbed28a8bb80b604a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99fbcb0623e1e6b037ed9fbed28a8bb80b604a5d/26_0_4216_2531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain players celebrate winning the 2019 UEFA under-21 final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain players celebrate winning the 2019 UEFA under-21 final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Doyle - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T20:42:00.971Z\">at 9.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d191cba8f081e8727351561\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T20:35:44.660Z\">9.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90+2 min: </strong>Soler, Ceballos and Dani Alves give the ball away when being too intricate once more.

      "bodyText": "The trophy is lifted and Spain can celebrate. Report to follow from Ben Fisher... Spain were the better team, far more blessed with skill and invention than their German opponents. Revenge is gained for 2017 and that\u2019s the fifth time they have won this trophy, and the third in the last decade, having won in 2011 and 2013, too. Dani Olmo, perhaps the best player on the pitch, along with with fellow goalscorer Fabian Ruiz, scored the decisive goal. Andrea Pirlo brings out the trophy for them to collect, hair and beard immaculate. 90+4 min: Merino has a shot, and that is the last action of the game... 90+2 min: Soler, Ceballos and Dani Alves give the ball away when being too intricate once more. Germany try to pile forward, but can\u2019t get it in the box. There is no target man for them. Where did you go, Mario Gomez, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you? 90 min: Can Germany force another chance? They force a corner first. Richter\u2019s cross is cleared. Henrichs is wasteful with a chipped ball forward. Three minutes were added on, and Sivera is taking his time again, having been booked for timewasting already. Oh, what\u2019s this? Amiri, at last, gets a proper shot in, though it comes off Vallejo to deflect into the net. 87 min: Spain playing keep-ball comfortably enough. They have the players to do it. Germany chasing shadows. 86 min: Dani Olmo holds the ball down in the corner, until Klostermann manages to force a goal kick. 84 min: Spain keeper Sivera is booked for timewasting. His team-mates do look tired, it has to be said. But so do Germany, in truth. 83 min: Oh, was that the chance? Nmecha\u2019s backheel fell at the feet of Waldschmidt, who dragged his shot wide. That was a waste, and the Vespa-riding vegan knows it. 81 min: Soler hits the post! He does it with a delicate, guided nine-iron chip, whipped beyond Nubel\u2019s wingspan. There is real artistry among this team. And Soler is supposed to be the direct one. 80 min: Ceballos is fouled by Richter, when having beaten his opponent for skill. If he doesn\u2019t have a future at Real Madrid, he has a future somewhere or other. 78 min: Off comes Ruiz, who was tired, and on comes Merino, once of Newcastle. Germany make their final sub, too. Nmecha is on for Eggestein. 77 min: Spain so intricate. Perhaps too intricate. Mayoral made another flick and Ceballos has a shot blocked. Maybe they could just have ploughed on and shot. 75 min: Almost a third for Spain. Amazing link between Mayoral and Ruiz, who runs on and shoots at goal. Or does he cross? It evades both post and Firpo, who was busting a gut to get to the ball. 74 min: Fabian Ruiz gives it away again, and it takes some decent keeping from Sivera to smother the danger. 72 min: Nunez is booked for a tactical foul, and on comes Mayoral for Fornals, while Richter comes on for Germany in place of \u00d6ztunali. It\u2019s all happening. Fabian Ruiz gives the ball away in dangerous position, perhaps tiring. Penalty claim? No, it looked like both players - Vallejo and Waldschmidt - missed the ball completely. And Spain break, with Ceballos and Fornals holding the ball up before Olmo dinks the ball over the keeper after Ruiz\u2019s shot is deflected. A slight delay for VAR to check that Olmo was onside. He was. 66 min: The momentum is definitely with Germany now, but are yet to offer too much trouble to Sivera. And meanwhile, Spain are dangerous on the break. Ceballos\u2019s reverse pass finds Dani Olmo in space but the shot is a little disappointing. 64 min: Neuhaus picks up more space and plays in Klostermann on the right, and another corner is forced. Amiri\u2019s kick misses everyone. Then Fabian Ruiz comes back to clear up. The Napoli player has been excellent. 63 min: Henrichs comes forward from left-back, and forces a couple of glimpses of goal. Amiri, whose shooting has been wild tonight, fires over the bar. 61 min: Germany sub, on comes Serdar, who didn\u2019t manage to impress on his first start of the championships, for Florian Neuhaus of Borussia Monchengladbach. 59 min: Waldschmidt gets another shooting chance but hits his shot into the ground. He had to hurry and couldn\u2019t get the necessary purchase on the ball. 57 min: Soler is immediately lively and links with Dani Olmo though this time the ball is cleared. 55 min: Spain sub: Soler comes on, and Oyarzabal, who started well but faded, is off. Both players were unused subs back in that 2017 final. 54 min: Amiri chips the ball in after Dahoud, at last coming to the fore, plays him in. Waldschmidt can\u2019t get there. 53 min: A Waldschmidt shot come in at last, and from the inside right position. The ball goes wide. Jogi Loew/L\u00f6w is glimpsed in the stands, hand across his nose once more. 51 min: Germany attempt to gain control and a show a bit of composure. They win a free-kick. Amiri lobs it to the back post, rather mystifyingly, and nothing comes of it. Let\u2019s call that improvisation and improv doesn\u2019t always come off. 49 min: If Germany lose, then Vallejo being allowed to participate is sure to be a point of discussion in post-match. 47 min: Close for Germany and Vallejo bails out his goalkeeper. Amiri\u2019s shot bounced up and off Sivera and the captain wallops it out. He might have escaped a red card but he has shown off his qualities as a defender. And the Spanish start up the metronome again, though the Germans will presumably be a bit wiser to their opponents by now. David Brennan is back, and this time we agree, pretty much. \u201cYou are right about Low and Germany. German football going through a bad time right now. With an ageing Hummels returning to second place Dortmund, every other Bundesliga team is a feeder club to Bayern. Bundesliga clubs seem slow and prodding in the Champions League and what was their strength - in young German players coming through \u2013 also seems to be diminishing with German clubs buying a lot of young foreign players.\u201d One thing is that German clubs are not as ambitious as those in England. There is money there, but it is spent on infrastructure and making the fan experience good. It doesn\u2019t add up to great football, for me, but the fans have a better life over there. Here\u2019s the aim for those young U21 players (some of them are actually already 23). Be as good as this chap. Spain close the half out in possession, as they have done for much of the half. They caught Germany cold in those opening ten minutes. And have held their opponents at arm\u2019s length since then. They are, though, just a goal up. They might also have been a goal down when Vallejo cleaned out Waldschmidt. 45+1 min: There are two minutes to be added on. 45 min: Spain are strangling their opponents, but their attacking has lost a bit of its bite as this half has gone on. Oyarzabal gets chance to break but is closed down and then Baumgartl comes across to stop Firpo surging on to the ball. 43 min: A good atmosphere in Udine, actually. Germany get a corner. Their first? Think so. \u00d6ztunali picks up the pieces after the ball is cleared and Vallejo deflects it behind. A third corner is forced as Nunez heads behind. Then comes a fourth when Nunez does the same again. This time, it\u2019s cleared and Germany are pushed all the way back to their keeper. 39 min: Germany yet to force much in the way of coherent attack. In the stands, a Mexican wave is being performed. In this tournament, of course, England performed a defensive quirkafleeg. 37 min: Lovely turn and pirouette from Fornals, and he almost gets a rampaging Firpo away down the wing. It just falls short but there was a glimpse of Fornals\u2019 quality. He and Felipe Anderson may need their own ball next season. 35 min: After some treatment to the wounded party, the ball is headed over by Serdar. 34 min: Yellow card for Vallejo! And it should be a red. Waldschmidt was speeding off into the distance and the Real Madrid player clatters Germany\u2019s forward. That was high and brutal and VAR says there is no further sanction to be taken. They are happy with that? It was a shocker. 32 min: Ruiz, whose eye is in, tries a long-range free-kick. It smashes off the backboards. Olmo is again dangerous on the right, but then Oyarzabal commits a foul that eases German anxiety. 30 min: Danis Olmo and Ceballis have been linking down the right. Ruiz puts the ball forward for Oyarzabal to chase before Tah comes across to clear the danger. 28 min: It seems something of an oddity that Dani Olmo, who has been great so far, plays his football for Dinamo Zagreb. And he\u2019s been there since 2014. There must be something to that story. 26 min: David Brennan: \u201cGermany\u2019s centre forward? See: Waldschmidt! 7 goals in 4 games!\u201d Well, yes, but he likes to drop back. That\u2019s more an inside-forward. They score goals, you know. See Jimmy Greaves and Alfredo di Stefano for details. Raul, if you will. Waldschmidt is no Mick Harford, is he? 24 min: Junior Firpo has to step out to clear some German danger. \u00d6ztunali\u2019s shot is deflected into Sivera\u2019s arms. Germany better, but bitty. 23 min: Penalty claim for a foul on Oyarzabal? Waved away, and computer says no for VAR. There have been 14 penners in this tournament. No coincidence in this brave new world. 21 min: Amiri gets space, but was offside. Spain had stepped up. Luis de la Fuente Castillo is an old-school coach, it seems. That\u2019s a quick win, and with VAR around not as risky as it used to be. 19 min: Germany looking a little more comfortable than they did at the start, when they looked harassed and in serious discomfort. 16 min: A German attack. Serdar\u2019s pass, and Amiri fires a cross in, though nobody was close to being on the end of it. This is a team lacking in yer classical centre-forward like Rudi Voeller and Jurgen Klinsmann. Mario Gomez is younger than you think (33) but not young enough to play for this team. 14 min: The pass accuracy stats says Spain are making 91% and Germany 78% of their passes. Germany not bad considering, but it\u2019s 78% of very few passes. Stefan Kuntz has swapped full-backs Klostermann for Henrichs and back again. Looks like they are following their attackers, who are drifting all over the shop. So much movement. 12 min: Spain force a corner with Oyarzabal\u2019s skill and movement causing all types of problems. Oyarzabal, the Real Sociedad player, has been the main danger, barring that thunderous shot from Ruiz. 10 min: Jogi Loew is up in the stands, his hands over his nose...as well he might be, as his senior team have not had the best couple of years. 9 min: That was Spain\u2019s first shot on goal bar a couple of blocks but they had dominated Germany. Heinrichs attempts to mount an attack and his ball bounces off a Spain defender but no corner. Nothing going his way. Spain find the space in midfield to get Ruiz in space, from Oyarzabal\u2019s flick. Germany pulled apart, and there was nothing goalkeeper Nubel could do about that. 6 min: First glimpse of Fornals, who is playing off the left of Spain\u2019s attack. Olmo and Oyarzabal link, but the ball is blocked. 4 min: Germany enjoy a bit of possession for a short while, but it\u2019s soon back with Spain. They are going to have to get through a lot of defensive work. 2 min: Spain\u2019s style will be familiar to anyone who has watched their senior and junior teams play for the last decade or so. They intend to dominate possession. And usually do. The matchball arrives on the field in a remote control car, a miniature of one of Uefa\u2019s main sponsors... The Serbian referee, Srdjan Jovanovic, is just 33. The national anthems ring out though the Spanish don\u2019t bother singing along to theirs....(I know, I know). Bringing the trophy out is Andrea Pirlo, who captained Italy to winning this competition in 2000, captaining and top-scoring. Remember, back then, Pirlo was a number 10-type figure, rather than the deep-lying playmaker he is known as. And one of the greatest of all. Inter Milan let him go the next year. That went well for them. Spain are unchanged from beating France 4-1, while Germany have made two changes from the team who beat Romania 4-2, with Benjamin Henrichs returns at left-back after suspension, with Maximilian Mittelstadt stepping back to the bench. Suat Serdar makes his first start of the entire tournament, replacing Florian Neuhaus in midfield. Spain have scored 11 goals in three matches since losing their first game to Italy. Germany are unbeaten and have scored 14 goals. The semi-finals were both goalfests, which means this will be...well, it\u2019s going to be a goalless draw, isn\u2019t it?

Paul Doyle has been copy and pasting away. More to follow when Uganda take on Egypt. Only Ceballos and Vallejo survive from the 2017 final, something of a shock result at the time. Here are the teams. UEFA reminding that Ceballos is a survivor from that 2017 final. He was in the process of joining Real Madrid from Betis at the time. Now that the English have to face down the fact that 2017 might have been the annus mirabilis of the Football Association\u2019s Football England DNA project, it is time to recognise that no two nations churn out youngsters quite like Spain and Germany. Spain are looking to win a third Under-21 Championship since 2011, while Germany are defending champions, having beaten Spain two years ago in the final. The German team coached by Stefan Kuntz, are fired by the goals of Luca Waldschmidt, currently of Freiburg, presumably headed for greater things, though he never made much of opportunities at Frankfurt or Hamburg and lives something of an alternative football lifestyle as a Vespa-riding vegan.

Having passed directly in front of the sun on 2 July to create a total solar eclipse visible from parts of South America, the moon will then become visible in the evening sky. Although experts with a clear western horizon and a very keen set of eyes may catch it on 3 July, the rest of us stand more of a chance later in the week. By the weekend, the moon will have moved further from the sun and so will remain in the sky for longer after sunset. The chart shows the position at 22.30 BST on 6 July 2019. The moon will be unmistakeable, sitting below the body of Leo, and with 22% of its surface illuminated. The night before, the moon will be situated close to the red star Regulus. This is the brightest star in the constellation and marks Leo\u2019s front paws.",

The 48-year-old, who campaigned against the crown estate evictions by setting up a petition, said: \u201cThey [the crown estate ] refused to reimburse me any of the money I\u2019d spent on the property although we were promised if it ever swapped hands there would be negotiations on reimbursement or if I ever left the house. So they washed their hands of what they owed me. \u201cWhen we moved in the house was derelict. I say derelict \u2013 I had to replaster the walls. There was no kitchen, there was just a sink. We did a lot of the property on the basis the rent would remain low and we\u2019d be able to stay there until we die.\u201d Wright said he has since been told by Dorrington that he needs to take up the issue with the crown estate, which, he said, was \u201cnot interested and basically said if you want to take it further, get a solicitor, but I\u2019m in no position to do that\u201d. After initially being helpful after buying the house, Wright said Dorrington had failed to adequately deal with a number of issues. \u201cThey\u2019ve been evasive, very difficult to get anyone to do anything.\u201d He said problems with the front door meant he was not able to lock it properly for a month. \u201cWe were unable to lock the door for four weeks so that meant that one door was, well, open. Only today [in May] has the glazier come out and said it needs a new door.\u201d A Dorrington spokesman said: \u201cUnder the terms of an assured tenancy the landlord is entitled to carry out an annual review and charge rent at a market level for the property in its current condition. \u201cIf the tenant does not accept the proposed new rent then they have the opportunity to refer the matter to the first-tier tribunal, which is part of HM Courts and Tribunals Service. The tribunal will rule on the fairness or otherwise of the proposed rent.\u201d He added: \u201cWe aim to respond to a repair request expeditiously and wherever possible to complete the necessary works within 14 days \u2026 We have no outstanding repairs at any of our former crown estate properties.\u201d A crown estate spokeswoman said: \u201cIn most cases where we are aware that tenants have chosen to undertake substantial improvements to a property, we have agreed from the outset an understanding of how these would be treated at the end of a tenancy.\u201d",

Will Fraine made a maiden first-class hundred as <strong>Yorkshire</strong> initially rattled along. However a mid-innings collapse of three for four sprayed the chess pieces in the air, and only 46 from Steven Patterson took the score up to 327. Jordan Clark took 5-77, his maiden five-fer for Surrey. </p> <p>At Trent Bridge <strong>Nottinghamshire\u2019s</strong> hapless late-middle order lost five for 27 against <strong>Essex</strong> from a promising position of 141 for 3, catalysed when captain Steven Mullaney was caught for a handsome 74. Samit Patel and Stuart Broad then added a vital 43 for the ninth wicket. There were three wickets for Aaron Beard, Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter. Alastair Cook was caught behind off Stuart Broad for 2, but Tom Westley and Nick Browne had reduced the deficit to 141 by the close.</p> <p>A most peculiar innings at Taunton where <strong>Somerset\u2019s</strong> first five batsmen made 346 at nearly five an over, including a hundred from James Hildreth, and the last five just seven runs as <strong>Hampshire\u2019s</strong> Kyle Abbott ripped through the tail with the second new ball, finishing with six for 84. </p> <p>Under forget-me-not skies Zak Crawley and and Sean Dickson put on 132, <strong>Kent\u2019s</strong> largest opening stand at Canterbury since 2006. Dickson finished 146 not out as <strong>Warwickshire\u2019s</strong> bowling line up of waifs and strays, missing six first-choice bowlers, struggled. Middlesex\u2019s bowlers, including Toby Roland Jones and Steven Finn, pounded in without reward at Derby. Fynn Hudson-Prentice, making his Championship debut for Derby, was caught for 99, captain Billy Godleman danced his way to 102. Wayne Madsen missed his first Championship game for four years with a hamstring tear.</p> <p>A century from Australian Marnus Labuschagne, his fourth of the season, and 97 from David Lloyd put Division Two leaders <strong>Glamorgan</strong> made everything groovy despite a mid-innings collapse as <strong>Worcestershire</strong> Brett D\u2019Oliveira took three wickets for one run.</p> <p><strong>Lancashire</strong> found batting sludgy at Sedbergh School, holding its first County Championship game. They limped along to 141 for four on a tricky pitch under kohl skies, but a fifth wicket stand of 87 between Rob Jones and Dane Vilas (67 not out) knocked the stuffing out of <strong>Durham</strong>.</p> <p>At Hove, Ollie Robinson took six for <strong>Sussex</strong> 63 against <strong>Northants</strong> \u2013 his season\u2019s tally now 36 at 18.77.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T22:10:57.925Z\">at 11.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d18fc7f8f082364d7cf3c4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T18:24:46.360Z\">7.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some intriguing games - </strong>quite a collapse there by Somerset, but at least it was a more interesting denouement than the one MS Dhoni conjured up.

I hope</strong> wherever you are the sun is shining, but not too much, the coffee is on you and have time to kill with a little county cricket - even if you\u2019ve half an ear on England v India. There are eight Championship games today, with everyone except Gloucestershire and Leicestershire on the march. Gloucester play Australia A in a one-day game at Bristol, if you haven\u2019t had your fill of victorious Australians yet.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a pretty lip-smacking round and if you\u2019re off to Sedgbergh or Scarborough I\u2019m very jealous. </p> <p><strong>Surrey</strong> have travelled up to the Yorkshire coast on the back of their first win of the season but understrength, with ten players unavailable because of either World Cup commitments or injury, including a poorly Rory Burns. Ben Foakes captains in his place. Keshav Maharaj makes his first appearance for the other rose, after playing for Lancashire last year. Duanne Olivier\u2019s hip is better so he and Morne Morkel can battle out for fast bowling points at Scarbados. Tim Bresnan is still out with a calf injury. </p> <p> At Trent Bridge second placed <strong>Essex</strong>, who beat Somerset last week, will hope to keep up the pressure when they play hopeless Notts, marooned at the bottom of the table. Notts can but hope that a return to their HQ after the World Cup shenanigans will bring better luck. Indian off spinner Ravi Ashwin plays the first of his six Championship games, replacing Australian James Pattinson. Stuart Broad returns.</p> <p><strong>Somerset</strong>, who lost for the first time last week, have a tough match against third-placed <strong>Hampshire</strong>. Dom Bess returns to the squad after his loan period at Headingley. Hampshire have added Ian Holland and Oli Soames to their squad.</p> <p> <strong>Invigorated Warwickshire </strong>arrive at Canterbury. Liam Norwell is out for the season after tearing his hamstring so James Wainman, a left arm seamer, arrives on a month\u2019s loan from Yorkshire.Bailey Wightman, who played for Cheshire last season, is also in the squad. Darren Stevens, hat-trick hero in the second XI last week, returns for <strong>Kent</strong> but Wiaan Mulder, Sam Billings and Ivan Thomas are injured.</p> <p>In <strong>Division Two, </strong>Middlesex are missing Tim Murtagh and Paul Stirling, on duty for Ireland, and James Harris with a broken thumb. The magnificently named Fynn Hudson-Prentice makes his Championship debut for Derby but Tom Lace, on loan from Middlesex ,can\u2019t play. </p> <p>Division Two LEADERS <strong>Glamorgan</strong> return to Sophia Gardens for the first time in nearly three months. Batsman Roman Walker and Lukas Carey join the squad, Marchant de Lange is rested, and Charlie Hemphrey is missing as his wife is imminently due to give birth.The talented Dillon Pennington is included by Worcestershire for the first time this season; Wayne Parnell is out with a hamstring tear. </p> <p><strong>Lancashire</strong> v <strong>Durham</strong> is one-sided on paper, but let\u2019s see what Durham can do after their second win of the season last week over Sussex. Second-placed Lancashire are without the injured Tom Bailey but leg-spinner Matt Parkinson just might get his first game of the season. Durham are expected to be unchanged.</p> <p>At <strong>Hove</strong>, Varun Chopra, signed from Essex makes his <strong>Sussex</strong> debut but Mir Hamza (back) and Danny Briggs (ankle) are both out.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T10:10:43.801Z\">at 11.10am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "An almost full round of Championship games slipped under the radar of events at Edgbaston. Surrey travelled to Scarborough, filled with the confidence of their first victory, but undermanned by injury and World Cup commitments. Will Fraine made a maiden first-class hundred as Yorkshire initially rattled along. However a mid-innings collapse of three for four sprayed the chess pieces in the air, and only 46 from Steven Patterson took the score up to 327. Jordan Clark took 5-77, his maiden five-fer for Surrey. At Trent Bridge Nottinghamshire\u2019s hapless late-middle order lost five for 27 against Essex from a promising position of 141 for 3, catalysed when captain Steven Mullaney was caught for a handsome 74. Samit Patel and Stuart Broad then added a vital 43 for the ninth wicket. There were three wickets for Aaron Beard, Peter Siddle and Jamie Porter. Alastair Cook was caught behind off Stuart Broad for 2, but Tom Westley and Nick Browne had reduced the deficit to 141 by the close. A most peculiar innings at Taunton where Somerset\u2019s first five batsmen made 346 at nearly five an over, including a hundred from James Hildreth, and the last five just seven runs as Hampshire\u2019s Kyle Abbott ripped through the tail with the second new ball, finishing with six for 84. Under forget-me-not skies Zak Crawley and and Sean Dickson put on 132, Kent\u2019s largest opening stand at Canterbury since 2006. Dickson finished 146 not out as Warwickshire\u2019s bowling line up of waifs and strays, missing six first-choice bowlers, struggled. Middlesex\u2019s bowlers, including Toby Roland Jones and Steven Finn, pounded in without reward at Derby. Fynn Hudson-Prentice, making his Championship debut for Derby, was caught for 99, captain Billy Godleman danced his way to 102. Wayne Madsen missed his first Championship game for four years with a hamstring tear. A century from Australian Marnus Labuschagne, his fourth of the season, and 97 from David Lloyd put Division Two leaders Glamorgan made everything groovy despite a mid-innings collapse as Worcestershire Brett D\u2019Oliveira took three wickets for one run. Lancashire found batting sludgy at Sedbergh School, holding its first County Championship game. They limped along to 141 for four on a tricky pitch under kohl skies, but a fifth wicket stand of 87 between Rob Jones and Dane Vilas (67 not out) knocked the stuffing out of Durham. At Hove, Ollie Robinson took six for Sussex 63 against Northants \u2013 his season\u2019s tally now 36 at 18.77. Some intriguing games - quite a collapse there by Somerset, but at least it was a more interesting denouement than the one MS Dhoni conjured up. It was the story of the day really - runs galore then dastardly tumbles of wickets. Those Middlesex bowlers will need a rub-down tonight. Thanks for all your messages BTL - Graham will take over tomorrow and will able to give you the real deal from the Scarborough green house, sea fret and all. Have a lovely evening, the sundowners are on me! Runs a-plenty everywhere, but I\u2019d better think about writing up as the desk will be greedy for copy - it looks like going to the wire at Edgbaston. Cook caught behind for two. Off Broad. Essex 10-1. Nottinghamshire all out for 213 which is much better than it could have been in the current circumstances, where one wicket tends to bring a brace or four. Also they can throw the ball to Broad for the first time in three games - which must help spirits. Essex 10-0 in reply. Three wickets each for Beard, Siddle and Porter. And with a push to point and a hunch and a scamper, that\u2019s the hundred for Marnus Labuschagne! Runs, more runs! His fourth Championship century of the season. All the Lancashire batmen getting in, but none yet to pass fifty, with the odd stoppage for bad light. Lancs 183 for four - not a thriller for all those who made the trek to Sedbergh, especially those in the official Lancashire coach who had that unexpected tour of the local farmyards. Northants have quietly made the recovery of the day from 99 for six to 210 for nine. A quirky little fifty from 21 year old Saif Zaib. Samit Patel and Stuart Broad really have had enough of all this Notts-up talk. They thwack it about in an unbroken partnership of 42. Notts 211 for eight. (an aside: Kohli is out) Somerset wizz past 300 with the loss of only three wickets, the baton passed to Tom Banton (52 not out) and George Bartlett. A hundred exactly for Sean Dickson at Canterbury! Kent 247/2 and this looks hard work for the waifs and strays Warwicks have whistled together. It\u2019s all pretty tight at Edgbaston with Kohli 64 not out. He changes from his cap to his helmet as Eoin Morgan pulls out his ace and brings Jofra Archer back on. Follow it here: Chris Woakes breaks Glastonbury. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 212-2 (Dickson 86 not out) v Warwickshire NOT TEA Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 194-8 (Mullaney 74) v Essex Taunton: Somerset 289-3 (Hildreth 105) v Hampshire NOT TEA Scarborough: Yorkshire 241/7 (Fraine 106) v Surrey DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 259-2 (Reece 96, Godleman 102) v Middlesex Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 235-2 (Labuschagne 87 not out) v Worcestershire Sedbergh: Lancashire 136-3 v Durham Hove: Sussex v Northamptonshire 163-7 (Robinson 5-33) Maharaj about to show what he can do with the bat at Scarborough, with David Willey out for 19 to Sam Curran. It turns out actually that he didn\u2019t really fancy batting today... Notts, ahem, 169 for eight. Luke Fletcher lbw for Porter for the fourth score of under ten. It\u2019s all about the numbers innit. Oh dear, Tom Moores out for nought/nowt and Notts have lost four for 24. It\u2019s the inevitability of the collapse which is so hypnotising.... Marnus Labuschagne rattling along at Sophia Gardens, 80 not out, with Glamorgan\u2019s batting in glorious mode. A first wicket partnership of 80, a second wicket partnership of 75, and an unbeaten third wicket partnership of 55 between Labuschagne and Lloyd. George Scott and Nathan Sowter make the breakthroughs for Middlesex, though at least TRJ takes a catch to dismiss Reece for a so-near 96. Billy Godleman in and out so quickly there was barely time to congratulate him on his 102, 70 of those runs in boundaries. Derby 229-2. Ravi Ashwin may not be the answer to Notts\u2019 question. Lbw to Jamie Porter for five. Notts 162 for six. Oooops, Yorkshire 214 for five. Remember that old adage? I\u2019m not sure the Yorkies did. They\u2019ve now lost three for four, including Fraine for 106. Hear ye Yorkies, this\u2019ll bring a sob to thy hard-nosed throats. Jordan Clark grabs a second wicket at Scarborough and suddenly things aren\u2019t quite so cherry-on-a top rosy for the white rose. Kohler-Cadmore bowled for five. Yorkshire 205 for three. Ah, Mr Siddle, we\u2019ve been expecting you. Notts 151 for five now. Joe Clarke gone for 15 and Notts have lost three for 15. These hundreds a-coming. Now James Hildreth! But not for long, caught at mid-wicket for 105. Somerset 196 for 2. There is gorgeous picture of him having a cuddle with Tom Abell, but I can\u2019t show you as I\u2019ve gone over my photo limit. I\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having please. Aaron Beard, eight wickets against Somerset last week, now has 3-43 v Notts - who are 150 for four, with Mullaney out three quarters of the way to his century. A second wicket falls at Scarborough, Ballance for 23 to Clark (no e). And that\u2019s Will Fraine\u2019s maiden century - bravo!!! A second for Aaron Beard, Nash out for 28. Notts 131 for three. A fascinating bit of body slow-mo from the BCCI. Bumrah is amazing - he only conceded 26 from five overs at the death at Edgbaston, where India have to chase 338. Hope Wayne Madsen has got his feet up, the telly on, and something tasty in a glass. After spraining his ankle yesterday, he is missing his first Championship game for four years. God bless you please, Ollie Robinson, Hove holds a place for those who play, this-a way. Etc. Four for 30; Northants 114 for six. Lancashire finding batting kinda sludgy at Sedbergh. Davies joins Jennings back in the pretty pavilion. Even Livingstone has taken 35 balls to make six. And as I write that my scorecards updates, and it\u2019s not good news for Hass. Out for 24, caught Bancroft b Raine. Lancs 81 for three. Sorry about the small radio silence, slight technical difficulties with home tech not being able to cope with providing England v India and wifi at the same time. Things are afoot Zak Crawley out at the Canterbury run-fest, lbw Rhodes for 72. Kent 135 for one. Master and apprentice. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 116-0 (Crawley 62 not out) v Warwickshire Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 97-2 (Mullaney 57 not out) v Essex Taunton: Somerset 98-1 (Hildreth 51 not out) v Hampshire Scarborough: Yorkshire 130-1 (Fraine 60 not out) v Surrey DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 116-0 (Reece 51 not out, Godleman 63 not out) v Middlesex Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 87-1 v Worcestershire Sedbergh: Lancashire 71-1 v Durham Hove: Sussex v Northamptonshire 96-4 And that\u2019s lunch round the grounds. Scores to follow. And that\u2019s Will Fraine\u2019s maiden Championship fifty for Yorkshire. Well played! Lyth out to Clarke (with an e) for 55. Yorkshire 124-1. What a day for batting! Except at Hove, where Northants have limped to 83 for four, Rossington and Rob Keogh now rebuilding with seven minutes till lunch. Hmmm, chin scratch. Anyone like to read the runes? And Mullaney falls safely the other side of the mountain - 54 not out. Early days but the Notts-up card not yet in vision. Notts 88 for two. Fifties a-go-go: Zak Crawley at Canterbury, Adam Lyth at Scarborough, Billy Godleman at Hove, and Steven Mullaney teetering on the edge with 49... Notts lose a second, another wicket for young Beard. Mullaney 47 not out; Notts 76 for two. Thomason joins in at Hove, adding to Robinson\u2019s haul. Northants 66 for three. Look at the sky! Sapphire, forget-me-not, sail sheet perfect. And the Surrey bowlers toiling with no reward against Adam Lyth and Will Fraine. Sam Curran\u2019s first six overs went for 30. A second for Ollie Robinson at Hove. Newton caught by the keeper, Northants 50 for two. Yorkshire 58/0 and Kent 57/0 making speedy starts. And Billy Godleman has already got fifty against Middlesex. Toby Roland-Jones and Steven Finn being pancaked about the place. Not a good season back for TRJ, unfortunately. Also today cricket is uniting to raise money for UNICEF. Details below if you\u2019d like to donate. There\u2019s a Lancashire wicket. And it is Keaton Jennings to go as Chris Rushworth throws off the cares of carrying a county to nip him out for 11. Which brings in Hass. We haven\u2019t had a whither Hass? moment for a while. After his hundred against Middlesex, form has rather trickled away. No? Ollie Robinson looking ominously good at Hove. Good luck Northants. They\u2019re back on at Sedbergh. I think there is a mouse under the piano. Help!!! Blimey, Kent are giving it some welly at Canterbury - 43/0 after eight overs. That\u2019s more than some teams are getting in a World Cup power play. Four glorious, I assume, fours for Zak Crawley. Kyle Abbot makes a breakthrough at Taunton - Azhar Ali lbw for 12. Somerset 25 for one. Tighten your belts - they\u2019re off for bad light at Sedgbergh - a word that gives me utter brain fade. Are all those gs strictly necessary? Anyway, Jennings and Davies have put on 13. Elsewhere two wickets have fallen. At Trent Bridge, where you\u2019ll have guessed who is batting. Notts are 16 for 1, Duckett Portered for eight. And at Hove where Vasconcenos was lbw to Robinson for two. Thank you to Lee Smith for today\u2019s county cock-up! I think we need visuals... It is overcast at Sophia Gardens, and I\u2019ve just spotted the team sheet for Somerset - yes for young Bess but still no space for the old warhorse. Looks like a stiff breeze rustling the shirts at Scarborough. Here are the teams: Here\u2019s a great read from Tim de Lisle on how England can fiddle through to win the World Cup. Follow that crucial match at Edgbaston below, where Roy and Plunkett have replaced Moeen and Vince. The rather sensationally brilliant Rob Smyth and Geoff Lemon are on hand with the stats and all that and more. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent v Warwickshire Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Essex Taunton: Somerset v Hampshire Scarborough: Yorkshire v Surrey DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire v Middlesex Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan v Worcestershire Sedbergh: Lancashire v Durham Hove: Sussex v Northamptonshire Here\u2019s the pitch at Sedbergh: Good morning! I hope wherever you are the sun is shining, but not too much, the coffee is on you and have time to kill with a little county cricket - even if you\u2019ve half an ear on England v India. There are eight Championship games today, with everyone except Gloucestershire and Leicestershire on the march. Gloucester play Australia A in a one-day game at Bristol, if you haven\u2019t had your fill of victorious Australians yet. It\u2019s a pretty lip-smacking round and if you\u2019re off to Sedgbergh or Scarborough I\u2019m very jealous. Surrey have travelled up to the Yorkshire coast on the back of their first win of the season but understrength, with ten players unavailable because of either World Cup commitments or injury, including a poorly Rory Burns. Ben Foakes captains in his place. Keshav Maharaj makes his first appearance for the other rose, after playing for Lancashire last year. Duanne Olivier\u2019s hip is better so he and Morne Morkel can battle out for fast bowling points at Scarbados. Tim Bresnan is still out with a calf injury. At Trent Bridge second placed Essex, who beat Somerset last week, will hope to keep up the pressure when they play hopeless Notts, marooned at the bottom of the table. Notts can but hope that a return to their HQ after the World Cup shenanigans will bring better luck. Indian off spinner Ravi Ashwin plays the first of his six Championship games, replacing Australian James Pattinson. Stuart Broad returns. Somerset, who lost for the first time last week, have a tough match against third-placed Hampshire. Dom Bess returns to the squad after his loan period at Headingley. Hampshire have added Ian Holland and Oli Soames to their squad. Invigorated Warwickshire arrive at Canterbury. Liam Norwell is out for the season after tearing his hamstring so James Wainman, a left arm seamer, arrives on a month\u2019s loan from Yorkshire.Bailey Wightman, who played for Cheshire last season, is also in the squad. Darren Stevens, hat-trick hero in the second XI last week, returns for Kent but Wiaan Mulder, Sam Billings and Ivan Thomas are injured. In Division Two, Middlesex are missing Tim Murtagh and Paul Stirling, on duty for Ireland, and James Harris with a broken thumb. The magnificently named Fynn Hudson-Prentice makes his Championship debut for Derby but Tom Lace, on loan from Middlesex ,can\u2019t play. Division Two LEADERS Glamorgan return to Sophia Gardens for the first time in nearly three months. Batsman Roman Walker and Lukas Carey join the squad, Marchant de Lange is rested, and Charlie Hemphrey is missing as his wife is imminently due to give birth.The talented Dillon Pennington is included by Worcestershire for the first time this season; Wayne Parnell is out with a hamstring tear. Lancashire v Durham is one-sided on paper, but let\u2019s see what Durham can do after their second win of the season last week over Sussex. Second-placed Lancashire are without the injured Tom Bailey but leg-spinner Matt Parkinson just might get his first game of the season. Durham are expected to be unchanged. At Hove, Varun Chopra, signed from Essex makes his Sussex debut but Mir Hamza (back) and Danny Briggs (ankle) are both out.",

      "bodyText": "Business groups have expressed anger after Jeremy Hunt said he would willingly tell people whose companies went bust after a no-deal Brexit that their sacrifice had been necessary. In a notable escalation of his rhetoric on Brexit, the foreign secretary, who is trailing Boris Johnson in the Conservative leadership election, also said he would actively pursue no deal if a new departure plan looked impossible by the start of October \u2013 less than 10 weeks after the new prime minister takes office. Hunt\u2019s shift towards the harder language associated with Johnson, who has promised to deliver Brexit by 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, has alarmed some fellow Conservatives. A senior party source said it was \u201cshocking to hear an allegedly sensible politician talk so frivolously about the livelihoods of millions of people\u201d. Throughout the leadership campaign Hunt has stressed the potential damage from a no-deal departure, saying he would only pursue it if there was no other way to deliver Brexit. But interviewed on BBC One\u2019s the Andrew Marr Show, Hunt said it could become a policy goal if his plan to renegotiate a departure deal with the EU \u2013 dismissed by Brussels as unrealistic \u2013 proved impossible. \u201cAt the beginning of October, if there is no prospect of a deal that can get through parliament, then I will leave at the end of October because that is our democratic promise to the British people,\u201d Hunt said. Asked whether, under such a policy, he would be willing to look the owners of family businesses in the eye and say they should be prepared to see their companies go bust to ensure a no-deal Brexit, Hunt said: \u201cI would do so but I\u2019d do it with a heavy heart precisely because of the risks.\u201d In a speech on Monday, Hunt will try to allay worries about the potential impact of no deal with a self-styled 10-point plan for preparations, including \u00a36bn to protect fishing and agriculture. It would also include a new, dedicated committee with special powers to boost no-deal planning and a logistics committee to assist with imports and exports. \u201cIf you\u2019re a sheep farmer in Shropshire or a fishermen in Peterhead I have a simple message for you: I know you face uncertainty if we have to leave the EU without a deal,\u201d Hunt is to say at the speech in London. \u201cI will mitigate the impact of no-deal Brexit on you and step in to help smooth those short-term difficulties. If we could do it for the bankers in the financial crisis, we can do it for our fisherman, farmers and small businesses now.\u201d If he became prime minister, Hunt is to say in his speech, his chancellor would begin work on a no-deal Brexit budget, which would slash corporation tax and move 90% of high street businesses out of rates. Earlier on Marr, Hunt said he would tell business owners that a no-deal Brexit was necessary to maintain the UK\u2019s image abroad as \u201ca country where politicians do what the people tell them to do\u201d. He added: \u201cSo if, in order to do what the people tell us to do, we have to leave without a deal, I would do that. But I would find support for those companies to help them weather the storms.\u201d Leading business groups have been careful to not criticise either Hunt or Johnson directly during the leadership campaign, but the comments prompted strong warnings against such policies. Make UK, which represents manufacturing and engineering firms, said these companies were \u201cthe backbone of British industry, and the suggestion that losing them is a price worth paying leaves many speechless\u201d. Leaving without a deal would be \u201can act of economic vandalism\u201d, a spokesman said. \u201cWe call on any and every politician advocating no deal to think carefully about the enormous harm it would do to businesses and the millions of families who rely on them.\u201d Claire Walker, the co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cPoliticians must remember that it is businesses that create jobs and opportunities across our communities, and it is the role of government to create the conditions necessary for these firms to survive and grow, now and in the future. A focus on ideology rather than practicalities does not serve the interests of the UK, or its people, well.\u201d A CBI spokesman said: \u201cThe case for any new prime minister to secure a good deal with the EU is clearcut. Jobs and livelihoods will depend on it.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the comments showed that to win votes from Tory members Hunt was \u201cwilling to sacrifice the jobs and living standards of millions\u201d, calling this \u201cthe height of irresponsibility\u201d. The senior Conservative source said there was intense worry within the party that Hunt\u2019s comments showed both candidates were trying to \u201cpander to the hardcore right of the party\u201d. The source said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be the poorest who will be hit the hardest by no deal. People who use a wage to keep a roof over their heads and food in their stomach \u2013 not Jeremy or Boris or any other taxpayer-subsidised MP. \u201cThose in ivory towers need to realise that this is real people\u2019s lives we\u2019re dealing with, not just party politics. The leadership candidates need to get over themselves and do what\u2019s best for the country and deliver a deal.\u201d One leading centrist Tory MP said should be appealing to \u201cthe mainstream moderate business wing of Conservatism\u201d. They said: \u201cHe will never win by aping Boris as the toughest Brexiter. Theresa May tried that and ended up tying herself in knots.\u201d Hunt has faced criticism from Johnson over his insistence that if a deal was very close by 31 October he might briefly extend the deadline to finalise it. He told Marr that this was actually more likely to make Brexit happen. \u201cIf we got to the end of October and we\u2019ve got a deal and we\u2019re trying to get it through parliament but we need a few more parliamentary days, I\u2019m not going to rip up that deal. Boris is,\u201d he said. In his own TV interview, Johnson insisted he was happy to take responsibility for the consequences of Brexit. In sometimes tricky exchanges on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, during which he appeared to not know the current hourly rate for the national living wage, Johnson denied that he tried to avoid accountability for his words and actions, saying he accepted liability for Brexit. \u201cI played a part in that campaign and I\u2019m very proud of what we did but I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drift and the dither, and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d he said.",

There was nothing spectacular about Max\u2019s attempt at a pass, especially when you consider that in the lap before, Max overtook Leclerc cleanly, but then got overtaken back by Leclerc with no contact made.

The issue here is deciding what point a pass is complete and the other driver has to concede (or run the risk of going off track).</p> \n  <p><strong>\u201c2)</strong> If this pass is not allowed to stand then it follows that the only real place to pass in F1 is BEFORE corner entry as any pass in a corner will have at least one of the drivers out of position as far as the normal line is concerned and if neither will give in one, or both, are headed for the weeds.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs I see it, if one driver is completely next to another before the apex then the pass is complete and the driver being passed has the option to either concede the corner or being silly and trying to defend an untenable position which normally results in an off track excursion.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn this case Verstappen was completely alongside Leclerc BEFORE either car reached the apex, hence it\u2019s Max\u2019s turn. end of story.If we keep going down this path of trying to regulate the racing of of racing then the sport as a whole will suffer.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d18f0ef8f082364d7cf3c0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T17:28:01.911Z\">6.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Dominic Stevenson stands out from the crowd:</strong> \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the only person who doesn\u2019t mind this - if you set up rules a certain way, you\u2019ve got to follow them, even if they\u2019re dumb rules.

      "bodyText": "Ferrari accept the decision ... Here\u2019s the race report from Austria ... Thanks for joining me but mainly Niall McVeigh who put in some great work. Good night. The ruling ... Judging by all your comments, most of you will enjoy the evening now Verstappen has kept his victory and the maximum points from the race thanks to his stunning drive. Big celebrations for Red Bull in Austria. Everyone is high-fiving and hugging. Ferrari will be furious, one assumes, though. Verstappen will be relieved. Who knows why on earth it took so long but at least we finally have one! The stewards \u201cdid not consider that either driver was wholly or predominantly to blame for the incident. We consider that this is a racing incident.\u201d Slow it down ... Jesse Clark says: \u201cI love this kind of racing, it makes it fun. If the penalize Max it ruins the sport. But fair is fair, Vettel got penalized and didnt even touch Hamilton in Canada....so you need to be consistent.\u201d Coming to a live blog near you ... Down the middle ... Logan Riley offers this: \u201cTo me it doesn\u2019t matter whether people think it was fair or not, because first and foremost, Max knew he had the car to pass Charles in the approaching DRS zone with tires that were also ten laps fresher than Charles\u2019s tires, and instead of making the pass where Max knew he was going to blow the doors off Charles anyway seeing that he was literally a beard hair behind him heading into that section of the track, he chose to make an aggressive move that he should have known was going to get investigated if he botched the aggressive overtake. \u201cSecond of all, the only group that the FIA needs to blame is the FIA, because they were the ones that opened Pandora\u2019s Box with the penalty that they levied on Vettel for his racing incident with Hamilton back in Canada (Which might I add ended with no contact at all between either driver). There was nothing spectacular about Max\u2019s attempt at a pass, especially when you consider that in the lap before, Max overtook Leclerc cleanly, but then got overtaken back by Leclerc with no contact made. Max made a reckless decision, and it was a deliberate one at that knowing he had the momentum with laps to spare anyway. There is no dispute, Max deserves a penalty without question!\u201d Your views ... One assumes they are waiting for everyone to leave ... Andy Berkemeijer has two points: \u201c1) Comparing this incident to the one in Canada is incorrect. In Canada the issue was about how to rejoin the racing surface after an off-track excursion. The issue here is deciding what point a pass is complete and the other driver has to concede (or run the risk of going off track). \u201c2) If this pass is not allowed to stand then it follows that the only real place to pass in F1 is BEFORE corner entry as any pass in a corner will have at least one of the drivers out of position as far as the normal line is concerned and if neither will give in one, or both, are headed for the weeds. \u201cAs I see it, if one driver is completely next to another before the apex then the pass is complete and the driver being passed has the option to either concede the corner or being silly and trying to defend an untenable position which normally results in an off track excursion. \u201cIn this case Verstappen was completely alongside Leclerc BEFORE either car reached the apex, hence it\u2019s Max\u2019s turn. end of story.If we keep going down this path of trying to regulate the racing of of racing then the sport as a whole will suffer.\u201d Dominic Stevenson stands out from the crowd: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the only person who doesn\u2019t mind this - if you set up rules a certain way, you\u2019ve got to follow them, even if they\u2019re dumb rules. If it exists it\u2019s on the participants to actually follow it and drive within the guidelines, everyone else seemed to race fine within them.\u201d Paul Cheevers on Max: \u201cI get he is young and hungry for wins. But I\u2019ve been watching f1 since I\u2019ve been a kid and I\u2019m 51 now , he is a dangerous he don\u2019t care how he wins . I\u2019ve watched many times him pushing people off the track and getting away with it . Justice served if he gets pole taken of him. Christian Horner never takes responsibility for him he is just as bad . He was the same with Vettel.\u201d Peter Harris is to the point: \u201cMax ran him off the road. Not allowed. Simple.\u201d Sara Berry offers her view: \u201cHi, I think it\u2019s unfair and to be very honest Max is famously known for his historical passes. \u201cThe FIA has changed so much since the death of Charlie Whiting, where stewards have handed out a number of penalties for a number of different types of incidents. This is my opinion not sure what other people think.\u201d Tom Thayer says: \u201cThis year is the worst yet for formula one. All these rules and regulations are making it a waste of my time to tune in. More to the point when the race is over there should be no more discussion. Penalise during the race if warranted and if you cant make a decision in time then its done. Get over it.\u201d With that, and with two and a half hours having elapsed since the race finished, I\u2019m going to hand over to Will Unwin, who will keep you updated. Thanks for joining me! What\u2019s also becoming clear is that the 5pm (BST) meeting wasn\u2019t to run through the verdict, but to start discussing the incident. As with VAR, the third umpire, etc and so on, the way these things are done can make a big difference between ensuring a fair result and draining all the fun out of things. The FIA have dug themselves a hole here \u2013 they might argue it\u2019s such a borderline decision that they can\u2019t reasonably overturn it, but they penalised Vettel for a similar, if not identical, incident in Canada. What I can say with some certainty is that Verstappen\u2019s performance, which was absolutely electrifying, is starting to feel like a side note. My train home leaves at 6.25pm. Over to you, FIA... Rumours on Sky Sports News that Ferrari have been seen celebrating in their paddock. Which would suggest Verstappen has indeed been penalised, handing the win to Leclerc. But who knows at this point. At two hours, the wait to confirm Verstappen\u2019s win is now longer than the entire race. Several reporters tweeted out a form issuing Verstappen with a five-second penalty. It turned out to be fake \u2013 despite apparently being delivered through an official channel. This is getting a bit silly. On the other hand, the stewards may want to let Verstappen have the win after such a thrilling race, but need a watertight case to appease Ferrari, given what happened in Canada. Who\u2019d be a steward, eh? Long hours. \u201cThe stewards taking this long suggests they find Verstappen at fault, but they\u2019re afraid to make the call because they know it would effectively mean the death of F1 racing,\u201d reckons Emiel de Bont. \u201cAnd I guess they\u2019re waiting for the tens of thousands of fans, who would feel mightily robbed, to have dispersed.\u201d Here\u2019s something to read while you wait. I doubt Horner is feeling anything close to boredom at this precise moment. Sky now reporting that the decision could take another hour \u2013 and our man in Spielberg, Giles Richards, thinks it could be even longer than that. The meeting is taking place right about now \u2013 just as Sky switch off their live F1 coverage. Isn\u2019t the whole point of a dedicated channel to allow space to cover live developments? That\u2019s a rhetorical question. Here\u2019s what you guys think \u2013 as with the pundits and the paddock, opinions are split. \u201cCharles won the race because Max clearly pushed him off the track,\u201d says Claire Bradley. \u201cMax did this repeatedly last year. Fair is Fair. That is why you have rules.\u201d \u201cAfter last week, this is what F1 needed,\u201d counters Cary Raesner. \u201cLet it stand.\u201d So, we will keep you updated as soon as we hear anything \u2013 but it won\u2019t be for a little while yet. This stewards\u2019 enquiry has basically taken as long as the entire race. PA are reporting that Verstappen and Leclerc will meet with race stewards at 6pm, local time \u2013 so in about 40 minutes. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 197pts Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) 166 Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 126 Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 123 Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) 105 Let\u2019s take a look at Verstappen\u2019s standing start: This makes VAR look fast. Here are some words from Lewis Hamilton, sunglasses dangling from his neck. \u201cFifth place, take the points and move on. The tyres were a massive issue, we had the pace but we just couldn\u2019t race.\u201d A quick word with Leclerc, who seems a little despondent. \u201cIt felt like an unfair move to me, but I need to see all the replays.\u201d Verstappen looks far more chipper, but still no official news. We\u2019re still waiting. Martin Brundle is pointing out that the Vettel incident in Canada was a little different, and replays show that Verstappen made no attempt to force Leclerc off the road. Here\u2019s our snap report: Christian Horner thinks it was absolutely fine \u2013 but then, of course he would. \u201cThis is what Formula One needs. Two young guys, going wheel-to-wheel, fighting each other.\u201d On a side note, I wonder how the thousands of Dutch fans at trackside will feel if their man gets the W taken away... Damon Hill thinks Verstappen has no case to answer: \u201cHis nose was in front. Leclerc tried to defend from the outside, and you can\u2019t do that.\u201d This scenario is, of course, reminiscent of Canada when Sebastian Vettel received a penalty that cost him the race: Amid all the drama, it\u2019s a fine day for Honda, whose partnership with Red Bull is beginning to bear fruit. It\u2019s their first Grand Prix win since 2006. Interesting to note that every single driver finished the race, despite all of the excitement. The top three are up on the podium, anthems are being played and Verstappen has his trophy. He still doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s won the race, though. 1. Max Verstappen (Red Bull)* 2. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) 3. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) 4. Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 5. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 6. Lando Norris (McLaren) 7. Pierre Gasly (Red Bull) 8. Carlos Sainz (McLaren) 9. Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen (Alfa Romeo) 10. Antonio Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo) *Pending stewards\u2019 enquiry As the thousands of orange-clad fans head down to the track to greet their hero, we wait for confirmation from the stewards over Verstappen\u2019s winning pass on the way out of turn three. Verstappen certainly pushed it to the limit, but it feels like a borderline decision \u2013 and after a drive like that, having the win taken away after the chequered flag would feel like such an anti-climax. And here\u2019s Charles Leclerc: \u201cI\u2019ll let the stewards decide. I know how it felt in the car. The lap before, he left a gap for the exit of that corner. This time he didn\u2019t, and I had to go wide. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d Some words from Max Verstappen, whose adrenaline must be through the roof just now. \u201cThat was such an awful start, but we had great pace. [The pass] was just racing, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. If that isn\u2019t allowed, what\u2019s the point of being in F1?\u201d Charles Leclerc comes in second \u2013 and within five seconds \u2013 as it\u2019s announced that the stewards are looking at the moment he lost the lead. Valtteri Bottas is third, Vettel fourth, Hamilton in fifth. What a comeback. What a win. What a race. Formula One, boring? Do me a favour. Lap 70: Leclerc is furious over the team radio, having been shunted off the track in that exchange \u2013 but it looked a fair racing incident. He was defeated by Verstappen\u2019s extraordinary force of will. Further down the field, Vettel has overtaken Hamilton to go fourth! Lap 69: VERSTAPPEN TAKES THE LEAD!!! Another DRS surge from Verstappen as he comes through on the inside of the Ferrari. There\u2019s a bump of wheels, and Leclerc runs wide \u2013 and the Red Bull has the lead. Incredible scenes... Lap 68: They\u2019re wheel to wheel! Verstappen tries to lunge down the outside, and sparks are flying as the two come together! They\u2019re neck and neck, but Leclerc holds him off. Verstappen deploys DRS \u2013 surely this is it \u2013 but Leclerc holds him off again! What drama! Lap 67 of 71: Five laps to go, and the leaders pass Gasly. Verstappen is right on Leclerc\u2019s tail now, with the Ferrari having to close the door twice in that tricky opening run of turns. Verstappen will get another chance... Lap 66 of 71: Leclerc needs to get past Gasly, with the gap close to a second! \u201cVerstappen behind, one second\u201d warns the Ferrari radio. \u201cLeave me alone\u201d is the terse reply. Lap 65 of 71: Elsewhere, Vettel is closing in on Hamilton \u2013 just 1.4 seconds behind. This has been an exceedingly rare off-day for Mercedes. Lap 64 of 71: The gap is down to 2.3 seconds with traffic coming up \u2013 including Verstappen\u2019s teammate, Pierre Gasly! Unless his tyres give out, Verstappen will have a chance at this... Lap 63 of 71: Leclerc held up as he begins lapping the midfield \u2013 and Verstappen has cut the gap down to three seconds! Is Leclerc going to be denied that first win again? Lap 62 of 71: \u201cBlistering pace, Max. Keep it up.\u201d Sometimes, the job of a team principal is pretty easy. Lap 61 of 71: The gap is closing to four seconds, with the two Mercedes distant, and Vettel three seconds behind Hamilton. What a final 10 laps this could be... Lap 59 of 71: Leclerc looks to have enough time to work with \u2013 still 4.2 seconds \u2013 but his tyres are a few laps older. Speaking of which, Verstappen is 17 days older than Leclerc. Lap 58: Leclerc sets a personal best as Verstappen takes the fastest lap back off Vettel. The original front row, both 21 years of age, will go for the chequered flag... Lap 57: More good news for Red Bull as Pierre Gasly, who has largely dithered in midfield, moves up to seventh. Christian Horner reports there was an issue with the exhaust centre. It feels a long time ago already. Lap 56: The problem suddenly solved, Verstappen sees his chance \u2013 and swerves inside Bottas on a tight, uphill turn to go second! Lap 55: Verstappen is losing power! Shocked faces in the Red Bull garage as the message comes in. The garage ask him to run some tests \u2013 and that seems to do the trick... Lap 54: The question is how long Verstappen can maintain this outrageous speed on his current set of tyres. Vettel, having warmed up his fresh set, sets a new fastest lap. He will be looking to pounce for a podium place late on. Lap 52: Verstappen is now closing in on Bottas! This has been a thrilling drive after that awful start. He\u2019s barely a second behind now, and six seconds off the lead... Lap 51: With that, Vettel darts into the pits to change tyres, and returns to the track in fifth, behind Hamilton. Lap 50: Will it be third time lucky for Verstappen? He\u2019s much closer this time and although Vettel holds him off into the first corner, the Dutchman has too much in the tank, and powers past him on the way out of turn three. The crowd goes wild! Lap 49: \u201cLet\u2019s do it\u201d is the call from the Red Bull radio as they race into the first turn. Vettel is just about holding him off, using all his experience. At the front, Leclerc leads Bottas by 4.4 seconds. Lap 48: Verstappen has his DRS available now, and Red Bull urge him to try Vettel through turn one, where he has \u201ca significant pace advantage\u201d. He\u2019s firmly in the German\u2019s rear view now... Lap 47: Leclerc and Vettel are both moving faster than Bottas in second. It seems Ferrari and Red Bull may have been smarter than Mercedes in judging the track temperature. Lap 46: Hamilton looks out of contention here, barring a safety car. He\u2019s 13 seconds behind Verstappen. Lap 44: Verstappen has set a new fastest lap, and is closing fast on Vettel with DRS in hand. McLaren ask Norris to try and hold up Ricciardo (and Red Bull\u2019s Gasly) behind him. \u201cForever?\u201d asks the bemused driver. Forever ever. Lap 42: Norris does finally get around Ricciardo and up to sixth, although the top five are now off in the distance. Sainz finally goes in, and re-emerges in 14th. Lap 40: Mercedes still believe there\u2019s a race to be won here, with the field expected to bunch up again in the latter stages. Verstappen is on the move, closing to within 2.5 seconds of Vettel in third. Lap 39: Ricciardo has still not been called in by Renault, and is under serious pressure from Norris and Gasly. The Australian has to have his wits about it to cut off an attempted overtake from the McLaren driver. Lap 37: Hamilton is still not back up to full throttle, and trails Verstappen by eight seconds now. A long way back to a podium place now. Lap 36: Meanwhile, Leclerc is cruising along in first place \u2013 he\u2019s set the fastest lap, and his lead over Bottas is out to five seconds. Lap 35: At the halfway stage, and it\u2019s been a great first half for Ferrari - that pit-stop mix-up aside. Norris, who will be back up to sixth once Sainz and Ricciardo pit, has gone to medium tyres, which will be interesting in the final few laps. Lap 34 of 71: After that flurry of pit-based drama, here\u2019s the top 10, with Leclerc back at the front of the pack: 1. Leclerc 2. Bottas 3. Vettel 4. Verstappen 5. Hamilton 6. Sainz (yet to pit) 7. Ricciardo (yet to pit) 8. Norris 9. Gasly 10. Raikkonen Lap 32 of 71: Verstappen briefly leads before pitting and switching to hard tyres. He heads back onto the track in fourth, sandwiched between Vettel and Hamilton. Lap 31 of 71: It was an 11-second stop \u2013 not bad by any means \u2013 but Hamilton emerges in fifth, behind Vettel who is flying, setting a new fastest lap! Lap 30 of 71: Hamilton is coming in, and will need his front wing to be changed! The speed at which Mercedes get this done could be crucial, although he\u2019s already lost plenty of time... Lap 28 of 71: Hamilton has a problem with his front wing, and it may need replacing when he pits. He\u2019s still leading, but losing time \u2013 and may end up behind teammate Bottas when he gets back on track. Lap 27 of 71: This has been a cracking race so far. Hamilton is heading in imminently \u2013 he\u2019s losing downforce, and getting reeled in by Verstappen! Lap 26 of 71: Pierre Gasly and Norris come in as Hamilton endures another wobble through a corner. He\u2019s racing close to the edge here, trying to push his medium tyres as far as he can. Lap 25 of 71: Hamilton and Verstappen, who haven\u2019t pitted yet, lead Leclerc. Vettel is sixth after quickly working his way back through the field. Lap 24 of 71: Raikkonen comes in, while Bottas pitted shortly after Vettel \u2013 which means Hamilton is in the lead! What\u2019s more, he says the tyres are OK for now. Things are suddenly looking up for Mercedes... Lap 23 of 71: A smoother pit stop for Leclerc, with drivers switching to hard tyres. Magnussen very much the canary in the mine \u2013 he switched to hards five laps ago, and has managed to keep up at the back. Lap 22 of 71: ...and the move massively backfires for Ferrari, who weren\u2019t really ready for a quickfire tyre change. In fact, the pit crew were still scurrying around fetching the tyres when Vettel came in. Yikes! Lap 21 of 71: Hamilton runs wide on the first turn, and Vettel looks to pounce on his lack of pace with a duck into the pits... Lap 20 of 71: Vettel picks up the fastest lap baton, and keeps shaving time off the gap to Hamilton... Lap 18 of 71: Mercedes aren\u2019t having things their own way here \u2013 Vettel is getting closer to Hamilton, and Bottas is losing ground on Leclerc. Close to a five-second lead for the 21-year-old now. Lap 17 of 71: Verstappen sets a new fastest lap! He\u2019s been going at a blistering pace \u2013 such a shame he messed up the start so spectacularly. Lap 16 of 71: \u201cGo to Plan A\u201d is the instruction from the Ferrari garage to Leclerc. That\u2019s not really how Plan A normally works, but I presume that means the soft tyres are holding up well. Lap 15 of 71: Poor old Kevin Magnussen. From an initial qualifying position of fifth, he\u2019s now dead last after getting a drive-through penalty for creeping out of his box at the start line. Lap 13 of 71: Norris is coming for Raikkonen, and after two laps of bumper-to-bumper stuff, he overtakes silkily at turn three and gets back into the top six! Lap 12 of 71: Leclerc has eked out a 3.5 second lead over Bottas, who leads Hamilton by a similar margin. Mercedes are having issues with their tyres, too \u2013 plenty of \u2018lifting and coasting\u2019 going on to try and regulate the tyre temperature. Tricky when the surface temperature is 20 degrees higher than usual. Lap 11 of 71: Christian Horner confirms Verstappen suffered an anti-stall, but is now \u201chead down, trying to get back to Vettel ahead.\u201d He says the \u2018clipping\u2019 energy issues the Dutchman was suffering are now resolved. Lap 10 of 71: The two Haas drivers, Magnussen and Grosjean, are really struggling \u2013 both have dropped into the bottom six as their tyres overheat. Cooked on the outside, cold in the middle, apparently. Gordon Ramsay would not be impressed. Lap 9 of 71: Verstappen is motoring now, and hares past Raikkonen and up to fifth. He\u2019s four seconds behind Vettel, who is 10 seconds adrift of the front three. Lap 8 of 71: Norris has complained over his team radio that Raikkonen \u201cran me off the track\u201d. The stewards took a look, but decided not to take it any further. Lap 7 of 71: Vettel employs his DRS to scoot past Raikkonen and up to fourth! Verstappen, who was having power issues, emphatically resolves them as he overtakes Norris. Lap 5 of 71: Here\u2019s the top 10 after that full-throttle start: 1. Leclerc 2. Bottas 3. Hamilton 4. Raikkonen 5. Vettel 6. Norris 7. Verstappen 8. Gasly 9. Giovinazzi 10. Perez Lap 4 of 71: Norris and Vettel are locked in a furious battle for fifth, with the Ferrari man squeezing past and holding off the teenager through turn four. All told, things going pretty well for Ferrari so far... Lap 2 of 71: Leclerc sets the fastest lap, and leads Bottas by two seconds. Verstappen\u2019s terrible start appears to have been down to the anti-stall mechanism kicking in. It\u2019s bad news for the hordes of orange-clad Red Bull fans in the stands. Lap 1 of 71: Charles Leclerc holds his lead, with Bottas second and Hamilton immediately up into a podium place. Verstappen has dropped to seventh, behind Kimi Raikkonen, Lando Norris and Sebastian Vettel, who has jumped up from ninth! Away we go \u2013 and Max Verstappen makes a terrible start, allowing Bottas to zip past him. Everyone\u2019s through the first few turns without incident, but Verstappen has lost a fair few places... The drivers are off on their formation lap, testing their tyres on this sizzling surface. Leclerc is starting on softs, Verstappen on medium \u2013 that gamble could make or break the race for Ferrari. The heat is on! Lewis Hamilton, talking over the team radio, says this feels like \u201cthe hottest race I\u2019ve ever had\u201d. It\u2019s a balmy 32 degrees even at altitude in Spielberg, with the track temperature pushing 60 degrees. Phew, what a scorcher, etc. Just to clear up some grid-based confusion \u2013 Hamilton is fourth, despite getting an initial three-place penalty from second. That\u2019s because Kevin Magnussen received a five-place penalty, and drops down to 10th. Also, George Russell will start from the pit lane after his Williams required some front-wing repairs. 1 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 2 Max Verstappen (Neth) Red Bull 3 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 4 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 5 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren 6 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen (Fin) Alfa Romeo 7 Antonio Giovinazzi (It) Alfa Romeo 8 Pierre Gasly (Fr) Red Bull 9 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 10 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas 11 Romain Grosjean (Fr) Haas 12 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 13 Alexander Albon (Thai) Toro Rosso 14 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 15 Carlos Sainz (Sp) McLaren 16 Sergio P\u00e9rez (Mex) Racing Point 17 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 18 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Toro Rosso 19 George Russell (GB) Williams 20 Robert Kubica (Pol) Williams Three months ago in Bahrain, Charles Leclerc was cruising to his first-ever Grand Prix win and threatening to shake up the F1 title race. Then, with 11 laps to go, his Ferrari gave out. Lewis Hamilton apologetically rolled past Leclerc to take the chequered flag, and normal service was resumed. Hamilton has won five of the six races since; the other was won by his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas. In the constructors\u2019 championship, Mercedes have more points than Ferrari and Red Bull put together, and Hamilton\u2019s dominant summer has left the paddock worried about F1\u2019s chronic lack of drama. That might change today thanks to Leclerc, who begins on pole after a storming run in qualifying. Hamilton\u2019s three-place grid penalty means last year\u2019s winner here, Max Verstappen, starts alongside him in an impossibly young front row. Hamilton starts in fourth behind Bottas, with another young gun, McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris in fifth and Sebastian Vettel down in ninth. Even if Hamilton does make it five wins on the spin, this should be more exciting than the ennui of the French Grand Prix.",

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull planned to bring on legislation giving effect to the national energy guarantee to stare down opposition from conservative dissidents in the Coalition party room, but pulled back after Peter Dutton and Christopher Pyne \u201cwent nuts\u201d. Fresh details about the internal brawl over the fate of Turnbull\u2019s signature energy policy are recorded in a new book about the Liberal leadership implosion last August by journalist and former political staffer Niki Savva, Plots and Prayers: Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s Demise and Scott Morrison\u2019s Ascension, which will be in bookshops on Monday. The in-depth account of the brutal power struggle that saw Scott Morrison take the prime ministership coincides with the return of MPs to Canberra for the first sitting of federal parliament since the May election. While the coming week will be dominated by ceremonial events to mark the opening of the 46th parliament, and condolences after Bob Hawke\u2019s death last month, the Coalition will push ahead with its $158bn income tax cut package on Tuesday, with Senate debate expected Thursday. The Labor caucus will gather on Monday to thrash out internal divisions about whether to pass all three stages of the proposal. Thus far, Labor has declined to support stage three, which is targeted at high-income earners, and the shadow finance minister said Sunday the opposition would be influenced by where the crossbench landed. Pre-publicity for the Savva book has focused on revelations that Turnbull clashed with the attorney general, Christian Porter, over whether the governor general could refuse to appoint Dutton because of the doubts over the home affairs minister\u2019s eligibility to sit in parliament, and the early activity of Morrison\u2019s numbers men in helping their candidate thwart Dutton\u2019s bid for the leadership. But there is also a chapter laying out the frantic manoeuvring around the energy policy pursued by the then prime minister and the then energy minister, Josh Frydenberg \u2013 a policy that was a catalyst for the end of Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership because of an internal brawl about the proposed emissions reduction target for the electricity sector. Dutton is quoted in the book decrying the policy as \u201cnoodle nation Neg\u201d and saying Turnbull planned to bring on the legislation in parliament even though the policy was resisted by a group of party conservatives who were threatening to vote against it. The home affairs minister is said to have believed that Turnbull\u2019s strategy of trying to isolate internal dissenters by proceeding to court Labor\u2019s support for the necessary legislation would only lead to disaster. \u201cTurnbull\u2019s plan was to bring the Neg on [in parliament],\u201d Dutton is quoted as saying by Savva. \u201cPyne and I went nuts.\u201d Dutton is quoted as saying: \u201cMalcolm\u2019s plan with the Neg was to get the states to agree through Coag, then have the states pressure Bill Shorten to support the legislation, and from there what he thought would happen was on one side would be the Liberal party and the Nationals and Labor. Sitting on the other side would be Tony Abbott and fringe-dwellers. \u201cIt was never going to happen. There were 20 people on our side who were not going back to their electorates with photos of them sitting next to Tanya Plibersek voting on a motion supporting climate change. \u201cIt would have been a complete disaster for the government. We effectively had the bill pulled.\u201d The author says Dutton\u2019s account of dissuading Turnbull was confirmed subsequently by Pyne, the then manager of government business. Pyne says he and Dutton convinced Turnbull not to go down the path of splitting the government and not proceed with the legislation until MPs were on the same page. Even though the Coalition party room had given the proposal in-principle backing despite the lingering dissent, leading Frydenberg to lodge the legislation with the tabling office, Pyne intervened and removed the legislation. The internal crisis over the Neg continued to escalate, with a Turnbull adviser proposing a regulatory option for the emissions reduction target, which was then leaked, causing more internal angst. During a cabinet meeting on the Sunday night before the week Turnbull lost the prime ministership, Pyne advocated putting the policy on ice. Pyne is quoted telling colleagues at the meeting: \u201cWe can keep dragging our bloodied stump across the political firmament, leaving a trail of gore behind us, or we can cut our losses and move on.\u201d With the government plunged into the leadership crisis that would play out over the next five days, Pyne is said to have challenged Dutton at that cabinet meeting to articulate his position on what should happen with the energy policy. Dutton agreed the Neg should be effectively abandoned, a decision that was outlined by Turnbull the following day.",

It\u2019s hard to know how people are going to respond when you\u2019ve had an experience like that but I\u2019ve grown in the process of sharing and writing, reaching out to others and others reaching out to me.\u201d</p> <p>She recommends having a support system and good self-care practices when sharing traumatic information. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell everyone but it\u2019s important for the people who matter most in your life.

She hadn\u2019t spoken about it ever. All of a sudden, people start making disclosures and it doesn\u2019t become shameful any more.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Cathy Kezelman, president of the <a href=\"http://www.blueknot.org.au\">Blue Knot foundation</a>, a national organisation helping adults recover from childhood trauma, says Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/final_report_-_volume_4_identifying_and_disclosing_child_sexual_abuse.pdf\">royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse</a> had found it takes an average of 24 years for people to speak about their abuse. \u201cSome never do,\u201d she says. The Blue Knot helpline has received calls from people disclosing for the first time in their 70s, 80s and 90s.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a society that hasn\u2019t wanted to hear about it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs we saw in the royal commission, a lot of people giving testimony spoke about trying to speak out as a child. Many were punished, they weren\u2019t believed and their concerns were dismissed or minimised.</p> <p>\u201cThinking about abuse or neglect of a child is inherently discomforting for us all. Often people hearing the disclosure don\u2019t know what to say. Counsellors with insufficient training, despite the best of intentions, can retraumatise victims.\u201d</p> <p>It takes a long time for victims to process and recognise what happened to them <em>was </em>abuse, Kezelman adds. \u201cThey are often abused by people supposed to care for them. Some people don\u2019t remember their abuse, or only parts of it. And often they haven\u2019t made connection between the struggles they\u2019re having in their life and what happened to them as a child.\u201d</p> <p>Mellita Bate, a manager and counsellor with <a href=\"http://www.interrelate.org.au\">Interrelate</a>, provided support to victims coming forward to the royal commission. She says the insidious nature of the grooming process is behind why most people keep sexual abuse bottled up inside. The egocentric nature of children feeds into self-blame. \u201cMost perpetrators start touching just a little bit inappropriately to see if they can get away with it and to work out if that child has the capacity to tell an adult,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they start to perpetrate the abuse they use threats and emotional blackmail.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a major rewiring of the brain that can often leave people in a perpetual state of alarm</p> <footer> <cite>Craig Hughes-Cashmore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another disincentive for disclosing abuse is the pain of reliving it. \u201cWe have in our human nature a way of dealing with trauma by just holding it locked away somewhere,\u201d Bate says. When people do disclose, it\u2019s for various reasons in different environments. Triggers, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">#MeToo movement</a> and royal commission, and the desire to obtain justice, are common motives for finally speaking out, she says.</p> <p>It\u2019s especially hard to disclose sex abuse if you\u2019re male. A 2014 paper by Sydney Law School<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/CICrimJust/2014/14.pdf\">found males are much less likely than females to disclose child sexual abuse</a> at the time it occurs, take longer to disclose, and make fewer and more selective disclosures.</p> <p>Craig Hughes-Cashmore, chief executive of Survivors and Mates Survivors Network, <a href=\"https://www.samsn.org.au/\">a not-for-profit assisting male survivors</a> of sex abuse, frames the discussion around gender stereotypes: \u201cWomen are victims and men are perpetrators; men don\u2019t cry; men don\u2019t seek help,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The added fear and confusion about sexual preference adds to their silence. \u201cThe bulk of perpetrators are male, so if you\u2019re a boy and are sexually abused by a same-sex person and you have a physical response, you\u2019re left very confused about your sexuality,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Hughes-Cashmore was himself abused as a child. It began in his early teens when his parents were going through a separation and a friend of his father\u2019s moved into the family home.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a friend and a work colleague of my father\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it was nice to get that attention. My dad had met a new woman and my mum was freaking out. It kind of suited them for this guy to take an interest as well because they were trying to piece their lives together.\u201d</p> <p>Of his experience, he says \u201cyour own sexual development is taken from you and that\u2019s a really horrible legacy to be left with. We [survivors] didn\u2019t have that exploration thing kids talk about, the first kiss and that sort of stuff is denied, and I don\u2019t think we talk about that much but I think it really, really sucks if your first experience, like mine, is being raped.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from the destruction of natural sexual development there is the damage done to mental and emotional development.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about interrupting the development of the brain of a child and their education. It\u2019s a major rewiring of the brain that can often leave people in a perpetual state of alarm, a heightened sense of who\u2019s around me, what\u2019s happening and constant vigilance. I was like that for years and depressed and suicidal because the world wasn\u2019t safe, and everyone had an ulterior motive and who do you trust?</p> <p>\u201cTrust is a massive issue for people who\u2019ve been abused. Because often these people were people we looked up to and admired.\u201d</p> <p>More damaging than sexual confusion and a potent reason for long-held silence, says Hughes-Cashmore, is the abiding belief that victims are more likely to become sexual predators themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of demonising victims.\u201d</p> <p>Regardless of gender, associations with mental health instability and the view the victim didn\u2019t do enough to stop the abuse is another obstacle to potential sharing of the subject. \u201cThis shows a lack of understanding on the behalf of the public about the grooming process and the power imbalance between children and adults,\u201d Hughes-Cashmore says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef64857ce551d230d1bdef9e7c5f69f429bee0a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef64857ce551d230d1bdef9e7c5f69f429bee0a3/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Savage, child sexual abuse victim, in King Edward Park in his home town of Newcastle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Savage, a child sexual abuse victim, in King Edward Park in his home town of Newcastle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Lorimer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Owing to their own sense of shame, many survivors expect judgment from society, he says.</p> <p>One man who found the strength to speak out is Adam Savage.

In 2017, as part of his healing and to get the perpetrators to confess their crime, he met them to ask why they had abused him.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year Erin Delaney revealed on Facebook a secret she\u2019d kept from almost everyone. As a child she suffered physical and emotional abuse and severe neglect. The neglect had significant consequences, including a fractured skull from falling \u2013 which was only picked up when, after she vomited at school the next day, a member of her extended family intervened and took her to hospital. The emotional abuse included both parents telling her at different times that the other was dead, or that they weren\u2019t her real parents; the physical abuse \u2013 the hitting, the kicking \u2013 depended on their drug use and moods. \u201cIt was,\u201d the 36-year-old Sydneysider says now, \u201ca challenging journey through life. I never felt safe and I never felt grounded. You grow up hating yourself and thinking you caused it and you deserve it.\u201d Wondering if she\u2019d lose all her friends once they \u201cknew the truth\u201d, the usually articulate and witty writer withdrew. \u201cI knew it would impact how people thought about me and I was terrified,\u201d she admits. \u201cI began to doubt myself and believe no one would be interested, that someone might use it against me somehow.\u201d Delaney had always felt like she had two different selves: her secret, real self and a superficial, public persona cultivated to blend in. \u201cI want to hear my real voice because it\u2019s been silenced for 36 years.\u201d Her decision to post her story was inspired by a Guardian article about the widespread misdiagnosis of trauma survivors and her desire to educate people about trauma. She attributes internalised self-blame, hurtful reactions and dehumanising labels from professionals for why she kept silent so long. She first told her story to the daughter of a Christian family she was staying with as a teen and was reprimanded. At 18, she attempted suicide. The psychiatric registrar told her to do it properly next time. \u201cThat pushed me back into my shell for years,\u201d she says. Delaney, who suffers from complex post-traumatic stress disorder, says society treats different medical conditions unequally. \u201cOne of my old school friends had cancer a few years ago and everyone offered to help, while my emotional injuries are a source of shame and isolation.\u201d Many people have since shared their own secrets of abuse with Delaney. \u201cWhat broke my heart was it was all in private messages,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were too scared to share it openly. I want to take the power away from my abusers and the only power they have over me is my silence and shame. To adult survivors, don\u2019t let the fuckers who stole your joy keep stealing it even one more day.\u201d Kelly Humphries, a 37-year-old Queensland senior police constable, went to the police about her uncle\u2019s sexual abuse when she was 19, but she didn\u2019t speak publicly about it till her 30s. She has written a memoir, Unscathed Beauty, about her recovery. \u201cI want people to know they\u2019re not on their own,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much happens behind closed doors [that] nobody ever talks about. I\u2019ve always known since I was a child I didn\u2019t want it to happen to anyone else.\u201d Humphries, who worked in child protection for six years, first spoke out about her abuse at Toastmasters in 2015. \u201cIt was a bit controversial for them but I think they recognised the courage it took. It\u2019s hard to know how people are going to respond when you\u2019ve had an experience like that but I\u2019ve grown in the process of sharing and writing, reaching out to others and others reaching out to me.\u201d She recommends having a support system and good self-care practices when sharing traumatic information. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell everyone but it\u2019s important for the people who matter most in your life. People can\u2019t support you if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.\u201d Disclosing has enabled others to share their stories, including her mother. \u201cShe revealed to me that it\u2019s happened to her as well. She hadn\u2019t spoken about it ever. All of a sudden, people start making disclosures and it doesn\u2019t become shameful any more.\u201d Dr Cathy Kezelman, president of the Blue Knot foundation, a national organisation helping adults recover from childhood trauma, says Australia\u2019s royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse had found it takes an average of 24 years for people to speak about their abuse. \u201cSome never do,\u201d she says. The Blue Knot helpline has received calls from people disclosing for the first time in their 70s, 80s and 90s. \u201cWe have a society that hasn\u2019t wanted to hear about it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs we saw in the royal commission, a lot of people giving testimony spoke about trying to speak out as a child. Many were punished, they weren\u2019t believed and their concerns were dismissed or minimised. \u201cThinking about abuse or neglect of a child is inherently discomforting for us all. Often people hearing the disclosure don\u2019t know what to say. Counsellors with insufficient training, despite the best of intentions, can retraumatise victims.\u201d It takes a long time for victims to process and recognise what happened to them was abuse, Kezelman adds. \u201cThey are often abused by people supposed to care for them. Some people don\u2019t remember their abuse, or only parts of it. And often they haven\u2019t made connection between the struggles they\u2019re having in their life and what happened to them as a child.\u201d Mellita Bate, a manager and counsellor with Interrelate, provided support to victims coming forward to the royal commission. She says the insidious nature of the grooming process is behind why most people keep sexual abuse bottled up inside. The egocentric nature of children feeds into self-blame. \u201cMost perpetrators start touching just a little bit inappropriately to see if they can get away with it and to work out if that child has the capacity to tell an adult,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they start to perpetrate the abuse they use threats and emotional blackmail.\u201d Another disincentive for disclosing abuse is the pain of reliving it. \u201cWe have in our human nature a way of dealing with trauma by just holding it locked away somewhere,\u201d Bate says. When people do disclose, it\u2019s for various reasons in different environments. Triggers, such as the #MeToo movement and royal commission, and the desire to obtain justice, are common motives for finally speaking out, she says. It\u2019s especially hard to disclose sex abuse if you\u2019re male. A 2014 paper by Sydney Law School found males are much less likely than females to disclose child sexual abuse at the time it occurs, take longer to disclose, and make fewer and more selective disclosures. Craig Hughes-Cashmore, chief executive of Survivors and Mates Survivors Network, a not-for-profit assisting male survivors of sex abuse, frames the discussion around gender stereotypes: \u201cWomen are victims and men are perpetrators; men don\u2019t cry; men don\u2019t seek help,\u201d he says. The added fear and confusion about sexual preference adds to their silence. \u201cThe bulk of perpetrators are male, so if you\u2019re a boy and are sexually abused by a same-sex person and you have a physical response, you\u2019re left very confused about your sexuality,\u201d he says. Hughes-Cashmore was himself abused as a child. It began in his early teens when his parents were going through a separation and a friend of his father\u2019s moved into the family home. \u201cHe was a friend and a work colleague of my father\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it was nice to get that attention.

Owing to their own sense of shame, many survivors expect judgment from society, he says. One man who found the strength to speak out is Adam Savage. The 40-year-old Newcastle resident was sexually abused by two older teenagers and a Catholic priest. It took him until he was 37 to reveal it. In 2016 Savage drove past his abuser\u2019s house with a friend. \u201cI said, \u2018That was the house where the two brothers abused me,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was really impulsive.

The three individuals stole my power and it was time for me to get my power back. That will form my legacy \u2013 communicating and speaking my truth to empower others.

Here are five we could do now, if we chose.</p> <h2>1. Scale up things that work</h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a knowing problem; it\u2019s very much a doing problem,\u201d says Matthew Cox, the director of Logan Together, a 10-year <a href=\"https://logantogether.org.au/\">community led project</a> with one aim: use the evidence already at hand to give children aged 0 to 8 the best start in life. Why those years? Because the \u201cscience is incredibly clear\u201d that \u201cif the first years of life go well then those little kids turn into teenagers who do well and those teenagers tend to turn into adults who do well\u201d.</p> <p>Logan is a fast-growing city of around 315,000 people about 45 minutes from Brisbane\u2019s city centre. It is well known that poverty is concentrated: in Queensland, for instance, more than half of the most disadvantaged people live in just four places: Logan, Moreton Bay, Bundaberg and Ipswich.</p> <p>Cox outlines the challenge. In Logan, there are about 45,000 children aged 0 to 8. Most of them are doing fine, but about 15,000 are not. It means that, in five suburbs within the city, fewer than 20% attend kindergarten, when the evidence is that formal programs make a big difference to language and social skills when children start school.</p> <p>When Logan Together began in 2015, about 12% of women were receiving little or no antenatal care and between 5% and 6% were turning up to give birth without seeing a doctor at any time during pregnancy. This is in suburban Brisbane, not remote Australia. In some suburbs, between 10% and 20% of children arrived at school never having received a health check.</p> <p>Logan Together is a \u201cmassive collaboration\u201d effort between about 100 organisations \u2013 from schools to churches to local sporting groups to government health centres \u2013 to deliver the few things children need at different stages of early childhood so that they begin life with the same chances as any other Australian child. It\u2019s not a lack of money, with an estimate of more than $200m a year spent in Logan on human and family services alone. Cox calls it a \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach.</p> <p>\u201cYou spray human services out there, and you pray it\u2019s made a difference,\u201d Cox told a <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Intergenerational_Welfare_Dependence\">parliamentary inquiry</a> on intergenerational welfare dependence last year.</p> <p>\u201cWe know it doesn\u2019t. We know those sorts of highly pixilated, atomised, random acts of kindness into the community are actually pretty good at resolving people\u2019s immediate crisis issues. They are really lousy at stitching together into a system that grows kids up well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d59da1e03dcb9b38186c12faf9b64e0f0c2b524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d59da1e03dcb9b38186c12faf9b64e0f0c2b524/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A kindergarten\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In five suburbs within Logan, fewer than 20% attend kindergarten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are dozens of initiatives across Australia that have a similar approach \u2013 long-term, locally organised, working on solutions rather than responding to crisis. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://empoweredcommunities.org.au/media/empowered-communities-take-the-initiative-on-indigenous-funding/\">Empowered Communities</a>, an Indigenous-designed and led model that gives local communities greater authority about priorities for government spending and services. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://ourplace.org.au/\">Doveton</a> in outer Melbourne, a world-leading, philanthropically funded experiment to overcome serious disadvantage through a purpose-built school integrating health and family services. There\u2019s Tasmania\u2019s Child and Family Centres, single entry points to universal, targeted and specialist services and supports from pregnancy to age 5.</p> <p>Cox says Australia needs a radical change in how it delivers services to vulnerable people. The \u201clarge centralised systems we have to deliver health and education but also social services just cannot operate flexibly in a differentiated way at the local level.\u201d</p> <p>Governments of all hues see the need for change. \u201cThis is just good policy and notions of left and right mean absolutely nothing. [But] there is a very a long way to go. This is an enormous paradigm change for how the federation works in Australia, how social investment works.</p> <p>\u201cThe message is that there is a scalable, knowable and plannable response to poverty ... if we apply it to 50 to 100 communities we could make a really significant intergenerational change.</p> <p>\u201cIt sort of seems like we\u2019ve have given up big ideas like that in the modern world, given up on the idea that you can do something conclusive about levels of poverty in this country. What we\u2019re trying to prove is that it\u2019s just not true, we can take action. It\u2019s not a pipe dream. It\u2019s a decision.\u201d</p> <h2>2. Set a target</h2> <p>In February, Canada got good news. Between 2015 and 2017, the poverty rate fell by more than 20%. That meant there were 825,000 fewer Canadians living in poverty. Put another way, <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2019/02/canadas-first-poverty-reduction-target-met-three-years-ahead-of-schedule.html\">Canada now has its lowest poverty rate</a> in its modern history, 9.5%.</p> <p>How did this country, in many ways similar to Australia, achieve this when in many wealthy countries poverty rates remain the same, or rise? It set a target.</p> <p>Prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s progressive government released the country\u2019s first poverty reduction strategy last year. In November, it enshrined it into law. For the first time, Canada has an official poverty line based on the cost of a basket of goods and services people require to meet basic needs and achieve a modest standard of living. (Australia has no official measure of poverty, one reason why the discussion here can be so confusing.)</p> <p>Canada has set targets \u2013 a 20% reduction in poverty by 2020 (it is ahead of that goal), and a 50% drop by 2030, relative to 2015 levels. It set up the independent National Advisory Council on Poverty to advise the government on its strategy, and track efforts through an annual report tabled in parliament.</p> <p>Canada\u2019s economy is doing well, creating jobs. The government has also taken specific steps to reduce poverty, including big increases to child benefits for low-income people with children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a05d2d95912dc5a9a6006537079fd52d2155765d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a05d2d95912dc5a9a6006537079fd52d2155765d/0_0_7680_5120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacinda Ardern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacinda Ardern says she wants New Zealand to \u2018aspire to be the best place in the world to be a child\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>New Zealand is another country setting targets. Last year, it passed the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2018/0057/18.0/LMS8294.html\">Child Poverty Reduction Act</a>, which aims to halve child poverty in 10 years. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, says she wants New Zealand to \u201caspire to be the best place in the world to be a child\u201d. New Zealand\u2019s rate of child poverty is 23% when the cost of housing is taken into account, compared with more than 17% in Australia.</p> <p>The chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Services, Cassandra Goldie, says targets can work to signal a national priority and to keep governments accountable.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t speak for First Nation views around the Close the Gap agenda, but the one thing it clearly has done is helped back up the voices of First Nations communities who say, \u2018See? Things are not changing with the way you mob are doing it\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s the persistent constant monitoring of some of those basic metrics for First Nation communities and we need that as a country.\u201d</p> <h2>3. Fix housing</h2> <p>For a growing number of Australians, housing stress is acute. What\u2019s happened, says Prof Hal Pawson, a housing policy and homelessness specialist at the University of NSW in Sydney, is intertwined with poverty.</p> <p>While some welfare groups argue that \u201canyone\u201d can become homeless if a few things go wrong, it\u2019s not really true. It\u2019s poverty that leads to homelessness.</p> <p>Pawson was the lead author of Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.launchhousing.org.au/site/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LaunchHousing_AHM2018_Report.pdf\">first comprehensive homelessness monitor</a> in 2018, which found that after a decade when homelessness was fairly stable in Australia, it jumped by 14% in the five years to 2016, when 116,000 people were recorded as homeless.</p> <p>The rise didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. It\u2019s the result of lack of affordable housing, especially affordable rents. It is no surprise that the biggest rises in homelessness were in our big cities, where housing affordability has worsened most and where median rents are highest.</p> <p>All this is linked to the rates of social benefits, especially the low rate of Newstart. It is exceptionally hard to rent privately on $277.85 a week, even with the maximum commonwealth rental assistance of $68 a week. Anglicare\u2019s snapshot of advertised affordable rentals this year found just two listings across the country were affordable for the 500,000 single people on Newstart. Even for those on the minimum wage of $719.20 a week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/29/just-two-rentals-in-australia-affordable-for-single-people-on-newstart-report\">fewer than 3% of rental listings were affordable</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"229a6ce78f6f03dba9456ef44eabb526f861e085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/229a6ce78f6f03dba9456ef44eabb526f861e085/0_276_5140_3084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A homeless person\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homelessness jumped by 14% in the five years to 2016, when 116,000 people were recorded as homeless.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Moir/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pawson says these issues are structural \u2013 they are not the individuals\u2019 fault. If the causes are complex, there is one thing we could do now to ease housing stress and homelessness. We could increase rent assistance for those on very low incomes and social security benefits renting in the private market. For many experts and welfare groups, this is at as important as increasing Newstart.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://grattan.edu.au/report/commonwealth-orange-book-2019/\">Grattan Institute\u2019s report</a> before the 18 May election argued for a 40% increase in maximum rent assistance \u2013 worth $1,410 for singles, at a cost of $1.2bn a year. Even that big rise would only provide the same real assistance to low-income earners as it did 15 years ago. Acoss argues for an immediate 30% increase and a review to ensure it meets people\u2019s basic needs across the country.</p> <p>There is broad agreement, too, that rent assistance for people on Newstart, or single parents payments or aged pensions, be indexed to changes in rents, so its value is maintained. For decades, it has been indexed to the CPI, which rents have far outstripped.</p> <p>Where there is debate is around the need for increased direct government investment in social housing, where rent is below market rates. Many low-income people renting privately qualify for social housing but have little to no chance of securing a place.</p> <p>As Grattan and others point out, our stock of social housing \u2013 about 400,000 dwellings \u2013 has barely grown in 20 years, while the population has increased by 33%. So the waiting lists keep growing, those in social housing stay for longer periods, and poorer people find it harder to pay for rents in the private market, many spending half their incomes on rent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A quarter of a century of paltry investment has meant a shortfall of 433,000 social housing dwellings.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Research released last year from the <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/housing-assistance/housing-assistance-in-australia-2018/contents/housing-in-australia\">Australian Housing and Urban Research Centre</a> found that Australia needed to triple its stock of social housing over the next 20 years to cover the existing backlog of people in severe housing need, and to meet emerging needs. A quarter of a century of paltry investment meant a shortfall of 433,000 dwellings and the current construction rate \u2013 little more than 3,000 dwellings a year \u2013 would need to be expanded fivefold just to keep pace with population growth.</p> <p>Pawson sees small signs of optimism. After the \u201cscorched earth\u201d approach of prime minister Tony Abbott \u2013 who saw a minimal role for the commonwealth in housing \u2013 it was Morrison as treasurer who championed federal involvement, setting up the <a href=\"https://nhfic.gov.au/\">National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation</a> (NHFIC) in 2018, to channel lower-cost finance to not-for-profit community housing providers.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough NHFIC could be a game-changer, it can come into its own only when significant matching funds are offered by government,\u201d Pawson says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we will need to see by prime minister Morrison to finish the job started by treasurer Morrison.\u201d</p> <h2>4. Think big</h2> <p>\u201cPoverty isn\u2019t a lack of character, it\u2019s a lack of cash.\u201d</p> <p>One reason why Dutch historian Rutger Bregman\u2019s 2017 book, Utopia for Realists<em>,</em> caused such a stir was that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/13/utopia-realists-how-we-can-get-there-rutger-bregman-review\">challenged the deep assumptions</a> about how wealthy countries think about poverty, and argued for a radical rethink.</p> <p>One of Bregman\u2019s central proposals was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income\">universal basic income</a> (UBI), an idea that has attracted new interest since the global financial crisis as a possible way to counter rising inequality and persistent poverty in an era of insecure work.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/12/labour-would-trial-universal-basic-income-if-elected-john-mcdonnell-says\">Labour has said it would trial a UBI if elected</a>.</p> <p>In Australia, the Greens <a href=\"https://greens.org.au/sites/default/files/2019-03/NSW%20policy%20initiative%20%E2%80%93%20UBI_0.pdf\">support a trial</a> but it has detractors, including among many of Australia\u2019s welfare groups and poverty researchers. There are numerous UBI models but, in essence, it is a guaranteed basic income for all, enough to live on, without conditions or mean testing.</p> <p>In his book, Bregman takes on the often-unspoken thinking about poverty. Anyone who wants to end it, he writes, \u201cmust inevitably face a few tough questions. Why are the poor more likely to commit crimes? Why are they more prone to obesity? Why do they use more alcohol and drugs? In short, why do the poor make so many dumb decisions?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58c0097bef785434f833bc3b783a3c7257a3f199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58c0097bef785434f833bc3b783a3c7257a3f199/0_0_3153_4724/667.jpg\" alt=\"Rutger Bregman\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Dutch historian Rutger Bregman\u2019s central proposals was universal basic income.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirka Laura Severa/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jacqueline Phillips, director of policy and advocacy at Acoss, says our system is riddled with the notion that poverty is the fault of the poor.</p> <p>\u201cThe community sector points to the structural drivers of poverty and disadvantage and others emphasise personal responsibility,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s partly why we\u2019ve ended up with all these programs like income management which are all based on the assumption that individuals on welfare are somehow defective. There\u2019s individual behaviour issues at play and policies are designed to change those behaviours rather than changing the structure.\u201d</p> <p>There is evidence that none of these assumptions is true and that poverty cannot be addressed without changing them. Bregman outlines the theories of Eldar Shafir, a psychologist at Princeton University, and his \u201cscience of scarcity\u201d. Poverty consumes people to such an extent that they can focus only on the short term \u2013 how to pay the rent, how to pay the bills, buying a needed pair of shoes. There\u2019s never a break, never the space to think about the longer term. Poor people \u201care not making dumb decisions because they are dumb, but because they are living in a context in which anyone would make dumb decisions\u201d.</p> <p>Instead of trying to fix behaviour, we could turn that around. One example is known as Housing First \u2013 that the answer to homelessness is not crisis accommodation but a home, without conditions.</p> <p>Finland has proven it. Since the launch of Housing First in 2008, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/03/its-a-miracle-helsinkis-radical-solution-to-homelessness\">the number of long-term homeless people in Finland has fallen</a> by more than 35% and rough sleeping has all but been eliminated. The idea is that people who are homeless don\u2019t have to fix their problems before they get a home. Providing a home gives them the space and security to turn their lives around. It costs money, but over time, it saves money.</p> <p>Bregman and others argue that the UBI could have the same impact. A four-year trial in the Canadian town of Dauphin in the 1970s ensured that no one fell below the poverty line. In practice, 30% of the towns\u2019 residents got a cheque in the mail each month, no questions asked. When it was evaluated \u2013 years later \u2013 it was found that people did not work less. Hospitalisations had dropped. Domestic violence was down, and school performance improved.</p> <p>Emma Dawson, the executive director of progressive thinktank Per Capita, is not a fan of a UBI. The cost would be huge to ensure people did not live below the poverty line, and Dawson believes Australia\u2019s system of targeted assistance to those who need it most is the right structure. What she would like to see, though, is a \u201ca targeted basic income, about making Newstart or youth allowance or disability payment a liveable payment without the massive conditionality that\u2019s attached to it now\u201d.</p> <p>Acoss is open to the debate, and it does propose a root and branch review of the social security system. Phillips says its immediate priority is to secure a basic minimum income for those who need it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Imagine how much energy and talent we would unleash if we got rid of poverty.</p> <footer> <cite>Rutger Bregman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bregman\u2019s book received both praise and criticism, but it was acknowledged that he was at least thinking beyond the next electoral cycle. He did identify that big changes rarely happen without utopian thinking. In a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/rutger_bregman_poverty_isn_t_a_lack_of_character_it_s_a_lack_of_cash?language=en\">recent TED Talk</a>, he said eliminating it was a decision countries could make, if they dared to think boldly enough.</p> <p>\u201cImagine how much energy and talent we would unleash if we got rid of poverty once and for all,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>5. And yes, raise Newstart</h2> <p>Experts say \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 the single biggest thing we could do to reduce income poverty is to increase Newstart and youth allowance (the unemployment benefit for young adults) and index it to rises in average weekly earnings. That\u2019s because the base single rate of $277.85 for Newstart is about $150 a week below the standard income poverty line and more than half its recipients are living in poverty.</p> <p>Because Newstart is indexed to inflation rather than wages (as aged pensions are), it keeps falling relatively backwards, driving especially long-term recipients deeper into poverty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5743e7cf6328a2725c4eaa9c715987f657fbf5bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5743e7cf6328a2725c4eaa9c715987f657fbf5bb/0_70_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cassandra Goldie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, says welfare groups and experts in poverty reduction will keep pushing for a real rise in Newstart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Living costs for those on Newstart are much the same as for those on the aged or disability pension, but the gap between them keeps growing \u2013 the single aged pension rate, for instance, is $422 a week, or around $24,000 a year with allowances such as an energy supplement.</p> <p>Acoss and other welfare groups argue that Newstart needs to be indexed to wage growth.. For instance, New Zealand in its latest budget made a historic change: indexing main benefits such as its job seekers payment to wage growth, not inflation. <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12235576\">That change alone will see weekly increases</a> of $NZ10 to $17 a week.</p> <p>Goldie says welfare groups and experts in poverty reduction will keep pushing for a real rise in the payment \u2013 a minimum of $75 a week.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important that we persist in highlighting where we are succeeding and where we are not,\u201d Goldie says. \u201cThere are ideological views around the way you go about delivering better outcomes for people, but nobody\u2019s going to say we want to increase the number people who don\u2019t have enough food to eat.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The federal election is history, and those who had counted on a Labor government to focus on reducing inequality and easing poverty were disappointed. Scott Morrison\u2019s government has made clear it has no intention of increasing the base rate of the Newstart payment for unemployed Australians \u2013 the most intense welfare campaign of the election \u2013 even though it has seen no real increase for a quarter of a century, and despite suggestions from the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, that an increase would be \u201cgood for the economy\u201d. Yet the 10% of Australians living in income poverty remain (13% if you take the cost of housing into account), with up to a million of us living in persistent and entrenched poverty, unable to participate fully in life. As the Productivity Commission has noted, our poverty rate has remained stubbornly high for 30 years, despite Australia being one of the wealthiest countries in the world and enjoying decades of economic growth. As its former chairman Peter Harris has said: \u201cPerhaps simply shifting money around and doing more of the same is not sufficient.\u201d There are dozens of ideas about what we could do to reduce poverty. Here are five we could do now, if we chose. 1. Scale up things that work \u201cIt\u2019s not a knowing problem; it\u2019s very much a doing problem,\u201d says Matthew Cox, the director of Logan Together, a 10-year community led project with one aim: use the evidence already at hand to give children aged 0 to 8 the best start in life. Why those years? Because the \u201cscience is incredibly clear\u201d that \u201cif the first years of life go well then those little kids turn into teenagers who do well and those teenagers tend to turn into adults who do well\u201d. Logan is a fast-growing city of around 315,000 people about 45 minutes from Brisbane\u2019s city centre. It is well known that poverty is concentrated: in Queensland, for instance, more than half of the most disadvantaged people live in just four places: Logan, Moreton Bay, Bundaberg and Ipswich. Cox outlines the challenge. In Logan, there are about 45,000 children aged 0 to 8. Most of them are doing fine, but about 15,000 are not. It means that, in five suburbs within the city, fewer than 20% attend kindergarten, when the evidence is that formal programs make a big difference to language and social skills when children start school. When Logan Together began in 2015, about 12% of women were receiving little or no antenatal care and between 5% and 6% were turning up to give birth without seeing a doctor at any time during pregnancy. This is in suburban Brisbane, not remote Australia. In some suburbs, between 10% and 20% of children arrived at school never having received a health check. Logan Together is a \u201cmassive collaboration\u201d effort between about 100 organisations \u2013 from schools to churches to local sporting groups to government health centres \u2013 to deliver the few things children need at different stages of early childhood so that they begin life with the same chances as any other Australian child. It\u2019s not a lack of money, with an estimate of more than $200m a year spent in Logan on human and family services alone. Cox calls it a \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach. \u201cYou spray human services out there, and you pray it\u2019s made a difference,\u201d Cox told a parliamentary inquiry on intergenerational welfare dependence last year. \u201cWe know it doesn\u2019t. We know those sorts of highly pixilated, atomised, random acts of kindness into the community are actually pretty good at resolving people\u2019s immediate crisis issues. They are really lousy at stitching together into a system that grows kids up well.\u201d There are dozens of initiatives across Australia that have a similar approach \u2013 long-term, locally organised, working on solutions rather than responding to crisis. There\u2019s Empowered Communities, an Indigenous-designed and led model that gives local communities greater authority about priorities for government spending and services. There\u2019s Doveton in outer Melbourne, a world-leading, philanthropically funded experiment to overcome serious disadvantage through a purpose-built school integrating health and family services. There\u2019s Tasmania\u2019s Child and Family Centres, single entry points to universal, targeted and specialist services and supports from pregnancy to age 5. Cox says Australia needs a radical change in how it delivers services to vulnerable people. The \u201clarge centralised systems we have to deliver health and education but also social services just cannot operate flexibly in a differentiated way at the local level.\u201d Governments of all hues see the need for change. \u201cThis is just good policy and notions of left and right mean absolutely nothing. [But] there is a very a long way to go. This is an enormous paradigm change for how the federation works in Australia, how social investment works. \u201cThe message is that there is a scalable, knowable and plannable response to poverty ... if we apply it to 50 to 100 communities we could make a really significant intergenerational change. \u201cIt sort of seems like we\u2019ve have given up big ideas like that in the modern world, given up on the idea that you can do something conclusive about levels of poverty in this country. What we\u2019re trying to prove is that it\u2019s just not true, we can take action. It\u2019s not a pipe dream. It\u2019s a decision.\u201d 2. Set a target In February, Canada got good news. Between 2015 and 2017, the poverty rate fell by more than 20%. That meant there were 825,000 fewer Canadians living in poverty. Put another way, Canada now has its lowest poverty rate in its modern history, 9.5%. How did this country, in many ways similar to Australia, achieve this when in many wealthy countries poverty rates remain the same, or rise? It set a target. Prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s progressive government released the country\u2019s first poverty reduction strategy last year. In November, it enshrined it into law. For the first time, Canada has an official poverty line based on the cost of a basket of goods and services people require to meet basic needs and achieve a modest standard of living. (Australia has no official measure of poverty, one reason why the discussion here can be so confusing.) Canada has set targets \u2013 a 20% reduction in poverty by 2020 (it is ahead of that goal), and a 50% drop by 2030, relative to 2015 levels. It set up the independent National Advisory Council on Poverty to advise the government on its strategy, and track efforts through an annual report tabled in parliament. Canada\u2019s economy is doing well, creating jobs. The government has also taken specific steps to reduce poverty, including big increases to child benefits for low-income people with children. New Zealand is another country setting targets. Last year, it passed the Child Poverty Reduction Act, which aims to halve child poverty in 10 years. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, says she wants New Zealand to \u201caspire to be the best place in the world to be a child\u201d. New Zealand\u2019s rate of child poverty is 23% when the cost of housing is taken into account, compared with more than 17% in Australia. The chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Services, Cassandra Goldie, says targets can work to signal a national priority and to keep governments accountable. \u201cI won\u2019t speak for First Nation views around the Close the Gap agenda, but the one thing it clearly has done is helped back up the voices of First Nations communities who say, \u2018See? Things are not changing with the way you mob are doing it\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s the persistent constant monitoring of some of those basic metrics for First Nation communities and we need that as a country.\u201d 3. Fix housing For a growing number of Australians, housing stress is acute. What\u2019s happened, says Prof Hal Pawson, a housing policy and homelessness specialist at the University of NSW in Sydney, is intertwined with poverty. While some welfare groups argue that \u201canyone\u201d can become homeless if a few things go wrong, it\u2019s not really true. It\u2019s poverty that leads to homelessness. Pawson was the lead author of Australia\u2019s first comprehensive homelessness monitor in 2018, which found that after a decade when homelessness was fairly stable in Australia, it jumped by 14% in the five years to 2016, when 116,000 people were recorded as homeless. The rise didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. It\u2019s the result of lack of affordable housing, especially affordable rents. It is no surprise that the biggest rises in homelessness were in our big cities, where housing affordability has worsened most and where median rents are highest. All this is linked to the rates of social benefits, especially the low rate of Newstart. It is exceptionally hard to rent privately on $277.85 a week, even with the maximum commonwealth rental assistance of $68 a week. Anglicare\u2019s snapshot of advertised affordable rentals this year found just two listings across the country were affordable for the 500,000 single people on Newstart. Even for those on the minimum wage of $719.20 a week, fewer than 3% of rental listings were affordable. Pawson says these issues are structural \u2013 they are not the individuals\u2019 fault. If the causes are complex, there is one thing we could do now to ease housing stress and homelessness. We could increase rent assistance for those on very low incomes and social security benefits renting in the private market. For many experts and welfare groups, this is at as important as increasing Newstart. The Grattan Institute\u2019s report before the 18 May election argued for a 40% increase in maximum rent assistance \u2013 worth $1,410 for singles, at a cost of $1.2bn a year. Even that big rise would only provide the same real assistance to low-income earners as it did 15 years ago. Acoss argues for an immediate 30% increase and a review to ensure it meets people\u2019s basic needs across the country. There is broad agreement, too, that rent assistance for people on Newstart, or single parents payments or aged pensions, be indexed to changes in rents, so its value is maintained. For decades, it has been indexed to the CPI, which rents have far outstripped. Where there is debate is around the need for increased direct government investment in social housing, where rent is below market rates. Many low-income people renting privately qualify for social housing but have little to no chance of securing a place. As Grattan and others point out, our stock of social housing \u2013 about 400,000 dwellings \u2013 has barely grown in 20 years, while the population has increased by 33%. So the waiting lists keep growing, those in social housing stay for longer periods, and poorer people find it harder to pay for rents in the private market, many spending half their incomes on rent. Research released last year from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Centre found that Australia needed to triple its stock of social housing over the next 20 years to cover the existing backlog of people in severe housing need, and to meet emerging needs. A quarter of a century of paltry investment meant a shortfall of 433,000 dwellings and the current construction rate \u2013 little more than 3,000 dwellings a year \u2013 would need to be expanded fivefold just to keep pace with population growth. Pawson sees small signs of optimism. After the \u201cscorched earth\u201d approach of prime minister Tony Abbott \u2013 who saw a minimal role for the commonwealth in housing \u2013 it was Morrison as treasurer who championed federal involvement, setting up the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) in 2018, to channel lower-cost finance to not-for-profit community housing providers. \u201cAlthough NHFIC could be a game-changer, it can come into its own only when significant matching funds are offered by government,\u201d Pawson says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we will need to see by prime minister Morrison to finish the job started by treasurer Morrison.\u201d 4. Think big \u201cPoverty isn\u2019t a lack of character, it\u2019s a lack of cash.\u201d One reason why Dutch historian Rutger Bregman\u2019s 2017 book, Utopia for Realists, caused such a stir was that it challenged the deep assumptions about how wealthy countries think about poverty, and argued for a radical rethink. One of Bregman\u2019s central proposals was a universal basic income (UBI), an idea that has attracted new interest since the global financial crisis as a possible way to counter rising inequality and persistent poverty in an era of insecure work. In the UK, Labour has said it would trial a UBI if elected. In Australia, the Greens support a trial but it has detractors, including among many of Australia\u2019s welfare groups and poverty researchers. There are numerous UBI models but, in essence, it is a guaranteed basic income for all, enough to live on, without conditions or mean testing. In his book, Bregman takes on the often-unspoken thinking about poverty. Anyone who wants to end it, he writes, \u201cmust inevitably face a few tough questions. Why are the poor more likely to commit crimes? Why are they more prone to obesity? Why do they use more alcohol and drugs? In short, why do the poor make so many dumb decisions?\u201d Jacqueline Phillips, director of policy and advocacy at Acoss, says our system is riddled with the notion that poverty is the fault of the poor. \u201cThe community sector points to the structural drivers of poverty and disadvantage and others emphasise personal responsibility,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s partly why we\u2019ve ended up with all these programs like income management which are all based on the assumption that individuals on welfare are somehow defective. There\u2019s individual behaviour issues at play and policies are designed to change those behaviours rather than changing the structure.\u201d There is evidence that none of these assumptions is true and that poverty cannot be addressed without changing them. Bregman outlines the theories of Eldar Shafir, a psychologist at Princeton University, and his \u201cscience of scarcity\u201d. Poverty consumes people to such an extent that they can focus only on the short term \u2013 how to pay the rent, how to pay the bills, buying a needed pair of shoes. There\u2019s never a break, never the space to think about the longer term. Poor people \u201care not making dumb decisions because they are dumb, but because they are living in a context in which anyone would make dumb decisions\u201d. Instead of trying to fix behaviour, we could turn that around. One example is known as Housing First \u2013 that the answer to homelessness is not crisis accommodation but a home, without conditions. Finland has proven it. Since the launch of Housing First in 2008, the number of long-term homeless people in Finland has fallen by more than 35% and rough sleeping has all but been eliminated. The idea is that people who are homeless don\u2019t have to fix their problems before they get a home. Providing a home gives them the space and security to turn their lives around. It costs money, but over time, it saves money. Bregman and others argue that the UBI could have the same impact. A four-year trial in the Canadian town of Dauphin in the 1970s ensured that no one fell below the poverty line. In practice, 30% of the towns\u2019 residents got a cheque in the mail each month, no questions asked. When it was evaluated \u2013 years later \u2013 it was found that people did not work less. Hospitalisations had dropped. Domestic violence was down, and school performance improved. Emma Dawson, the executive director of progressive thinktank Per Capita, is not a fan of a UBI. The cost would be huge to ensure people did not live below the poverty line, and Dawson believes Australia\u2019s system of targeted assistance to those who need it most is the right structure. What she would like to see, though, is a \u201ca targeted basic income, about making Newstart or youth allowance or disability payment a liveable payment without the massive conditionality that\u2019s attached to it now\u201d. Acoss is open to the debate, and it does propose a root and branch review of the social security system. Phillips says its immediate priority is to secure a basic minimum income for those who need it. Bregman\u2019s book received both praise and criticism, but it was acknowledged that he was at least thinking beyond the next electoral cycle. He did identify that big changes rarely happen without utopian thinking. In a recent TED Talk, he said eliminating it was a decision countries could make, if they dared to think boldly enough. \u201cImagine how much energy and talent we would unleash if we got rid of poverty once and for all,\u201d he said. 5. And yes, raise Newstart Experts say \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 the single biggest thing we could do to reduce income poverty is to increase Newstart and youth allowance (the unemployment benefit for young adults) and index it to rises in average weekly earnings. That\u2019s because the base single rate of $277.85 for Newstart is about $150 a week below the standard income poverty line and more than half its recipients are living in poverty. Because Newstart is indexed to inflation rather than wages (as aged pensions are), it keeps falling relatively backwards, driving especially long-term recipients deeper into poverty. Living costs for those on Newstart are much the same as for those on the aged or disability pension, but the gap between them keeps growing \u2013 the single aged pension rate, for instance, is $422 a week, or around $24,000 a year with allowances such as an energy supplement. Acoss and other welfare groups argue that Newstart needs to be indexed to wage growth.. For instance, New Zealand in its latest budget made a historic change: indexing main benefits such as its job seekers payment to wage growth, not inflation. That change alone will see weekly increases of $NZ10 to $17 a week. Goldie says welfare groups and experts in poverty reduction will keep pushing for a real rise in the payment \u2013 a minimum of $75 a week. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we persist in highlighting where we are succeeding and where we are not,\u201d Goldie says. \u201cThere are ideological views around the way you go about delivering better outcomes for people, but nobody\u2019s going to say we want to increase the number people who don\u2019t have enough food to eat.\u201d",

The miserable conditions did nothing to stop them getting \u201cBonted\u201d in the first quarter, as Marcus Bontempelli helped himself to 11 contested possessions, six clearances and four inside 50s. \u201cHe got us out of the block and set the example in foreign territory,\u201d said Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge said. \u201cHe handled the ball cleanly and gave us the upper hand and it was a huge first quarter from him.\u201d The Bulldogs will need a huge second, third and fourth quarters from him next week if they are to trouble the ladder leaders, who got past Adelaide with little effort on Friday night, although effort is always hard to gauge in a team whose style appears all ease. It appears that Geelong\u2019s biggest threat is its 90s nemesis, the West Coast Eagles. Like those teams of the 90s, these Eagles hold no fears of the MCG, having now won their past five games there after beating Hawthorn by a goal on Saturday afternoon. Luke Shuey certainly holds no fears of playing on the game\u2019s biggest stage, and along with Jack Darling, was ultimately the difference between the two teams, finishing with 20 contested possessions in the wet as well as 11 clearances and nine tackles. In a backline that was missing Jeremy McGovern and Tom Barrass, Eagles coach Adam Simpson may have just found another uncompromising defender in Oscar Allen, after the 20-year-old ran back with the flight of the ball in the last quarter to take a courageous mark, before being the catalyst for Jamie Cripp\u2019s winning goal just a minute shy of the final siren. \u201cHe\u2019s got leadership (written) all over him,\u201d said Simpson of Allen. \u201cHe does the right thing at the right time.\u201d But Simpson\u2019s biggest smile was reserved for the return of ruckman-slash-cult hero Nic Naitanui who returned after missing close to a year following an ACL rupture in Round 17 last year. While only playing for a little more than half of the game and finishing with just six possessions, Naitanui had a game-high 41 hit-outs. But it was those things you can\u2019t measure on a stat sheet that pleased his coach the most. \u201cThere\u2019s intensity, then there\u2019s Nic intensity, and I reckon we saw that once or twice today,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cIn the last quarter, the first bounce or two, we just saw that intensity no one can match and we\u2019ve missed that.\u201d Among most people who love football there is a desire to see some genuine competition for the Cats in the back half of the season. Although with two months to play, there remains plenty of time for other contenders to emerge, including those who have stumbled of late. On that, the last word of the round must go to Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson. \u201cThe capacity to be able to turn things around in this competition is as quick as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d",

It is estimated more than 400m tonnes of coal ash are stored across Australia, increasing by between 10m and 12m tonnes a year.</p> <p>The report says toxins in coal ash have been linked to asthma, heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease and stroke. It cites the US Environmental Protection Agency, which found the risk of public exposure from ash dams can last for decades, peaking <a href=\"http://www.southeastcoalash.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/epa-coal-combustion-waste-risk-assessment.pdf\">78 to 105 years</a> after ash storage begins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"240371e39e9b37e91401a300cd99cf332e124673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/240371e39e9b37e91401a300cd99cf332e124673/0_0_2346_1234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Eraring ash dump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lakeside sport centre was abruptly closed after engineers found it would not be safe if an earthquake collapsed the Eraring ash dump wall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Environmental Justice Australia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It says there have been problems at ash dams in every mainland state, including a history of groundwater or river contamination in Victoria and a failure to line dumps to prevent leaching in the Hunter Valley.</p> <p>Report author Bronya Lipski says the issue has largely flown under the public radar. \u201cGiven the size of them, and the sheer extent of the toxic material they have in them, you would think there would be much greater monitoring and far more information available to the public,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really is a ticking time bomb.\u201d</p> <p>Delta Electricity, which owns Vales Point, rejects this.

      "bodyText": "Soon after Sue Wynn moved up the road from the Vales Point coal power station, on the banks of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales\u2019s Hunter Valley, she started to worry about what the plant was releasing into the environment. Not the carbon dioxide emissions from its smokestacks \u2013 it was 1978, and that disquiet came later \u2013 but the coal ash mixed with water and piped into a giant unlined dam site nearby. \u201cWhat you have is a poisonous slurry containing heavy metals being dumped over virgin soil,\u201d Wynn, a former Wyong councillor for the Greens, says. \u201cMy concern is that it is leaching into the water table and Lake Macquarie and is going to continue to for hundreds of years.\u201d According to research by the Hunter Community Environment Centre, that concern has some basis. It found water and sediment near discharge points from the Vales Point and the Eraring power stations had levels of arsenic, nickel, aluminium, copper and lead that were likely to harm aquatic life. As Wynn notes, Lake Macquarie is a favoured spot for anglers. \u201cMaybe there is not enough there to have an impact on us as humans \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 but bottom feeders will be picking up the mercury and cadmium and that will flow through other animals,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long the fish life can tolerate that before it becomes an issue but it has to be having an effect on marine life.\u201d A new report by Environmental Justice Australia, a not-for-profit legal group formerly known as the Victorian Environment Defenders Office, says Lake Macquarie is an example of a wider problem: poor management of, and limited publicly available information about, health risks associated with ash dams at the country\u2019s coal plants. The findings are dismissed by some in the energy industry, who say the report is part of a long-running campaign to shut down coal-fired electricity due to concern about climate change. While the planet-warming emissions from coal plants are frequently discussed, the ash byproduct is not. It is estimated more than 400m tonnes of coal ash are stored across Australia, increasing by between 10m and 12m tonnes a year. The report says toxins in coal ash have been linked to asthma, heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease and stroke. It cites the US Environmental Protection Agency, which found the risk of public exposure from ash dams can last for decades, peaking 78 to 105 years after ash storage begins. It says there have been problems at ash dams in every mainland state, including a history of groundwater or river contamination in Victoria and a failure to line dumps to prevent leaching in the Hunter Valley. Report author Bronya Lipski says the issue has largely flown under the public radar. \u201cGiven the size of them, and the sheer extent of the toxic material they have in them, you would think there would be much greater monitoring and far more information available to the public,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really is a ticking time bomb.\u201d Delta Electricity, which owns Vales Point, rejects this. It says the Environmental Justice Australia report is misleading and the water sampling it quotes unscientific. Delta secretary Steve Gurney says the company does its own testing in line with Environment Protection Authority methodology and posts the results on its website. \u201cEnvironmental Justice Australia is a group of anti-coal activists with one objective, to shut down coal-fired power stations,\u201d he says. A spokesman for Origin Energy, which owns the Eraring station, says the company takes local environment protection seriously and also does its own water quality monitoring beyond what is required under law. Industry group the Australian Energy Council said it was yet to see the report but it appeared a continuation of a campaign against fossil fuels. \u201cPlant operators work within strict licence limits and these are independently and continuously monitored,\u201d a spokesman says. The risk associated with coal ash dams on the NSW central coast made headlines in March, when a lakeside sport centre was abruptly closed after engineers for Origin found it would not be safe if an earthquake collapsed the Eraring ash dump wall. The Myuna Bay Sports and Recreation Centre remains shut. Environmental Justice Australia says the most poorly constructed ash dams should be moved and the existing sites cleaned up. It says all jurisdictions should introduce bonds to ensure landfill dumps are properly managed. The group wants state parliaments to set-up inquiries to better understand and make public the risk to health and the environment, building on a federal Senate inquiry into commonwealth responsibility for mining rehabilitation last year. And it recommends imposing an immediate obligation on dump owners and operators to convert wet dumps to dry ash landfill and to prepare best practice rehabilitation and closure plans in consultation with affected communities. Wynn, now the secretary of community group Myuna Bay Sports and Recreation Centre, says some people were alarmed when the environment centre published NSW Office of Environment and Heritage data suggesting cadmium levels in Lake Macquarie crabs were too high for consumption. The EPA has advised they are safe to eat in small portions. She hopes to see pollution standards strengthened and wants greater transparency. \u201cQuite frankly, I think the state government should be testing all the fish life, checking if it is safe to eat and we in the community should be informed,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re being kept in the dark.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nigeria, having slumped to second place (ahead of Guinean, who beat Burundi 2-0 thanks to goals by Mohamed Yattara) are now likely to face either Cameroon or Ghana in the next round. Who would they prefer? \u201cNeither\u201d writes Adesegun Agbebiyie. \u201cThis Nigeria team is so Jekyll and Hyde. Can be so frustrating watching the conservative approach of the coach backfire. I\u2019m sick to my stomach. But I imagine it\u2019s more likely to be Ghana. Cameroon certainly the stronger team given their games so far. So to answer your question...I\u2019m looking forward to a game against Ghana with dread.\u201d Before today Madagascar had never even scored against the Super Eagles, now they have beaten them in style! Nigeria were outfought, outthought and outplayed, and Madagascar finish top of the group in their first ever appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations! It\u2019s a sensation and they celebrate accordingly! 90 min: There will be at least three more minutes. At this rate Nigeria could play for another six hours without creating anything. 89 min: Nigeria work Musa into a fine crossing position... and he sends it straight to the goalkeeper. Just awful. 89 min: immaculate defending by Randrianarisoa, who has replaced Razak well since coming on. 88 min: A shoddy pass by Aina is intercepted, and Madagascar tear forward. They\u2019re relentless enterprise and energy make them terrific fun to watch. 87 min: Aina floats a cross over from the left. Ighalo gets his head to it but can only glance it wide from 10 yards. Madagascar substitution: Raveloson on, Amada off. 84 min: Ilaimaharitra gets a severe bollocking from the referee, who jabs an angry finger towards him as he warns him that he\u2019s perilously close for a red card. Presumably the Maglasy said something irksome, because the freekick is Madagascar\u2019s. 83 min: Nigeria are going nowhere fast. Madagascar are not going to be denied the greatest win in their history. 81 min: Iwobi does well to win back the ball wide on the right. Ilaimaharitra resorts to a foul to stop the counter-attack. He gets as booking that rules him out of the next match. He\u2019ll be a big loss for Madagascar. Can can Nigeria exact retribution from the freekick? No, because Etebo tonks it into the wall. 79 min: Terrific tackle by Randrianarisoa to thwart a Nigeria attack. 78 min: Andriamahitsinoro leads a rare breakaway and wins a corner, which they waste. 77 min: Madagascar have been forced to curb their attacking enthusiasm and concentrate on keeping the Super Eagles at bay. They\u2019re being helpd by Nigeri\u2019s lack of precision when it really matters. 75 min: A bad Nigerian corner is headed gratefully to safety. Madagascar substitution: Many (Randrianarisoa) on, Razak off. Nigeria substitution: Simon on, Kalu off. 71 min: Razak goes down with a knock. On comes the medic with the magic spray. Meanwhile, Gernot Rohr uses the pause to shout instructions at his players. \u201cPlay better!\u201d seems to be the gist of it. 68 min: \u201cThe pressure is mounting from Nigeria. Razak does well to nudge Ighalo off the ball as he tried to wind up a shot after a nice pass by Musa. \u201cAre you using function keys or cut and paste for putting in all those long names or are you typing them out in full every time?!\u201d demands-to-know Sue Hiscock. \u201chope they keep the score as is, anyway.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you how happy I was when Gros was subbed on. 67 min: Super Eagles fans, assuming your team doesn\u2019t storm back in the last 20 minutes, who would you prefer to face in the next round: Cameroon or Ghana? 66 min: Gros fouls Etebo in a dangerous position. Nigeria have the freekick some 23 yards out, quite central. Etebo fancies taking it himself. And he curls it a yard wide of the post. 64 min: Awazien provides an overlap down the right. Ighalo picks him out. But Razak clears the incoming cross. 63 min: Good work by Iwobi down the left, but none of his teammates react sharply enough when he delivers a useful cross. Madagascar have been snappier from the start. Madagascar substitution: Gros on, Andriatsima off. 61 min: Melvin flaps at a cross from the right by Kalu. Ndidi tries to sent the ball back into the net with a volley from 12 yards. But he mis-hits it, swiping well off the target. Nigeria substitution: Iwobi on, Mikel off. Iwobi has had a good tournament so far and his country badly need his creativity here. 58 min: No question of Madagasccar just sitting on their two-goal lead. They want more! And Andriamahitsinoro is leading the charge, jinking down the right before hanging up an inviting cross. Razak nearly pokes it over the line during the ensuing scramble in the Nigeria box, but Ezenwa eventually drops on the ball. 57 min: Ndidi does well to win the ball as it pinnpongs around the Malgasay box. Then he makes space to curl a shot towards goal from 13 yards. It\u2019s held by Melvin, but at least Nigeria can say they\u2019ve had a shot on target now. 54 min: Madagascar are darn near showboating now. There\u2019s certainly new groove in their stride as they pass and move around their illustrious, lubberly opponents. Nigeria have a heck of a job on to get back into this. Ndidi concedes a freekick in promising position for Madagascar, about 28.4 yards out and a little to the left. Andriamahitsinoro steps up and sends a curling shot into the top corner thanks to a big deflection off the hapless Ndidi! Madagascar are two up, and their coaching staff join in the goal celebrations in a mass huddle! 50 min: Nigeria try unpicking the Malgasay defence centrally, then give up and spin the ball wide to Aina, whose cross from the left goes straight to Mevlin. \u201cSorry,\u201d says Matt Dony [see 30 mins] .\u201dAre you suggesting that people should actually call their friends? You\u2019re a psychopath.\u201d Come now, people don\u2019t jsut have phones to take photos of themselves. Erm, right? 49 min: Amada spreads a beautiful ball wide to the far side, where M\u00e9tanire gets it quickly under control and then plays in a dangerous cross. Ezenwa rushes off his line to intercept. 47 min: Kalu leads a Nigeria counter-attack, which peters out as Madagascar retreat fast and shore up all openings. 46 min: Off we go again. Rohr made one change, introducing Wilfried Ndidi for Ogu in an effort to gain more control in midfield. Etebo has been good in there but that hasn\u2019t been enough. In the group\u2019s other game, Guinea remain 1-0 up on Burundi. Madagascar, who had never even scored against the Super Eagles before today, have a thoroughly deserved lead. As things stand, they will top their group at their first appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations. They are very well organised, vibrant and ambitious and they have made a rejigged Nigeria side look disjointed and a little bit clueless. This is sensational from Madagascar, unacceptable from Nigeria. Big half ahoy! 45 min: Awazien spanks an attempted through-ball straight out of play. Their approach work has been way below par today. Iwobi and Chukwueze may well be introduced at the break. 44 min: Lovely interplay by Madagascar, picking their way nimbly through the Super Eagles defence.At the edge of the box Andriamahitsinoro slips a dainty pass through to Andriatsima, who blasts into the sidenetting 16 yards. It would have been a super goal. 42 min: In the other game in this group, Mohamed Yattara has put Guinea 1-0 up on Burundi. That would probably be enough to send them through as one of the best third-placed teams if the score stays the same here. 39 min: Etebo curls a nice freekick from 40 yards into the danger zone. Many challenge for it but none connect, leaving the ball to bounce wide of the far post. 37 min: Aina flings a long throw to the edge of the six-yard box. Melvin comes and meets it with a flimsy punch when he could easily have caught it. Luckily for him, his defenders tidy up. 36 min: Nigeria knock the ball around in their own half. but Madagascar, organised and hard-working, are giving them no easy route forward and the Super Eagles look short of ideas. And Madagascar are primed to exploit the slightest mistake... 34 min: Andriamahitsinoro sends an outswinging corner towards the near post, where Fontaine headbutts many yards wide. 30 min: Madagascar play themselves into trouble at the back and Nigeria move quickly to punish them, pinging the ball across to Musa near the penalty spot. The goalkeeper flies out at the striker, who sidesteps him swiftly but, in doing so, loses the ball to a defender. The keeper\u2019s speed saved Madagascar there. \u201cI think we\u2019re largely above \u2018shout-outs\u2019 on the MBM, but I have a friend living in Madagascar who follows sport on the Guardian and occasionally gives me grief for the humorous(!) missives that I pepper you guys with,\u201d ingratiates matt Dony. \u201cBut, can I just say a big \u2018Hi, Chris! Hope Madagascar close out the win!\u2019\u201d Anyone else want to say hello to a friend and too cheap to pick up a phone? 28 min: if Nigeria lose top spot in this group, they could face Ghana or Cameroon in the next round, a far more difficult proposition than the one they would get as group winners (in which case they would face a team that finished third). So they\u2019d best get their act together. 26 min: Madagascar have been the better side since taking the lead, far more fluent than their disjointed opponents. 24 min: Madagascar pounce on more Nigerian sloppiness, then rip forward. Mombris pulls a good bckk back from the byline but Amada doesn\u2019t make a clean connection, stabbing wide from 10 yards. 23 min: Etebo does well to escape three opponents on the edge of his own area. They don\u2019t have swarm around players, these dynamic Malgasy. 22 min: If Nigeria pressed as well as Madagascar did for their goal, the they, too, could nick one. Because Madagascar are determined to keep playing out from the back in dicey fashion. 20 min: Musa, picking up the ball in the pocket, darts towards the Madagascan box before shifting the ball wide to Kalu, coming in on the right. Kalu\u2019s shot doesn\u2019t bend as much as he anticipated, missing the target by at least five yards. 18 min: Fontaine steps in to take the ball of Kalu with ease at the edge of the Madagascan area. 17 min: The passing in this game is sketchy by both sides. 15 min: Inflated by the goal, Madagascar are playing with fresh verve. Nigeria looked so comfortable early (lulled into fake security, as it turned out) but they\u2019re frazzled. Madagascar have the lead and their first ever goal against Nigeria! It came from dynamic pressing and dozy Nigerian defending, as Balogun was caught in possession by Nomenjanahary at the edge of his own box. The forward than danced coolly past the keeper and rolled into the net. It\u2019s a sensation! 12 min: Ilaimaharitra goes on a good run through midfield before being pulled back, earning a freekick for Madagascar. 11 min: Andriamahitsinoro catches Mikel with a late tackle near half-way. Nigeria are just a little too slick for Madagascar at the moment. 9 min: Razak concedes a freekick in a dangerous position by clonking into Ighalo from behind. Madagascar erect a four-man wall. Musa curls it over them ... and over the bar. 7 min: Just as Madagascar brightened up and made a move into Nigerian territory, they were robbed of possession and looked vulnerable to a counter-attack. but Mikel gives them a reprieve with a shoddy attempted through-ball. 5 min: It\u2019s all Nigeria so far. Madagascar can\u2019t get out of their own half at the moment. 3 min: The Super Eagles threaten for the first time. Awaziem clips a cross towards the back post, where Mikel jumps for it. Under pressure he can only head up in the air, but when the ball drops he tries to steer it towards goals. Fontaine makes a good block. 1 min: Nigeria get the game going. The first minute goes by at a very leisurely pace. It\u2019s mighty hot out there. Before kickoff there is a a minute\u2019s silence in memory of the people who died at the independence day concert at the Mahamasina stadium last week. The Nigerian anthem is a more solemn affair, and the players look as earnest as they can. The Madagascan players turn sideways to face an empty stand as their national anthem is played. There\u2019s no lack of gusto in their signing, though. The stakes are still high in this group\u2019s other game: Guinea could still nick second spot in the group with a big win, while Burundi have a shot at third place and, even if that is a remote possibility, will be aiming to ensure they leave their first Afcon with a wain, at least. There\u2019s no place in the starting lineup for Saido Berahino for them. Burundi: Nahimana; Nizigiyimana, Ngandu, Nsabiyumva, Nduwarugira; Bigirimana, Kwizera; Shabani, Mustafa, Amissi; Abdul Razak Guinea: Kon\u00e9; Dryestam, Seka, Falette, Sylla; Ciss\u00e9, Diawara; Yattara, Kamano, Traor\u00e9; Kaba Referee: N El-Jaafari (Morocco) Gernot Rohr has made six changes to the Suepr Eagles\u2019 starting lineup, whereas Nicolas Dupuis has decided not to tinker with a winning formula, sticking with the same 11 who began their historic 1-0 win over Burundi. Madagascar: Melvin; M\u00e9tanire, Mombris, Razakanantenaina, Fontaine; Ilaimaharita, Andrianantenaina, Nomenjanahary, Amada, ; Andriamahitsinoro, Andriatsima, Subs: Dabo, Rakotoharisoa, Randrianarisoa, Caloin, Andrinarimanana, Raktoharimalala, Voavy, Morel, Randrianasolo, Rambeloson, Raveloson, Gros Nigeria: Ezenwa; Awaziem, Balogun, Ekong, Aina; Etebo, Ogu, Mikel, Kalu, Musa; Ighalo Subs: Collins, Ndidi, Onyekuru, Chukwuezze, Onuachu, Simon, Akpeyi, Iwobi, Osimhen, Omeruo, Uzoho Referee: B Gassama (Gambia) Hello and welcome and let\u2019s hope yesterday was a freakish off-day. The 2019 Afcon had been going along nicely until Saturday\u2019s trio of gruelling 0-0 draws. For today the signs are promising: Zimbabwe and DR Congo have to go each other like mighty warriors and leopards because each has to win to have any chance of advancing to the next stages. Meanwhile, humble Madagascar are already assured of going beyond the group stages at their first ever appearance in the finals but can go through as group winners if they add to their exploits by beating Nigeria, no less.

In the case of Northern Ireland in 1921, the pressure was partition.

By mid-afternoon on Sunday, when morale is low, songs you know as intimately as your parents\u2019 phone number, played by icons who are very often older than your parents, offer a particularly welcome kind of comfort. But with Kylie, it\u2019s different. She was supposed to play Glastonbury in 2005, she reminds us, back when she was a regular icon, perhaps not yet a living legend. But then, she says, \u201ccircumstances\u201d struck: she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to watch from her bed in Australia, moved by the sight of some bands covering her songs in tribute.</p> <p>She cries as she tells this story, but doesn\u2019t mention cancer explicitly \u2013 an omission that reflects how incongruous this dark moment was in her world. Kylie was about lightness, about transcending time\u2019s limitations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/mar/28/stock-aitken-waterman-mike-hit-factory-pop-songwriters-kylie\">Stock Aitken Waterman</a> pop stars weren\u2019t built to last, let alone evolve beautifully through decades\u2019 worth of shifts in the fabric of pop and experience second, third, fourth heydays.

One of the artists who covered her at the festival in 2005 was Coldplay, and she brings Chris Martin on to perform with her. Worryingly, he\u2019s carrying an acoustic guitar, another thing that frankly has no place in Kylie\u2019s gloriously ritzy world. They proceed to perform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/29/kylie-minogue-cant-get-you-out-of-my-head-australian-anthem\">Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head</a> \u2013 one of the 21st century\u2019s most futuristic pop songs \u2013 in a stripped-back style.

Dancers in pastel trousers waggle 7ft-tall letters spelling out her name during I Should Be So Lucky, then she brings out a man dressed as Klaus Nomi, the German-via-New York performance artist who died of aids in 1983, and they dance tenderly on Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi and Hand on Your Heart. It\u2019s all as silly \u2013 she adds a Chic-style \u201cChoo-choo, beep beep\u201d breakdown to The Locomotion \u2013 as it is sexy. During Slow, revamped as a bassy, throbbing club track fit for the festival\u2019s queer haven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/nyc-downlow-glastonbury-celebration-50-years-lgbt-culture\">NYC Downlow</a>, she interpolates the lascivious riff from Bowie\u2019s Fashion and grinds against the microphone in a manner that raises the already significant temperature.

      "bodyText": "The \u201clegends\u201d slot at Glastonbury is always a fount of audience goodwill. By mid-afternoon on Sunday, when morale is low, songs you know as intimately as your parents\u2019 phone number, played by icons who are very often older than your parents, offer a particularly welcome kind of comfort. But with Kylie, it\u2019s different. She was supposed to play Glastonbury in 2005, she reminds us, back when she was a regular icon, perhaps not yet a living legend. But then, she says, \u201ccircumstances\u201d struck: she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to watch from her bed in Australia, moved by the sight of some bands covering her songs in tribute. She cries as she tells this story, but doesn\u2019t mention cancer explicitly \u2013 an omission that reflects how incongruous this dark moment was in her world. Kylie was about lightness, about transcending time\u2019s limitations. Stock Aitken Waterman pop stars weren\u2019t built to last, let alone evolve beautifully through decades\u2019 worth of shifts in the fabric of pop and experience second, third, fourth heydays. That this was under threat in 2005 didn\u2019t compute, to the degree that it felt like a national crisis in her adoptive home land. Thank god, she survived, and made it to Glastonbury 14 years after her initial appointment and to a hero\u2019s welcome. One of the artists who covered her at the festival in 2005 was Coldplay, and she brings Chris Martin on to perform with her. Worryingly, he\u2019s carrying an acoustic guitar, another thing that frankly has no place in Kylie\u2019s gloriously ritzy world. They proceed to perform Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head \u2013 one of the 21st century\u2019s most futuristic pop songs \u2013 in a stripped-back style. While tantamount to forsaking her official gay icon status, the goodwill and charm of the moment carries them through. Fortunately, the rest of the set is solid gold unadulterated Kylie: that peerless mix of total sincerity and fierce camp that she\u2019s been serving up for more than 30 years. Dancers in pastel trousers waggle 7ft-tall letters spelling out her name during I Should Be So Lucky, then she brings out a man dressed as Klaus Nomi, the German-via-New York performance artist who died of aids in 1983, and they dance tenderly on Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi and Hand on Your Heart. It\u2019s all as silly \u2013 she adds a Chic-style \u201cChoo-choo, beep beep\u201d breakdown to The Locomotion \u2013 as it is sexy. During Slow, revamped as a bassy, throbbing club track fit for the festival\u2019s queer haven NYC Downlow, she interpolates the lascivious riff from Bowie\u2019s Fashion and grinds against the microphone in a manner that raises the already significant temperature. Nick Cave comes on for Where the Wild Roses Grow, and they share a similarly potent, intimate embrace. The showmanship, the incredible run of hits \u2013 it is absolutely phenomenal. So much so that the crowd keep bursting into chants of \u201cKylie! Kylie!\u201d and bringing her to tears. Never mind the legends slot; next stop, headliner.",

These doctors are referring growing numbers of patients because understaffing and the soaring demand for care means the NHS is struggling to treat people quickly enough.</p> <p>Another 177 medical consultants own equipment in private hospitals such as CT scanners and lasers, 67 of whom earn a fee each time it is used, according to a study of links between NHS doctors in England and the private sector by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI). Overall 548 senior NHS doctors own shares or equipment or both.</p> <p>David Rowland, the thinktank\u2019s director and author of the report, said the existence of such financial relationships \u2013 most of which are hidden from public view \u2013 give the doctors concerned a direct financial incentive to refer patients to a private hospital for treatment they do not need.</p> <p>In the most notorious case of that scenario, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/13/victims-of-rogue-breast-surgeon-ian-paterson-to-be-compensated-from-37m-fund\">disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson</a> referred 750 patients from Solihull hospital, part of what was the Heart of England NHS trust, where he worked on to private hospitals at which he performed operations. He earned fees for performing unnecessary surgical procedures on patients, including mastectomies, after exaggerating or inventing symptoms to persuade the women that they had breast cancer. His victims described him as a \u201cmonster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe prevalence of financial incentives in the English healthcare system is first and foremost a patient safety risk,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cIf doctors stand to gain financially from treating patients this can influence their clinical decision-making. Patients are therefore at risk of receiving treatment which is unnecessary and harmful.\u201d</p> <p>NHS trusts have paid at least \u00a340m to 11 private hospitals in which some of their own consultants own shares, according to CHPI\u2019s findings. Its report is based on analysis of declarations about share and equipment ownership that private health firms are legally obliged to make, accounts lodged at Companies House, NHS trusts\u2019 financial reports and freedom of information requests.</p> <p>NHS trusts are sending growing numbers of their own patients to be treated in private hospitals because their own services are so busy that they cannot treat them themselves. Much of that involves surgery for hernia repairs, hip and knee replacements or eye conditions. Trusts pay for privately provided care from their own budgets, though the sums private operators can charge is capped. The care is usually provided by NHS doctors doing private work in their own time.</p> <p>Trusts spent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsc-annual-report-and-accounts-2017-to-2018\">\u00a31.1bn in 2017-18 paying for NHS patients</a> to be treated by private firms, the department of health and social care\u2019s last annual report showed. That sum has increased in recent years as the number of patients waiting for planned care at at NHS hospitals has risen, now standing at a record 4.4 million people. The increasing outsourcing of care has prompted concern among NHS campaigners and the Labour party.</p> <p>In a recent example of the trend, <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/commercial/ft-outsources-more-than-100-patients-to-private-sector-for-chemotherapy/7025367.article\">Northumbria Healthcare NHS trust</a> signed a contract with the Rutherford Cancer Centre (<a href=\"https://www.therutherford.com/centres/north-east/\">https://www.therutherford.com/centres/north-east/</a>) in Bedlington, Northumberland, for it to provide chemotherapy to between 120 and 150 people who have cancer. Sir Jim Mackey, the trust\u2019s chief executive, told the Health Service Journal: \u201cNo one wants to wait for treatment, especially when they have been diagnosed with cancer. Working with the Rutherford Cancer Centre will ensure our patients get timely access and state-of-the-art treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Some NHS trusts have entered into a joint venture with a private company to set up a profit-making private facility to which they refer patients and at which some of their leading doctors also work, the CHPI report discloses. For example, the Christie hospital in Manchester, one of the NHS\u2019s specialist cancer hospitals, co-owns the private patient unit it created in partnership with the US-owned private operator <a href=\"https://www.hcahealthcare.co.uk/facilities/leaders-in-oncology-care/contact-us/loc-at-christie-private-care\">HCA Healthcare</a>, called LOC@The Christie LLP. One in five of the trust\u2019s oncologists own shares in that unit, and \u2013 with the Christie and HCA Healthcare \u2013 share in the profits it makes, Rowland found.</p> <p>Share-owning Christie consultants were entitled to \u00a32.35m in dividends of the overall \u00a322.6m in dividends generated in 2013-17, on top of their NHS and private earnings, Rowland estimates.</p> <p>In a similar arrangement, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS trust pays for patients with musculoskeletal conditions to be treated at the <a href=\"https://www.claremont-hospital.co.uk/patient-information/nhs-patients-e-referral-choose-book/\">Claremont Private Hospital</a>, in which Sheffield Orthopaedics Ltd \u2013 in which many of its own consultants own shares \u2013 has a 10% stake. Records show that the trust paid Claremont \u00a316.3m between 2015/16 and 2017/18 and its referrals accounted for 30% of the private hospital\u2019s overall income, Rowland said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/nhs-england-ban-gps-advertising-private-services\">NHS England to ban GPs from advertising private services</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m appalled that so many consultants have shares in private hospitals they work in. This is clearly a conflict of interest and totally unethical\u201d, said Deborah Douglas, one of Paterson\u2019s victims. \u201cIt encourages consultants to look at patients as cash machines and not people\u201d.</p> <p>But Neil Priestly, the Sheffield trust\u2019s finance director, said that the Claremont is only one of six other hospitals that its patients can end up being treated at and that its consultants have no say in which one provides the care.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the systems we have in place [consultants] cannot influence where patients go to have treatment and they do not have any involvement in the decision-making or management of the contracts. There is a clear separation. We are legally obliged to offer patients a choice of where they want to be treated and we have six hospital choices, only one of which is Claremont hospital and the work is less than 0.5% of our total activity,\u201d said Priestly.</p> <p>Peter Walsh, chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said the CHPI\u2019s findings showed that better regulation of private healthcare was needed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/10/private-hospitals-must-share-more-data-with-nhs-says-top-surgeon\">Private hospitals must share more data with NHS, says top surgeon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Private health firms have also spent at least \u00a31.5m on treating NHS consultants to trips to Wimbledon, cricket matches and golf tournaments, Rowland also discovered. Such gifts included a hospitality package to an England-West Indies cricket match that cost \u00a31,068.</p> <p>The Christie declined to respond to the CHPI\u2019s findings. It said only that the true proportion of its oncologists who own shares in its joint venture with HCA was more likely to be under 10%, rather than the 20% which Rowland stated. But the Christie defended its ties with HCA Healthcare to Rowland. It explained that it \u201centered into the joint venture arrangements as we saw that there was a big market potential to develop private patient services. The development is important for the Christie as [the profit from] it makes a significant contribution towards our NHS services.\u201d</p>",

David Rowland, the thinktank\u2019s director and author of the report, said the existence of such financial relationships \u2013 most of which are hidden from public view \u2013 give the doctors concerned a direct financial incentive to refer patients to a private hospital for treatment they do not need. In the most notorious case of that scenario, disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson referred 750 patients from Solihull hospital, part of what was the Heart of England NHS trust, where he worked on to private hospitals at which he performed operations. He earned fees for performing unnecessary surgical procedures on patients, including mastectomies, after exaggerating or inventing symptoms to persuade the women that they had breast cancer. His victims described him as a \u201cmonster\u201d. \u201cThe prevalence of financial incentives in the English healthcare system is first and foremost a patient safety risk,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cIf doctors stand to gain financially from treating patients this can influence their clinical decision-making. Patients are therefore at risk of receiving treatment which is unnecessary and harmful.\u201d NHS trusts have paid at least \u00a340m to 11 private hospitals in which some of their own consultants own shares, according to CHPI\u2019s findings. Its report is based on analysis of declarations about share and equipment ownership that private health firms are legally obliged to make, accounts lodged at Companies House, NHS trusts\u2019 financial reports and freedom of information requests. NHS trusts are sending growing numbers of their own patients to be treated in private hospitals because their own services are so busy that they cannot treat them themselves. Much of that involves surgery for hernia repairs, hip and knee replacements or eye conditions. Trusts pay for privately provided care from their own budgets, though the sums private operators can charge is capped. The care is usually provided by NHS doctors doing private work in their own time. Trusts spent \u00a31.1bn in 2017-18 paying for NHS patients to be treated by private firms, the department of health and social care\u2019s last annual report showed. That sum has increased in recent years as the number of patients waiting for planned care at at NHS hospitals has risen, now standing at a record 4.4 million people. The increasing outsourcing of care has prompted concern among NHS campaigners and the Labour party. In a recent example of the trend, Northumbria Healthcare NHS trust signed a contract with the Rutherford Cancer Centre (https://www.therutherford.com/centres/north-east/) in Bedlington, Northumberland, for it to provide chemotherapy to between 120 and 150 people who have cancer. Sir Jim Mackey, the trust\u2019s chief executive, told the Health Service Journal: \u201cNo one wants to wait for treatment, especially when they have been diagnosed with cancer. Working with the Rutherford Cancer Centre will ensure our patients get timely access and state-of-the-art treatment.\u201d Some NHS trusts have entered into a joint venture with a private company to set up a profit-making private facility to which they refer patients and at which some of their leading doctors also work, the CHPI report discloses. For example, the Christie hospital in Manchester, one of the NHS\u2019s specialist cancer hospitals, co-owns the private patient unit it created in partnership with the US-owned private operator HCA Healthcare, called LOC@The Christie LLP. One in five of the trust\u2019s oncologists own shares in that unit, and \u2013 with the Christie and HCA Healthcare \u2013 share in the profits it makes, Rowland found. Share-owning Christie consultants were entitled to \u00a32.35m in dividends of the overall \u00a322.6m in dividends generated in 2013-17, on top of their NHS and private earnings, Rowland estimates. In a similar arrangement, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS trust pays for patients with musculoskeletal conditions to be treated at the Claremont Private Hospital, in which Sheffield Orthopaedics Ltd \u2013 in which many of its own consultants own shares \u2013 has a 10% stake. Records show that the trust paid Claremont \u00a316.3m between 2015/16 and 2017/18 and its referrals accounted for 30% of the private hospital\u2019s overall income, Rowland said. \u201cI\u2019m appalled that so many consultants have shares in private hospitals they work in. This is clearly a conflict of interest and totally unethical\u201d, said Deborah Douglas, one of Paterson\u2019s victims. \u201cIt encourages consultants to look at patients as cash machines and not people\u201d. But Neil Priestly, the Sheffield trust\u2019s finance director, said that the Claremont is only one of six other hospitals that its patients can end up being treated at and that its consultants have no say in which one provides the care. \u201cBecause of the systems we have in place [consultants] cannot influence where patients go to have treatment and they do not have any involvement in the decision-making or management of the contracts. There is a clear separation. We are legally obliged to offer patients a choice of where they want to be treated and we have six hospital choices, only one of which is Claremont hospital and the work is less than 0.5% of our total activity,\u201d said Priestly. Peter Walsh, chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said the CHPI\u2019s findings showed that better regulation of private healthcare was needed. Private health firms have also spent at least \u00a31.5m on treating NHS consultants to trips to Wimbledon, cricket matches and golf tournaments, Rowland also discovered. Such gifts included a hospitality package to an England-West Indies cricket match that cost \u00a31,068. The Christie declined to respond to the CHPI\u2019s findings. It said only that the true proportion of its oncologists who own shares in its joint venture with HCA was more likely to be under 10%, rather than the 20% which Rowland stated. But the Christie defended its ties with HCA Healthcare to Rowland. It explained that it \u201centered into the joint venture arrangements as we saw that there was a big market potential to develop private patient services. The development is important for the Christie as [the profit from] it makes a significant contribution towards our NHS services.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Something is stirring in Canada and it has nothing to do with flying hockey pucks or angry bears. Almost from nowhere tennis is buzzing on the big screens in the sports bars of major cities and in the hundreds of indoor courts across the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhenever anyone would think of Canada,\u201d says Denis Shapovalov, \u201cit was always, like, it\u2019s a hockey country. But now it\u2019s a tennis country. It\u2019s great for every one of us but it\u2019s great for the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>This, though, is more than a tennis story. The Canadians who have been making global noise in tennis in recent years all owe something to the country\u2019s welcoming embrace of immigrants \u2013 in contrast to what is happening south of their border. They are an asset not a liability because of an enlightened immigration policy.</p> \n<p>Milos Raonic\u2019s parents came from Serbia as engineers. Vasek Pospisil\u2019s parents are refugees from Czechoslovakia, via Austria. The parents of Bianca Andreescu, the outrageously gifted 19-year-old, were also engineers, arriving in Canada from Romania. Shapovalov\u2019s parents settled in Vaughan, Ontario, after coming from the former Soviet Union via Israel; F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime is the son of a coach who left Togo to settle with relief and optimism in L\u2019Ancienne-Lorette, a suburb of Quebec City.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/prodigy-cori-gauff-15-ready-to-make-her-wimbledon-mark-tennis\">Prodigy Cori Gauff, 15, ready to make her Wimbledon mark</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Raonic and Pospisil have already made their mark in the men\u2019s game while Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov are among the leaders of the new wave injecting excitement into a sport that has become mesmerised by the hegemony of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Over the next fortnight at Wimbledon we will see how far their talent takes them.</p> \n<p>Auger-Aliassime, at 18 years and 10 months, is the youngest player in the men\u2019s draw; he is first to wave the Maple Leaf \u2013 against Pospisil, as it happens \u2013 second up on Court 12 on Monday. They are followed by Raonic against India\u2019s Prajnesh Gunneswaran. The second youngest player in the draw is Shapovalov, at 20 years and two months, and he plays on Tuesday, against the Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis.</p> \n<p>The internal debate is who will make it first: Auger-Aliassime or Shapovalov? Whoever it is, he will have the support of the other.</p> \n<p>Shapovalov sounds very much the older brother as he observes, \u201cIt\u2019s always a lot of fun to play with him. There is rivalry, of course, but it\u2019s healthy. The most important thing is we wish the best for each other and we\u2019re really good friends, really close.\u201d</p> \n<p>During his run to the semi\u2011finals of the Montreal Masters in 2017 Shapovalov slept in Auger\u2011Aliassime\u2019s basement; before he beat Nadal in the third round he ripped the Spaniard\u2019s poster from the wall. There is respect, and there is attitude. These players have both.</p> \n<p>Auger-Aliassime has earned $1m this year alone, $1.4m since he joined the Tour. Shapovalov is not far behind this season, with $853,277 \u2013 and, longer on the Tour, has career earnings of $3.25m.</p> \n<p>And consider this: Federer, in his first five matches against top-20 opponents, won only once; in Auger\u2011Aliassime\u2019s first five matches against top-20 players, he did not drop a set, beating Lucas Pouille, 6-4, 6-3, Fabio Fognini 6-2, 6-3, Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2, Nikoloz Basilashvili 7-6 (4), 6-4, and Borna Coric 7-6 (2), 6-2. Only four players have won three titles before they were 17: Richard Gasquet, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, Djokovic \u2013 and Auger-Aliassime.</p> \n<p>He was the youngest player, at 17, to break into the top 100 since Nadal in 2002. Right now he is not only the youngest player in that group but seeded 21 at Wimbledon and about to scare the living daylights out of some of the seeded stars in his quarter of the draw, including Djokovic, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Daniil Medvedev, Kyle Edmund and Tsitsipas.</p> \n<p>To listen to him talk about his origins is to hear wisdom beyond his years. \u201cMy father, Sam, came to Canada from Togo when he was 26, with my mum, Marie [from Quebec]. She was a big help for him because he didn\u2019t feel alone and she knew everything about Canada. For sure it was challenging for him. He left everything behind and was sacrificing a lot. The memory I have of growing up is my dad doing everything he could to make it work for us. We never really felt pressure. Everything he did was for the family and the kids.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sam was also his coach, and led him through the Canadian system from his early teenage years. Shapovalov\u2019s coach was his mother, Tessa \u2013 she still is \u2013 but she took more hands-on control and he learned his tennis almost exclusively from her until he started to rise through the junior ranks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b644a1e10295694767bf6f1c15a0a191258a50f5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b644a1e10295694767bf6f1c15a0a191258a50f5/0_0_5053_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denis Shapovalov\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denis Shapovalov\u2019s mother played for the Soviet Union\u2019s national tennis team.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ella Ling/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe whole story starts with my mum,\u201d Shapovalov says. \u201cShe was playing in the Soviet Union, on the national team. She was pretty good, around 300 to 400 in the world. Then she moved down to Israel with her coach. As soon as I was born, they decided to move to Canada. I was probably about seven months old.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey moved there with nothing. For months we were sleeping just on a mattress in an apartment. My mum started coaching at a tennis club. My dad worked a couple of jobs; he worked in a factory, doing pastries and stuff. They spoke barely any English back then, so it was very difficult. They speak Russian, Ukrainian and Hebrew. My mum\u2019s part-Jewish and my dad\u2019s Greek Russian Orthodox.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"71a04290-c8da-4884-bcd5-899df083e8b9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is the new format? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The All English Lawn Tennis Club announced in October 2018 that it would introduce a final-set tie-break when the score reached 12-12. It means an end to the drama of matches such as the record John Isner v Nicolas Mahut match in 2010, which ended 70-68 as they battled to win by the old rule of two games ahead in the final set.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why did they make the change? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the dramatic 26-24 semi-final final set between Kevin Anderson and Isner last year, with the whole match lasting 6hr 36min, Anderson struggled in the final, losing 6\u20132, 6\u20132, 7\u20136 to Novak Djokovic. After talking to players and reviewing match data Wimbledon decided to make the change. There were also scheduling complexities \u2013 the women\u2019s final between Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber was delayed by more than two hours when the other men\u2019s semi-final was pushed into Saturday as a result of the Anderson\u2011Isner match.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How do the majors compare?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Wimbledon singles matches will still be able to go longer than those at the US and Australian Opens, with the latter this year joining the New York event in going to a tie-break at 6-6, as in any other set. However, Wimbledon will use the standard first-to-seven tie-break, while Melbourne opted for the first-to-10 format, used in doubles in place of a final set (as with Andy Murray\u2019s recent Queen\u2019s semi-final victory alongside Feliciano L\u00f3pez). France are still holding on to the traditional rules, meaning they can, in theory, go on indefinitely in singles matches (doubles matches employ a final-set tie\u2011break).

      "bodyText": "Something is stirring in Canada and it has nothing to do with flying hockey pucks or angry bears. Almost from nowhere tennis is buzzing on the big screens in the sports bars of major cities and in the hundreds of indoor courts across the country. \u201cWhenever anyone would think of Canada,\u201d says Denis Shapovalov, \u201cit was always, like, it\u2019s a hockey country. But now it\u2019s a tennis country. It\u2019s great for every one of us but it\u2019s great for the country.\u201d This, though, is more than a tennis story. The Canadians who have been making global noise in tennis in recent years all owe something to the country\u2019s welcoming embrace of immigrants \u2013 in contrast to what is happening south of their border. They are an asset not a liability because of an enlightened immigration policy. Milos Raonic\u2019s parents came from Serbia as engineers. Vasek Pospisil\u2019s parents are refugees from Czechoslovakia, via Austria. The parents of Bianca Andreescu, the outrageously gifted 19-year-old, were also engineers, arriving in Canada from Romania. Shapovalov\u2019s parents settled in Vaughan, Ontario, after coming from the former Soviet Union via Israel; F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime is the son of a coach who left Togo to settle with relief and optimism in L\u2019Ancienne-Lorette, a suburb of Quebec City. Raonic and Pospisil have already made their mark in the men\u2019s game while Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov are among the leaders of the new wave injecting excitement into a sport that has become mesmerised by the hegemony of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Over the next fortnight at Wimbledon we will see how far their talent takes them. Auger-Aliassime, at 18 years and 10 months, is the youngest player in the men\u2019s draw; he is first to wave the Maple Leaf \u2013 against Pospisil, as it happens \u2013 second up on Court 12 on Monday. They are followed by Raonic against India\u2019s Prajnesh Gunneswaran. The second youngest player in the draw is Shapovalov, at 20 years and two months, and he plays on Tuesday, against the Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis. The internal debate is who will make it first: Auger-Aliassime or Shapovalov? Whoever it is, he will have the support of the other. Shapovalov sounds very much the older brother as he observes, \u201cIt\u2019s always a lot of fun to play with him. There is rivalry, of course, but it\u2019s healthy. The most important thing is we wish the best for each other and we\u2019re really good friends, really close.\u201d During his run to the semi\u2011finals of the Montreal Masters in 2017 Shapovalov slept in Auger\u2011Aliassime\u2019s basement; before he beat Nadal in the third round he ripped the Spaniard\u2019s poster from the wall. There is respect, and there is attitude. These players have both. Auger-Aliassime has earned $1m this year alone, $1.4m since he joined the Tour. Shapovalov is not far behind this season, with $853,277 \u2013 and, longer on the Tour, has career earnings of $3.25m. And consider this: Federer, in his first five matches against top-20 opponents, won only once; in Auger\u2011Aliassime\u2019s first five matches against top-20 players, he did not drop a set, beating Lucas Pouille, 6-4, 6-3, Fabio Fognini 6-2, 6-3, Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2, Nikoloz Basilashvili 7-6 (4), 6-4, and Borna Coric 7-6 (2), 6-2. Only four players have won three titles before they were 17: Richard Gasquet, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, Djokovic \u2013 and Auger-Aliassime. He was the youngest player, at 17, to break into the top 100 since Nadal in 2002. Right now he is not only the youngest player in that group but seeded 21 at Wimbledon and about to scare the living daylights out of some of the seeded stars in his quarter of the draw, including Djokovic, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Daniil Medvedev, Kyle Edmund and Tsitsipas. To listen to him talk about his origins is to hear wisdom beyond his years. \u201cMy father, Sam, came to Canada from Togo when he was 26, with my mum, Marie [from Quebec]. She was a big help for him because he didn\u2019t feel alone and she knew everything about Canada. For sure it was challenging for him. He left everything behind and was sacrificing a lot. The memory I have of growing up is my dad doing everything he could to make it work for us. We never really felt pressure. Everything he did was for the family and the kids.\u201d Sam was also his coach, and led him through the Canadian system from his early teenage years. Shapovalov\u2019s coach was his mother, Tessa \u2013 she still is \u2013 but she took more hands-on control and he learned his tennis almost exclusively from her until he started to rise through the junior ranks. \u201cThe whole story starts with my mum,\u201d Shapovalov says. \u201cShe was playing in the Soviet Union, on the national team. She was pretty good, around 300 to 400 in the world. Then she moved down to Israel with her coach. As soon as I was born, they decided to move to Canada. I was probably about seven months old. \u201cThey moved there with nothing. For months we were sleeping just on a mattress in an apartment. My mum started coaching at a tennis club. My dad worked a couple of jobs; he worked in a factory, doing pastries and stuff. They spoke barely any English back then, so it was very difficult. They speak Russian, Ukrainian and Hebrew. My mum\u2019s part-Jewish and my dad\u2019s Greek Russian Orthodox.\u201d Religion and race count for little in modern Canada. What is resonating there is the chance to forge a new life. For Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov, life could not be much better. As Auger-Aliassime chats to the Guardian about his wonderful life, he has to break off for a scheduled TV interview and is hugely apologetic. But he knows this is the way it is going to be from now on. \u201cBetween matches, practice and rest, you try to fit all these things in. But you get used to it. It\u2019s all about planning. I\u2019m able to be 100% there, for whatever it is I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve got the energy for that.\u201d And he spares a word for his closest tennis friend and rival. \u201cIt has helped both of us having a family structure around. They sacrifice everything for you. They\u2019re not just giving you tennis lessons, they\u2019re giving you life lessons. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for Denis and his mom.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Widespread distrust of the Home Office\u2019s counter-extremism strategy by British Muslims has been cited as one of the obstacles to mosques using a government scheme to protect places of worship from hate crime, after figures showed just 22 received funding last year. The \u00a3375,413 awarded to the mosques under the scheme is a tiny fraction of the \u00a314m provided by a separate government fund for assisting the Jewish community. Applications by 24 mosques failed. While Muslim representatives do not criticise government funding to Jewish counterparts, they are pressing for changes to a wider scheme funding security for mosques, churches and temples at a time when most religious hate crime \u2013 52% of all incidents last year \u2013 is aimed at Muslims. Obstacles to mosques taking advantage of the Home Office\u2019s places of worship protective security scheme \u2013 which was given a boost in funding after the Christchurch attacks and reopens in July \u2013 include bureaucracy surrounding the application process and the inability of mosques in some of the country\u2019s poorest areas to pay costs upfront before being reimbursed. The scheme had been closed at times when mosques needed to access it, including during Ramadan and after Christchurch, according to the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which laid out concerns in a document sent to the Home Office after carrying out consultations in April and May. Without serious changes, the MCB briefing says, the scheme \u201cwill fail to deliver the desired outcomes of good uptake, trust and respect among Muslim and likely other faith communities in Britain today\u201d. Distrust of the government\u2019s Prevent strategy has led some Muslim communities to ignore the fund, and instead fundraise to pay for their own security arrangements and training, according to the MCB. While describing the provision of \u00a35m over three years to support security training as \u201cwell intentioned\u201d, the document contrasted this with the much smaller pot (\u00a31.6m) for available for \u2018physical security\u2019 pointing out that most small to medium sized places of worship lack basic CCTV and alarms \u201cwhich are most urgently needed first before training.\u201d Alarm was also expressed about the omission from the scheme of Northern Ireland and Scotland in light of Islamophobic attacks in both countries. The largest number of applications for funding last year came from mosques in the north-west and West Midlands, with 10 and 8 respectively, figures obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show. Seven came from London, where one successful applicant received \u00a39,283. Churches also continue to access the scheme, with nine receiving a total of \u00a3126,832.32 last year. A member of the inter-faith advisory panel, which overseas applications for funding under the scheme, said the uptake by mosques had been improving but that there was an ongoing debate with other members about how it should be changed. Fiyaz Mughal said: \u201cThere basically needs to be much more money provided to cover the scale of the threat. My own personal opinion is that the government cannot keep pushing the line that all of the communities are in it together. The government are playing politics on this and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s acceptable.

According to Asim Uddin, the chair of the mosque management committee, he and fellow worshipers in Plaistow have become resigned to having to largely fend for themselves when it comes to funding the security of their 18-year-old place of worship against the threats that have accompanied growing intolerance. \u201cWe have learned that it\u2019s better to be self sufficient and use the resources that we have,\u201d said Uddin. He said the mosque had a very good relationship with the police but criticised the Home Office\u2019s places of worship protective security scheme, saying: \u201cWhen we needed to get access it was not open.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve applied in the past but it\u2019s quite complex.

Those concerns were echoed by Mohammed Kozbar, the chairman of Finsbury Park mosque in north London, where one man was killed and nine others were injured when a van was ploughed into them by the terrorist Darren Osborne, who was jailed for life over the attack. A short-term increase in security was also put in place over Ramadan at the mosque, which tends to be on the receiving end of threats that typically multiply after events such as Christchurch. \u201cWe cannot afford to ignore them. You have to take it seriously when someone calls and says \u2018you\u2019re next\u2019,\u201d said Kozbar. Calls are now logged and suspicious mail is opened with gloves, after previous incidents in which white powder was sent in envelopes. Despite this, the mosque remains outward looking, welcoming homeless people for meals on a regular basis, for example. Outside hangs a large banner bearing a line from the Qur\u2019an \u2013 \u201cand made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other\u201d \u2013 with a smaller poster on a wall beneath advertising free self-defence training for women. \u201cAs a small charity we have limited funds.

She was very sweet. She asked me to come up and perform the song with her. She\u2019s so \u201chands off my music\u201d, very fiercely independent and rightfully so, cos her stuff\u2019s great and I don\u2019t want to ruin it. So when she asked I got a little teared up. I came on dressed as her. It was cute.</p> <p><strong>You </strong><strong>make a lot of guest appearances at the festival. Is it just a spur of the moment thing</strong><strong>?</strong></p> <p>There are rehearsals. I flew to Denmark this morning to rehearse with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a> [for a surprise appearance on her Sunday set]. The only way we could rehearse was by me going to a festival she was playing at. Everybody wants their stuff to sound good. Everyone\u2019s a bit of a perfectionist. It\u2019s not just a case of jumping on a pair of decks.</p> <p><strong>Can you remember your first experience at Glastonbury?</strong></p> <p>Because I moved to the States when I was pretty young, I didn\u2019t ever experience Glastonbury until I played it. I heard people talking about the festival as this mythological thing, but you don\u2019t truly understand until you get there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/24/glastonbury2007.glastonbury7\">My first one was 2007</a>. It was really muddy. I remember Wale, the rapper from DC, was touring with us and wouldn\u2019t get off his tour bus. He saw the mud and went \u201cno way.\u201d And then we found out that the night before Dizzee Rascal had worn binbags over his shoes so that he could go on with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/23/glastonbury2007.glastonbury5\">Arctic Monkeys</a>. So we got Wale off the bus [using binbags].</p> <p><strong>Binbags aside, what\u2019s the wildest moment you\u2019ve experienced at Glastonbury?</strong></p> <p>The first year I really had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea of the lay of the land and I was staying at some place off site. I got lost leaving on Saturday because I was staying at some late rave. And our set was on Sunday. So I was kind of freaked out, thinking: \u201cI do need to get some sleep.\u201d It starts raining, and suddenly I see a man coming over the hill. I\u2019m like \u201cThank God, he\u2019s going to tell me where to go\u201d. It turns out he was like a super drunk farmer with 40 sheep behind him. He was cogent enough to direct me, and I went to sleep, but after that I thought, \u2018OK, I\u2019m not risking this luck any more. I\u2019ll stay on site.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had a bad time here. Even just coming here to play a DJ set is interesting. It\u2019s hard to do it wrong unless you have a bad attitude.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c838f54ed40e446e5f7c9b733929709cde1029a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c838f54ed40e446e5f7c9b733929709cde1029a/0_2042_3367_3367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Ronson DJing \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s hard to do it wrong at Glastonbury.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Ronson DJing \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s hard to do it wrong at Glastonbury.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorenzo Garrido</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Speaking of rain, you were here in 2016 for the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/billy-bragg-rallies-glastonbury-aftermath-eu-referendum\">Brexit Glastonbury</a>. What are your memories of that?</strong></p> <p>Brexit happened the day before. It was such a fucking crazy, down vibe. It was really muddy too, and I could tell that I stayed up a little late past my bedtime because all these pictures were of me and Kevin [Parker] wandering through mud and really looking a bit \u201call right mate, go to sleep\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What is the one festival essential you can\u2019t live without?</strong></p> <p>You\u2019ve got to have a toothbrush, and a phone is good. But beyond that I think it\u2019s very much a \u2018go with the flow\u2019 thing.</p> <p><strong>As a </strong><strong>veteran, are there any secret tips you would </strong><strong>give to newcomers?</strong></p> <p>It doesn\u2019t really matter where you go. You plan to see all these things when you get here and you just end up having a drink at some bar and that\u2019s amazing. You\u2019re just hearing the music seep over you from the background. That\u2019s the vibe, not to get too caught up with the schedule and the map. Do that at other festivals. Here\u2019s a bit more in the moment.</p> <p><strong>That must be a little harder when you\u2019re famous. Are you able to visit Glasto incognito?</strong></p> <p>I like going out. This year I\u2019ve got two film cameras and have been going out taking pictures of the crowd and stage. I just wanted to talk to people for fun and do amateur photography. It\u2019s super fun to get into the crowd. If you don\u2019t get into the crowd, you can\u2019t feel the spirit. I understand there\u2019s a certain level of star, like Miley, who can\u2019t go walking around. But this might be the one place where the vibe is chill.</p> <p><strong>Do you think Miley Cyrus will be roaming around </strong><strong>then?</strong></p> <p>She told me she wants to get stuck in on Sunday night. She made me promise I would stay for it. I want to invite her to my club night on Saturday, but I couldn\u2019t in good conscience make her go to a 5am rave the night before her big set. I\u2019ve told her, \u201cIt\u2019s not happening.\u201d The thing is she\u2019s so generous, she\u2019d want to come. And she\u2019d kill it. But you\u2019ve got to save yourself for the big one on Sunday. Get your beauty sleep.<br></p>",

He saw the mud and went \u201cno way.\u201d And then we found out that the night before Dizzee Rascal had worn binbags over his shoes so that he could go on with Arctic Monkeys. So we got Wale off the bus [using binbags]. Binbags aside, what\u2019s the wildest moment you\u2019ve experienced at Glastonbury? The first year I really had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea of the lay of the land and I was staying at some place off site. I got lost leaving on Saturday because I was staying at some late rave. And our set was on Sunday. So I was kind of freaked out, thinking: \u201cI do need to get some sleep.\u201d It starts raining, and suddenly I see a man coming over the hill. I\u2019m like \u201cThank God, he\u2019s going to tell me where to go\u201d. It turns out he was like a super drunk farmer with 40 sheep behind him. He was cogent enough to direct me, and I went to sleep, but after that I thought, \u2018OK, I\u2019m not risking this luck any more. I\u2019ll stay on site.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had a bad time here. Even just coming here to play a DJ set is interesting. It\u2019s hard to do it wrong unless you have a bad attitude. Speaking of rain, you were here in 2016 for the notorious Brexit Glastonbury. What are your memories of that? Brexit happened the day before. It was such a fucking crazy, down vibe. It was really muddy too, and I could tell that I stayed up a little late past my bedtime because all these pictures were of me and Kevin [Parker] wandering through mud and really looking a bit \u201call right mate, go to sleep\u201d. What is the one festival essential you can\u2019t live without? You\u2019ve got to have a toothbrush, and a phone is good. But beyond that I think it\u2019s very much a \u2018go with the flow\u2019 thing. As a veteran, are there any secret tips you would give to newcomers? It doesn\u2019t really matter where you go. You plan to see all these things when you get here and you just end up having a drink at some bar and that\u2019s amazing. You\u2019re just hearing the music seep over you from the background. That\u2019s the vibe, not to get too caught up with the schedule and the map. Do that at other festivals. Here\u2019s a bit more in the moment. That must be a little harder when you\u2019re famous. Are you able to visit Glasto incognito? I like going out. This year I\u2019ve got two film cameras and have been going out taking pictures of the crowd and stage. I just wanted to talk to people for fun and do amateur photography. It\u2019s super fun to get into the crowd. If you don\u2019t get into the crowd, you can\u2019t feel the spirit. I understand there\u2019s a certain level of star, like Miley, who can\u2019t go walking around. But this might be the one place where the vibe is chill. Do you think Miley Cyrus will be roaming around then? She told me she wants to get stuck in on Sunday night. She made me promise I would stay for it. I want to invite her to my club night on Saturday, but I couldn\u2019t in good conscience make her go to a 5am rave the night before her big set. I\u2019ve told her, \u201cIt\u2019s not happening.\u201d The thing is she\u2019s so generous, she\u2019d want to come. And she\u2019d kill it. But you\u2019ve got to save yourself for the big one on Sunday. Get your beauty sleep.",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/20/donald-tusk-demands-answer-to-irish-border-question-next-month\">French president, Emmanuel Macron, ripped up Chequers</a>. \u201cThose who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it\u2019s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,\u201d said Macron.</p> \n<p>Later an image circulated via Instagram.

Sorry, no cherries,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn8Luwbjzf9/?hl=hi\">read the caption</a> alongside the picture of May and the European council president, Donald Tusk.

      "bodyText": "After three years of turning up in Brussels only to be exiled to another room while the other 27 EU leaders ate a three-course meal and dissected Britain\u2019s post-Brexit plans, Theresa May finally said her not-so-fond au revoir to the European stage on Sunday evening at what she said would likely be her last summit, admitting in her typically low-key way that there had been some \u201ctough and long discussions about Brexit\u201d along the way. Here is a rundown of her visits in Brussels\u2019 version of the Big Brother house. Start as you mean to go on It started with a \u201cpfff\u201d. Asked about May\u2019s Brexit comments at her first EU summit, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, gave a gallic shrug and did his impression of a tyre with a slow puncture. In October 2016, three months after becoming leader of the Conservative party and taking the keys to Downing Street, the then unknown quantity that was the second female UK prime minister had arrived in Brussels \u2013 and treated the 27 other heads of state and government to their first blast of Maybot. In a five-minute slot at 1am, after a six-hour session on the migration crisis and Russian aggression in Syria, May delivered her \u201cclear message\u201d that the UK was leaving the EU but would play a full role until that point. \u201cWe had no special event with Theresa May,\u201d said Junker. Alone with the plant pots Staring at an empty table with only a row of plant pots for company, the image of a dejected-looking May at the October 2017 European council offered a neat pictorial summary of the state of the Brexit negotiations that autumn. Britain was desperate to move on from talking about the withdrawal agreement \u2013 citizens\u2019 rights, the divorce bill and the Irish border \u2013 and on to talks about the future trade relationship. The EU felt that \u201cinsufficient progress\u201d had been made. Juncker used a summit press conference to deny reports that May had pleaded for her political life at a recent dinner and was \u201canxious\u201d, \u201ctormented\u201d, \u201cdespondent and discouraged\u201d. She had been in \u201cgood shape\u201d and \u201cfighting\u201d, Juncker insisted. Humiliated The prime minister had weathered the resignations of her Brexit secretary, David Davis, and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, after unveiling her Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU that summer. The EU27 joining her in September 2018 at a meeting in Salzburg in the Austrian alps had intended to offer warm words as the British prime minister sought to finalise the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, and then try to sell it at home. Instead, provoked by an ill-thought-out editorial from the prime minister published in a German newspaper accusing the EU of demanding the unacceptable over Northern Ireland, the leaders went on the attack. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, ripped up Chequers. \u201cThose who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it\u2019s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,\u201d said Macron. Later an image circulated via Instagram. A cake had been offered to a few leaders and their aides, including May. \u201cA piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries,\u201d read the caption alongside the picture of May and the European council president, Donald Tusk. With relations soured, Tusk was accused in the media, to his horror, of mocking the diabetic British prime minister. The next day, back in Downing Street, May made a statement asking for mutual respect. Nebulous, moi? \u201cYou called me nebulous?\u201d It was 14 December 2018, and a few moments before the European council \u2013 the EU\u2019s 28 leaders \u2013 were to sit down to discuss the issues of the day. It was unclear whether the prime minister was aware but the TV cameras had yet to be turned out of the summit room. May made a beeline for Juncker. \u201cWhat did you call me? You called me nebulous.\u201d \u201cNo I didn\u2019t, no I didn\u2019t\u201d, responded a startled European commission president. Juncker had hours earlier used exactly that word to describe the negotiating positions emerging from Britain. \u201cWe were not dancing \u2026 she thought that I did criticise her,\u201d Juncker later admitted of their \u201crobust discussion\u201d. \u201cAnd in the course of the morning after having checked what I said yesterday night, she was kissing me,\u201d he added with a smile. Awkward The emergence of the former Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans as front runner to replace Juncker as the next European commission president leaves May in a tricky spot. Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia looked likely to try to block Timmermans as he has been a strident advocate for the rule of law in countries where it has been threatened in his role as vice president of the commission. Italy\u2019s populist government could go the same way, leaving May with a casting vote. She arrived at the summit and lived up to the dramatic moment by promising to be \u201cconstructive\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham are poised to make their first senior signing in more than a year after agreeing to buy the teenage winger Jack Clarke from Leeds. The clubs are putting the finishing touches to a transfer for which Spurs will pay an initial fee of \u00a310m, rising to \u00a311.5m depending on achievements. As they completed the construction of their new stadium Spurs let the last two transfer windows pass without any major recruitment, so the purchase of Clarke is evidence of loosening purse strings at the north London club. However, Clarke will not strengthen Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s squad immediately, as he will be loaned straight back to Leeds to continue his development there next season. The player enjoyed a breakthrough campaign with Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side last season, showing himself to be a bold and skilful dribbler with useful end-product. Most of his contributions came off the bench, as he only made four starts all season. His progress was inhibited partly by illness, as he was out of first-team action for a month after collapsing on the pitch during the 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough in February. Leeds expect him to play a bigger role next season and help the club to reach the Premier League automatically after they lost to Derby in the play-off semi-finals in May. Spurs trust the player will gain from another campaign in the Championship under the guidance of Pochettino\u2019s former mentor, Bielsa. Spurs are still pursuing players they expect to make a more instant impact as Pochettino aims to bolster a squad that reached last season\u2019s Champions League final. Fulham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon is a target and talks continue with Lyon for the midfielder Tanguy Ndombele, with Spurs confident despite reports of Juventus trying to muscle in on a deal. Ndombele is understood to have indicated that Spurs are his preferred choice.",

Friends Harry Hayward and Minnie Bartley (both 22) and Joe Holley (23) are sitting in the park eating pizza, Harry in a multi-coloured umbrella hat (\u201cIt\u2019s quite sweaty\u201d). It\u2019s their first time at Glastonbury. They want to talk about environmentalism and politics (it has been noted that more people yelled: \u201cfuck the government and fuck Boris\u201d at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage\" title=\"\">Stormzy\u2019s Saturday headline set</a> than will actually be able to vote for Johnson to be prime minister, while Zac Goldsmith was booed at his own event).</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely good that Glastonbury is pushing the green agenda.

But is it enough, I ask. And doesn\u2019t she think other festivals have been way ahead of the curve? Mandala festival in the Netherlands, or <a href=\"https://www.shambalafestival.org/essential-info/sustainability/\" title=\"\">Shambala</a> in Northamptonshire, for instance, which is powered by 100% renewable energy and doesn\u2019t allow Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 products to be sold on site. </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really tough when you have something the size and scale of Glastonbury,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they have given us this space, and other spaces, and we\u2019ve got videos playing around. It is great that the festival is embracing what we\u2019re talking about. I do feel it is seeping into the DNA of the place.\u201d </p> <p>Glastonbury has long been conscious of its footprint. The reusable 80% recycled <a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/green-glastonbury/stainless-steel-cups/\" title=\"\">stainless steel cups</a> sold on site for a fiver were originally produced in 2016 as a way to help support <a href=\"https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/glastonbury-launches-reusable-british-steel-pint-cups/\" title=\"\">the besieged British steel industry</a>. (Although I watch loads of people being served their drinks in cardboard cups even when they proffer their steel cup, and the cardboard cups do not always end up in the correct bins.)</p> <p>It is also customary that any tents left behind are repurposed. In 2016, a charity called Aid Box Convoy collected abandoned tents and sent them to refugee camps in Europe. (But it is estimated that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/festival-tents-charity-donation-environment-damage-music-a8513401.html\" title=\"\">90% of </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/festival-tents-charity-donation-environment-damage-music-a8513401.html\" title=\"\">tents left at festivals end up as landfill</a>.)</p> <p>At a Leftfield event called How to Save Our Planet, the Labour MP Clive Lewis and Minnie Rahman, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, point out that climate justice intersects with social, racial and class justice. Rahman says: \u201cWhite people are overwhelmingly represented in the climate movement. I\u2019d really like to see the movement taking forward the connection that climate change doesn\u2019t affect us all equally. We see people in the global south, for instance, dying to protect their land, or the health impacts in parts of Britain because of air pollution.\u201d A panel by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/guardian-weekend-gal-dem-takeover\" title=\"\">gal-dem</a> makes similar points in their own discussions.</p> <p>The Leftfield tent is rammed. Although a few brims of straw hats are sliding down noses in the midday heat, the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas is afforded a rock-star welcome and a huge cheer goes up when she mentions Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Lucas\u2019s reference to the Green New Deal, a private member\u2019s bill she has tabled with Lewis that is inspired by Ocasio-Cortez, is met with a cacophony of applause. An audience member mooting the role nuclear power might have in addition to renewables is quickly talked down.</p> <p>The Norwegian singer Aurora released <a href=\"https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/a-different-kind-of-human-aurora-album-review\" title=\"\">A Different Kind of Human (Step II)</a>, an album themed around ecological disaster, earlier this month. Before performing on the John Peel stage, she tells me that she always knew the album was going to be about the climate crisis. When I ask if she will be sticking around after her set, the answer is no, because she is flying to Belgium. What does she do to lessen her own environmental impact, especially when touring? She mentions wooden toothbrushes and being vegetarian.</p> <p>Johannes Hogebrink, an artist from Amsterdam, has also flown to the UK for Glastonbury and is busy crafting a sand sculpture for Extinction Rebellion. The sculpture is a huge skull with a beetle crawling out of one eye and money coming out of the mouth. \u201cYou cannot eat money, oh no!\u201d as Aurora\u2019s song The Seed has it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90cfeea39ca0537b497bdcaf530ace36fb025721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90cfeea39ca0537b497bdcaf530ace36fb025721/0_0_5668_3401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Climate crisis protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Climate crisis protesters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over at the Shangri-La, this year\u2019s theme is \u201cJunkstaposition\u201d and it is home to the Disruption Bureau, a training centre for activists. Organisations including Amnesty International and Extinction Rebellion offer activities such as placard-making and flag-printing, but the most common interactions I observe are the handing out of leaflets and the signing of petitions.</p> <p>However, there is a great audio installation by Echoic Audio called Memory Tree, and the open-air art pieces are impressive, if not beautiful (that\u2019s kind of the point), including trees that are made from assorted waste. The Gas Tower is made entirely from recovered ocean plastic.</p> <p>Before her panel, I ask Lucas about Glastonbury 2011, when she appeared on the Pyramid stage before Wu-Tang Clan. \u201cIt was great,\u201d she says, \u201cinspiring and exciting. But terrifying.\u201d She is thrilled that young ipeople are taking up the climate cause, such as George Bond, a 16-year-old activist, also on the panel. Equally inspiring at the other end of the age spectrum is Barbara Richardson, here on behalf of the <a href=\"http://www.talkfracking.org/fracking-news/who-are-the-nanas/\" title=\"\">Fracking Na</a><a href=\"http://www.talkfracking.org/fracking-news/who-are-the-nanas/\" title=\"\">nas</a>.</p> <p>Bond throws an important date out, 20 September, which he says will be \u201cthe largest climate demonstration this country ever has seen. It\u2019s gonna be huge, it\u2019s gonna be beautiful, but it\u2019s also gonna be filled with anger and rage that nothing has been done.\u201d </p> <p>Last week, the government pledged to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\">net</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\" title=\"\"> emissions down to zero by 2050</a>. But it is simply not good enough. As Lucas puts it, it\u2019s a bit like calling the fire brigade in an emergency and asking them to turn up in 30 years\u2019 time.</p> <p>As the burning sun goes down and jumpers are pulled out from backpacks, a man tosses his chip wrapper on the ground, his mate crushing a can before hurling it into the grass. A bunch of people take cocaine in the gloaming, which in its own way is ravaging the parts of the world Kurikunda talked about protecting.</p> <p>Glastonbury is making a massive effort, albeit with room for improvement. And the ecstatic response to Attenborough is an indication that environmentalism is much cooler than it ever was \u2013 people genuinely care now. But we\u2019ll know soon enough whether the festivalgoers matched the organisers\u2019 green aspirations and took away with them not just brilliant memories, possible sunburn and multiple blisters, but all the other rubbish they were asked politely to do so.</p>",

Over at the Shangri-La, this year\u2019s theme is \u201cJunkstaposition\u201d and it is home to the Disruption Bureau, a training centre for activists. Organisations including Amnesty International and Extinction Rebellion offer activities such as placard-making and flag-printing, but the most common interactions I observe are the handing out of leaflets and the signing of petitions. However, there is a great audio installation by Echoic Audio called Memory Tree, and the open-air art pieces are impressive, if not beautiful (that\u2019s kind of the point), including trees that are made from assorted waste. The Gas Tower is made entirely from recovered ocean plastic. Before her panel, I ask Lucas about Glastonbury 2011, when she appeared on the Pyramid stage before Wu-Tang Clan. \u201cIt was great,\u201d she says, \u201cinspiring and exciting. But terrifying.\u201d She is thrilled that young ipeople are taking up the climate cause, such as George Bond, a 16-year-old activist, also on the panel. Equally inspiring at the other end of the age spectrum is Barbara Richardson, here on behalf of the Fracking Nanas. Bond throws an important date out, 20 September, which he says will be \u201cthe largest climate demonstration this country ever has seen. It\u2019s gonna be huge, it\u2019s gonna be beautiful, but it\u2019s also gonna be filled with anger and rage that nothing has been done.\u201d Last week, the government pledged to get net emissions down to zero by 2050. But it is simply not good enough. As Lucas puts it, it\u2019s a bit like calling the fire brigade in an emergency and asking them to turn up in 30 years\u2019 time. As the burning sun goes down and jumpers are pulled out from backpacks, a man tosses his chip wrapper on the ground, his mate crushing a can before hurling it into the grass. A bunch of people take cocaine in the gloaming, which in its own way is ravaging the parts of the world Kurikunda talked about protecting. Glastonbury is making a massive effort, albeit with room for improvement. And the ecstatic response to Attenborough is an indication that environmentalism is much cooler than it ever was \u2013 people genuinely care now. But we\u2019ll know soon enough whether the festivalgoers matched the organisers\u2019 green aspirations and took away with them not just brilliant memories, possible sunburn and multiple blisters, but all the other rubbish they were asked politely to do so.",

      "body": "<p>On Monday at Wimbledon, a teenage hopeful will take centre stage against one of the greats of the game, dreaming of one day emulating their achievements. It is something that countless players have done in the past, only for most of them to fall by the wayside. But American Cori Gauff is no ordinary 15-year-old.</p> <p>Nicknamed \u201cCoco\u201d, Gauff is the youngest player ever to qualify for the main draw at Wimbledon, having come through three matches in qualifying without losing a set. She won the junior French Open title in 2018 at the age of 14, her agent is part of Roger Federer\u2019s management group and, according to Forbes, she is predicted to earn more than $1m (\u00a3790,000) off the court in 2019 thanks to a burgeoning group of sponsors.</p> <p>As Gauff is a young, tall, black American, with a huge serve, strong all-court game and athletic physique, there have been inevitable comparisons with Serena Williams, the 23-time grand slam champion, a woman Gauff describes as her hero. On Monday, though, she will take on Venus Williams, the five-times champion, in the first round. Gauff told the BBC that playing against Venus was a \u201cdream\u201d for her. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see how I do.\u201d</p> <p>The match is garnering huge attention, with everyone from Serena and Federer also keen to see how she gets on. \u201cI\u2019m super happy for her,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great storyline. I hope they put them on a big court. I think that would be a great, wonderful experience for Coco and Venus anyway. It\u2019s a great story. Coco is a nice girl, works really hard. I think she\u2019s obviously got a wonderful future ahead of herself.\u201d</p> <p>Serena Williams, who is chasing history herself as she tries to equal the all-time grand slam record of 24 titles, held by Margaret Court, rarely watches Venus play but said she might make an exception this time. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, because Cori is such an exciting young player,\u201d Williams said \u201cShe\u2019s so cool. She\u2019s a great girl. I love her dad. They\u2019re just really cool people.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great moment for her and for Venus. It\u2019s going to be a big moment for Venus, as well. She actually reminds me of Venus, kind of, her body and everything. She\u2019s such a fantastic young lady. She works very hard. Every time I see her out there working, training, her and her dad. It reminds me of the time where I was out there with my dad. I can\u2019t help but look inside of myself and be proud and be happy for her. It\u2019s really nice to see.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Gauff now lives in Delray Beach, Florida. Her father, Corey, played basketball at Georgia State University and her mother, Candi, ran track at Florida State University. Her natural athleticism is obvious but her mental strength and her character are equally impressive, helping her to handle the pressure of being considered \u201cthe next big thing\u201d.</p> <p>Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams\u2019s coach, has worked with Gauff for the past few years and believes she is well-equipped to cope with whatever expectations are placed on her shoulders. \u201cShe is one of the players that experienced incredible pressure at an early age,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that often, because it\u2019s very rare to see someone under the spotlight that early, and usually even players who are 15, 16, 17 when they start to have that pressure, most of them don\u2019t do well with that.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons she\u2019s so amazing, because since she\u2019s 12 she\u2019s made history. She was the youngest at 12 to win an under-18 event in the US, the youngest to play the final of the US Open in juniors [she was 13 when she lost in the 2017 final] in the Open era and again now. I can feel the pressure that she has. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t care about it, she feels it but you can see that she finds a way to deal with it. The top players, the top, top ones, they\u2019re in exactly the same situation, they feel it but they deal with it. It\u2019s heavy but most of the time it\u2019s not too heavy for them and she finds a way, which is really amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Home-schooled by her mother, Gauff seems remarkably grounded, despite the predictions of stardom and the lucrative sponsorship contracts, including New Balance, Head and the Italian pasta group Barilla, which also just happens to sponsor Federer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bd9696664c57135d9c51204ca5a7ed8bf32af1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bd9696664c57135d9c51204ca5a7ed8bf32af1/0_108_3225_1935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cori Gauff during a preview day at Wimbledon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cori Gauff during a preview day at Wimbledon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gauff has the world at her feet but the big danger is that the expectations will be too great, too soon. \u201cYou know that if she plays a good match, everybody\u2019s going to tweet she\u2019s the next No 1, she\u2019s going to win several grand slams,\u201d Mouratoglou said, citing the French player Caroline Garcia, who was tipped at 16, by, among others, Andy Murray, as a future world No 1. \u201cShe\u2019s so far from there,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cOf course she has the potential but we should let her make her way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/living-on-a-shoestring-the-reality-of-tennis-below-the-world-of-wimbledon\">Living on a shoestring: the reality of tennis below the world of Wimbledon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How she handles the occasion against Venus Williams will be a good indication of her future progress.

It means an end to the drama of matches such as the record John Isner v Nicolas Mahut match in 2010, which ended 70-68 as they battled to win by the old rule of two games ahead in the final set.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why did they make the change? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the dramatic 26-24 semi-final final set between Kevin Anderson and Isner last year, with the whole match lasting 6hr 36min, Anderson struggled in the final, losing 6\u20132, 6\u20132, 7\u20136 to Novak Djokovic. After talking to players and reviewing match data Wimbledon decided to make the change. There were also scheduling complexities \u2013 the women\u2019s final between Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber was delayed by more than two hours when the other men\u2019s semi-final was pushed into Saturday as a result of the Anderson\u2011Isner match.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How do the majors compare?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Wimbledon singles matches will still be able to go longer than those at the US and Australian Opens, with the latter this year joining the New York event in going to a tie-break at 6-6, as in any other set. However, Wimbledon will use the standard first-to-seven tie-break, while Melbourne opted for the first-to-10 format, used in doubles in place of a final set (as with Andy Murray\u2019s recent Queen\u2019s semi-final victory alongside Feliciano L\u00f3pez). France are still holding on to the traditional rules, meaning they can, in theory, go on indefinitely in singles matches (doubles matches employ a final-set tie\u2011break). Beno\u00eet Paire and Pierre-Hughes Herbert won 11-9 in the fifth at Roland Garros last month, playing 4 hours 33 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Has the decision been received well?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Anderson, who suggested changes in his post-match interview, has welcomed it as \u201ca good compromise\u201d. Greg Rusedski, though, believes all tie-breaks should be triggered at 6-6. He said: \u201cIt creates more drama and players will be less tired for the next round.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>But weren\u2019t the epic matches part of the Wimbledon fairytale? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Even Andy Murray admitted it was a struggle to sit through Isner\u2011Anderson. In fact, only 15 singles matches have gone past 12-12 in the final set at Wimbledon in the past two decades. But under the new rule we would have been denied such classics as Roger Federer v Andy Roddick in the 2009 final, when Federer won the final set 16-14.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>An outstanding athlete and renowned counterpuncher, Kerber can be vulnerable against the harder hitters.

Corbyn and his party have rejected the claims made in the Times on Saturday, which said that, at a recent event, senior civil servants had discussed their worries about what might happen if the Labour leader became prime minister. The report cited anonymous senior civil servants who warned that they were concerned about Corbyn being put into Downing Street after an election as he seemed to lack a firm grasp of issues and was being \u201cpropped up\u201d by his advisers.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump Jr is \u201clike a coward\u201d for tweeting and deleting a racist attack on Kamala Harris, Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro said on Sunday. Racist criticism of Harris proliferated online after Thursday\u2019s second debate, in which she shone in opposition to former vice-president Joe Biden, particularly when she grilled him over his past opposition to bussing as a way to racially integrate schools. Harris announced a fundraising surge after the debate, with $2m coming in over 24 hours. The RealClearPolitics.com national polling average puts her fourth in the Democratic field, behind Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. During the debate on Thursday, Donald Trump\u2019s oldest son reposted a message from Ali Alexander, a far-right personality, which said: \u201cKamala Harris is implying she is descended from American Black Slaves. She\u2019s not. She comes from Jamaican Slave Owners. That\u2019s fine. She\u2019s not an American Black. Period.\u201d \u201cIs this true?\u201d Trump Jr asked. \u201cWow.\u201d Harris\u2019s father is Jamaican and her mother was from India. Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and US housing secretary, who would be the first Hispanic president, performed strongly in the first debate on Wednesday. On Sunday he appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said of Trump Jr\u2019s tweet. \u201cIt has no place in our politics. This is the game that these folks play. They put something out there. You notice what he did. He tweeted it out and then he deleted it like a coward, so he can say, \u2018Oh, that was a mistake.\u2019 \u201cBut he knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s giving voice to these racist utterances about Senator Harris. We need to dispel them immediately and condemn them and then not give them any more life, because they\u2019re disgusting.\u201d Castro was not alone in defending the senator and criticising Trump Jr. Most of the Democratic candidates did so. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, for example, tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump Jr is a racist too. Shocker.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, wrote: \u201cKamala Harris has been powerfully voicing her Black American experience. Her first-generation story embodies the American dream. It\u2019s long past time to end these racist, birther-style attacks.\u201d That was a reference to \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theorists who claim Barack Obama, born to an American mother and a Kenyan father, was not born in the US and was thus not qualified to be president. Donald Trump rose to political prominence by championing such attacks, before admitting Obama was born in the US. Some rightwing social media accounts have accused Harris of being an \u201canchor baby\u201d \u2013 a derogatory term used to describe children born in the US to immigrant parents. Also on CNN on Sunday, Amy Klobuchar was asked if she believed attacks on Harris were being generated by Russians, as she seemed to imply in her first response to Trump Jr\u2019s tweet. \u201cI have no idea who\u2019s responsible for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI just know that [Russia has] messed around on the internet many times with bots and other things and there has been some connection to them way past the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI think the bigger point I was making in light of President Trump hanging out with Vladimir Putin again is that we as a country are supposed to be about the truth.\u201d",

I\u2019ve always wanted to play a solo show on a big stage at Glastonbury and I didn\u2019t think it would be like that. I wasn\u2019t expecting as many people to be there dancing. I was shocked. You never know how many people are going to listen to your music but I really wanted these new songs to connect more and be accessible in a way that my first record wasn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "Surrounded by a brutalist modern-day industrial estate, an extraordinary piece of 19th-century architecture peeps out from behind an overgrown hedge. The Grade II*-listed building described by English Heritage as \u201cone of the highlights of Victorian Gothic architecture in the country\u201d is the oldest surviving synagogue in Manchester. However, this red-brick mismatch with its surroundings is somewhat unloved, after being deserted by its congregation in the 1980s. The Victorian building, Moorish in style and built by Jewish cotton traders from Spain and Portugal, sits in what was once a thriving Jewish quarter. Its congregation were Sephardi Jews, originally from the Iberian peninsula. In 1911 more than 30,000 Jewish people lived and worked in Cheetham Hill, one of Manchester\u2019s most culturally diverse suburbs, which has also been home to Irish, Caribbean and Asian immigrants. But the community left for the leafier suburbs to the north and south of the city and the area\u2019s synagogues were abandoned, demolished or converted. Now sitting among takeaways and textile warehouses, and just a few streets away from Strangeways prison, this synagogue\u2019s survival is exceptional. Given a new lease of life as the Manchester Jewish Museum in 1984 \u2013 Britain\u2019s only Jewish museum outside London \u2013 it became home to more than 30,000 objects, from personal letters and photographs to Torah scrolls hidden from the Nazis during WWII. These objects tell the story of Jewish Manchester as well as broader stories of migration, identity and the Holocaust. But all agree that it is due a facelift. It was last refurbished more than three decades ago and its size means curators have only ever been able to showcase about 1% of the collection. In just a few days the museum will close its doors for almost two years for an ambitious \u00a35m development project, partly funded by a National Lottery grant of \u00a32.89m in 2017. There will be a new cafe serving hot salt beef bagels, chicken soup with matzo balls and potato latkes. The museum itself will double in size, with new galleries, learning spaces and a shop built in an extension connected to the existing building by a glass bridge. But for its chief executive, Max Dunbar, who has worked at the National Portrait Gallery, Christie\u2019s auctioneers and the World Rugby Museum, the most exciting part of the project is the new \u201clearning kitchen\u201d. In recent years the former synagogue has become an event space for the local community, hosting everything from Bollywood concerts to hip-hop nights and Polish dumpling tastings. Dunbar said: \u201cWe have always found that food brings people together, so the learning kitchen will be a community space where we will break bread together, have curry nights and allow people to interact in a way that they wouldn\u2019t normally. \u201cWe are very conscious that we need to support this community and reach out to them. This will not just be a space for the Jewish people here, it will be for everyone. We are planning to challenge the perception of what a Jewish museum is.\u201d The redeveloped museum is hoping annual visitor numbers will rise from 10,000 to 40,000 when it opens in 2021. As the museum packs up to move to its temporary home in Manchester Central Library, its creative producer, Laura Seddon, says she has made some \u201cexciting discoveries\u201d \u2013 this being the first time in years all of the museum\u2019s collections have been opened and catalogued. Seddon discovers a second world war letter from a Jewish family, the Leisers, thanking the Singleton family in Moss Side for the care of the Leisers\u2019 children Fanny and Manfred, who had come from Germany on the kindertransport. Fanny and Manfred travelled to the US in 1947 aged 16 and 13 and were reunited with their mother. The letter ends: \u201cI thank you a thousand times for what you have done for my children and me.\u201d Dunbar hopes that stories such as this will help bring communities together in what he described as \u201ctroubled times\u201d. \u201cThe stories we are uncovering of Manchester\u2019s Jewish community are also the stories of today. We learn about Jewish people who were forced to flee their homes and settled in alien environments trying somehow to rebuild their shattered lives. \u201cThese stories remind us what happens when politics and religion seek to drive us apart and how a wonderful, diverse city like Manchester can bring people together.\u201d",

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has opposed Weber\u2019s claim to the role as group leader of the European People\u2019s party (EPP), the largest group in the European parliament. Merkel agreed at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, that despite her support for Weber, he would not get the top job but would be given a senior role elsewhere, potentially as president of the European parliament.

But other leaders from Weber\u2019s centre-right EPP group, including the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also spoke of their concerns about the centre-left candidate taking control, as Merkel\u2019s solution appeared to unravel. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s a lot opposition to the proposal that was made in Osaka from the EPP\u2019s point of view,\u201d Varadkar said. \u201cThe vast majority of the EPP prime ministers don\u2019t believe that we should give up the presidency of the commission quite so easily, without a fight.\u201d Plans for the 28 EU heads of state and government to make a decision on their preferred candidate as commission president, and for other roles including the presidencies of the European council and European Central Bank, by breakfast on Monday morning appeared doomed to fail with another summit on the issue in mid-July looking increasingly likely. A working dinner on Sunday of pea soup, fillets of sole and a dark chocolate dessert was hours late in starting and had to be suspended midway to allow further bilateral talks to take place in a clear sign of the difficulties. It had been hoped that the leaders\u2019 nomination for commission president would be voted on by the European parliament in the coming days. Whoever replaces Juncker will be in post after 31 October by which time Johnson, the frontrunner for the Tory leadership, has said the UK will leave with or without a deal. A former Dutch foreign minister who is currently one of Juncker\u2019s deputies with responsibility for rule of law issues, Timmermans, 58, is a longstanding critic of Johnson. He criticised him after the EU referendum for equating the actions of the EU to Adolf Hitler\u2019s attempts to unify Europe, and describing Barack Obama as \u201cthe part-Kenyan president\u201d who harboured an \u201cancestral dislike of the British empire\u201d. \u201cWould it not have been enough to say that you disagree with the American president\u2019s point of view?\u201d Timmermans wrote in a blog the day after the referendum. \u201cWhy discredit not just his motives, but even his persona, with borderline racist remarks?\u201d He went on: \u201cTo accuse people who believe in [the EU] of trying to finish where Hitler left off is, to say the least, a bit rich. How did hatred become an integral part of all this? Why is it necessary?\u201d Since the referendum, Timmermans has repeatedly suggested the British public might wish to \u201crethink\u201d the decision to leave the EU while accepting the legitimacy of the 2016 vote, targeting Johnson for criticism. \u201cHas Boris Johnson gone to the doctors and nurses of the NHS and said: \u2018I did promise you \u00a3350m extra a week; sorry, I can\u2019t deliver on that promise\u2019?\u201d Timmermans said in a speech to the European parliament in March. Timmermans\u2019s energetic campaigning as the lead candidate, or Spitzenkandidat, of the Socialists and Democrats during the European elections was seen as having played a key role in the resurgence of the Dutch Labour party, of which he is a member. Under the Spitzenkandidaten system, first used in 2014 for Juncker\u2019s appointment, the election results are expected to be decisive in terms of the political orientation of the president of the commission. While the EPP remained as the biggest group after the elections, it had emerged weaker than before and the Socialists and Democrats came in a relatively close second ahead of the strengthened liberal and green political groups. Timmermans, the son of a diplomat, has in recent years championed green causes including a \u201cwar on plastic\u201d, sparring with the British environment secretary, Michael Gove, on the issue on social media. He has also been mentioned recently by Macron, whose La R\u00e9publique En Marche party is part of the liberal Renew Europe group in the parliament, as a strong and acceptable candidate for commission president.",

Kensington and Chelsea council, which announced its veto of the plan before a formal consultation had ended, was also unable to say how it knew the people who contacted them about the scheme actually lived in the borough. The authority had said it was blocking the scheme because an overwhelming majority of residents opposed the idea. But the London Cycling Campaign (LCC) said the lack of basic information about what people actually said made this argument \u201cbeyond flimsy\u201d. The council has faced vehement criticism for its decision to pull out of the process, with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, saying it had \u201cmade a total mockery of the consultation\u201d. In a letter to the council\u2019s leader, Khan wrote: \u201cI would like to know how many more of your residents need to be maimed or killed by motor vehicles before you accept that this is a serious problem that needs solving.\u201d The leader, Elizabeth Campbell, replied to Khan saying she was confident residents had opposed the proposed bike route. She said about 1,000 emails and letters had been sent to the council, and 6,500 people signed a petition opposing the removal of trees as part of the scheme. But when asked, the council was unable to tell the Guardian how many of the 1,000 people in fact supported the scheme, or whether all those who wrote in were automatically counted as opponents without checking. A spokesman was also unable to say what proportion of those who wrote in or signed the petition lived in the area, and what, if any, efforts had been made to ensure the correspondence received was representative of wider feeling in the borough. Transport for London (TfL), which wants to build the route, will publish the results of a formal consultation in the coming weeks that has received more than 5,000 responses. Simon Munk, an infrastructure campaigner with the LCC, said the council\u2019s steadfast view on supposed opinion in the borough was \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said: \u201cThe idea \u2018the vast majority\u2019 of residents oppose this scheme is beyond flimsy.\u201d It appeared, he said, that a \u201cnoisy, but relatively small minority have been allowed to derail a vital and valuable scheme and encouraged the borough to undermine a formal consultation process\u201d. The was further controversy around the objections process after one person who attended a public meeting claiming to oppose the cycling plan on behalf of the family of a young woman killed on her bike in the borough was actually a distant non-blood relative and did not have any contact with, or support from, the family. A spokesman for the council said: \u201cWe are 100% certain that our position reflects the views of local residents. We will, of course, consider the wider picture when TfL present the results later in the year.\u201d",

Real negotiations are back on. The question, as ever, is whether they will lead anywhere.</p> \n<p>There is no question that Trump\u2019s motives for calling the meeting, at a day\u2019s notice, were primarily electoral. Throughout the day, Trump grumbled repeatedly about how he had not been given enough credit from the press for defusing tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/30/trump-to-travel-to-demilitarised-zone-for-possible-meeting-with-kim-jong-un\">Donald Trump invites Kim Jong-un to US after entering North Korea</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His own narrative cut a few corners to say the least, omitting to mention that the most dangerous moments \u2013 North Korea\u2019s test of a hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and his own threats of \u201cfire and fury\u201d \u2013 all happened in his first year in office. He insisted that all North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile tests had ceased, by declaring that the short-range solid-fuel missile tests in May were not actually tests. He did not explain.</p> \n<p>The DMZ meeting was all about shaping a narrative. That is why John Bolton, the ultra-hawkish national security adviser, was nowhere to be seen; he had been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbJohnBolton/status/1145288948291440642\">sent, or sent himself</a>, to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. But the official US party included Tucker Carlson, a Fox News talkshow host, who is Trump\u2019s principal channel to the non-interventionist section of his far-right base. Eleventh-hour conversations with Carlson reportedly persuaded Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/donald-trump-retaliatory-iran-airstrike-cancelled-10-minutes-before\">not to launch missiles</a> against Iran this month, after the downing of a US drone.</p> \n<p>The fact that the meeting on Sunday with Kim was more than perfunctory suggests that Trump, for all his bluster, is aware that a mere photo op could not guarantee his image as master dealmaker all the way up to the November 2020 presidential election. There had to be some substance, and that would require repairing the damage done in Hanoi.</p> \n<p>The summit in the Vietnamese capital broke down because the working group talks in the run-up had led Kim \u2013 and most observers \u2013 to believe the US was open to a step-by-step plan, in which North Korea would dismantle some of its extensive nuclear programme, part of the complex in Yongbyon, for example, in return for relaxing sanctions.</p> \n<p>On the first evening of the Hanoi summit, however, Trump took Kim by surprise by presenting a comprehensive, all-for-all, proposal, advocated by Bolton and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.</p> \n<p>The gambit was a flop. Rather than discombobulating Kim into giving up concessions, the North Korean leader was spooked and dug in his heels the next morning. The parties packed their bags early, leaving a ceremonial lunch uneaten on the table.</p> \n<p>Trump repeated on Sunday that he wanted a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d deal, but also hinted heavily he was ready to go back to a phased approach, suggesting some sanctions could be lifted in the course of negotiations, not only at the end.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt some point during the negotiation, things can happen,\u201d Trump said after his meeting. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be talking about sanctions.\u201d</p> \n<p>The man who will be leading the US team to the working groups talks will be Stephen Biegun, the same special envoy who was negotiating the step-by-step approach before Hanoi and Trump\u2019s abrupt change of course. Trump said Kim was \u201cputting somebody in charge [of the North Korean team] who we know and who we like\u201d. But he did not say who that was.</p> \n<p>No wonder Kim looked so much happier at the DMZ than in Hanoi. He achieved something his father and grandfather had dreamed of: an actual serving US president on North Korean territory \u2013 20 metres of it, at least.</p> \n<p>Trump declared it \u201can honour\u201d and suggested Kim would be welcome in the White House. This has been the strategic goal of the regime all along, to gain international acceptance as a nuclear-armed state.</p> \n<p>That strategy means that Kim has no intention of disarming, but he could accept limits on his arsenal \u2013 arms control rather than denuclearisation. That will be tough for Trump. It will involve climbing down from his Hanoi posture.</p> \n<p>And such a deal would be demonstrably worse than the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, which Trump withdrew from and is trying to destroy. In that deal, Tehran is not allowed to get within a year of making a single nuclear weapon.</p> \n<p>For such talks to succeed, Bolton might not only have to be excluded from the DMZ but from the White House, too. Far stranger things have happened in this administration and the fact that the president referred to his national security adviser more than once on Sunday as \u201cMike\u201d Bolton may be a sign.</p> \n<p>But if Trump does have second thoughts on doing a deal, Kim will know how to turn up the pressure: launch a missile during a campaign rally.</p> \n<p>That will be the battle of wits in the next phase. For the time being, as Trump said when he thanked Kim for turning up at short notice and mugging for the jostling photographers around them: \u201cYou made us both look good.\u201d</p>",

The question, as ever, is whether they will lead anywhere. There is no question that Trump\u2019s motives for calling the meeting, at a day\u2019s notice, were primarily electoral. Throughout the day, Trump grumbled repeatedly about how he had not been given enough credit from the press for defusing tensions on the Korean peninsula. His own narrative cut a few corners to say the least, omitting to mention that the most dangerous moments \u2013 North Korea\u2019s test of a hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and his own threats of \u201cfire and fury\u201d \u2013 all happened in his first year in office. He insisted that all North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile tests had ceased, by declaring that the short-range solid-fuel missile tests in May were not actually tests. He did not explain. The DMZ meeting was all about shaping a narrative. That is why John Bolton, the ultra-hawkish national security adviser, was nowhere to be seen; he had been sent, or sent himself, to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. But the official US party included Tucker Carlson, a Fox News talkshow host, who is Trump\u2019s principal channel to the non-interventionist section of his far-right base. Eleventh-hour conversations with Carlson reportedly persuaded Trump not to launch missiles against Iran this month, after the downing of a US drone. The fact that the meeting on Sunday with Kim was more than perfunctory suggests that Trump, for all his bluster, is aware that a mere photo op could not guarantee his image as master dealmaker all the way up to the November 2020 presidential election. There had to be some substance, and that would require repairing the damage done in Hanoi. The summit in the Vietnamese capital broke down because the working group talks in the run-up had led Kim \u2013 and most observers \u2013 to believe the US was open to a step-by-step plan, in which North Korea would dismantle some of its extensive nuclear programme, part of the complex in Yongbyon, for example, in return for relaxing sanctions. On the first evening of the Hanoi summit, however, Trump took Kim by surprise by presenting a comprehensive, all-for-all, proposal, advocated by Bolton and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The gambit was a flop. Rather than discombobulating Kim into giving up concessions, the North Korean leader was spooked and dug in his heels the next morning. The parties packed their bags early, leaving a ceremonial lunch uneaten on the table. Trump repeated on Sunday that he wanted a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d deal, but also hinted heavily he was ready to go back to a phased approach, suggesting some sanctions could be lifted in the course of negotiations, not only at the end. \u201cAt some point during the negotiation, things can happen,\u201d Trump said after his meeting. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be talking about sanctions.\u201d The man who will be leading the US team to the working groups talks will be Stephen Biegun, the same special envoy who was negotiating the step-by-step approach before Hanoi and Trump\u2019s abrupt change of course. Trump said Kim was \u201cputting somebody in charge [of the North Korean team] who we know and who we like\u201d. But he did not say who that was. No wonder Kim looked so much happier at the DMZ than in Hanoi. He achieved something his father and grandfather had dreamed of: an actual serving US president on North Korean territory \u2013 20 metres of it, at least. Trump declared it \u201can honour\u201d and suggested Kim would be welcome in the White House. This has been the strategic goal of the regime all along, to gain international acceptance as a nuclear-armed state. That strategy means that Kim has no intention of disarming, but he could accept limits on his arsenal \u2013 arms control rather than denuclearisation. That will be tough for Trump. It will involve climbing down from his Hanoi posture. And such a deal would be demonstrably worse than the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, which Trump withdrew from and is trying to destroy. In that deal, Tehran is not allowed to get within a year of making a single nuclear weapon. For such talks to succeed, Bolton might not only have to be excluded from the DMZ but from the White House, too. Far stranger things have happened in this administration and the fact that the president referred to his national security adviser more than once on Sunday as \u201cMike\u201d Bolton may be a sign. But if Trump does have second thoughts on doing a deal, Kim will know how to turn up the pressure: launch a missile during a campaign rally. That will be the battle of wits in the next phase. For the time being, as Trump said when he thanked Kim for turning up at short notice and mugging for the jostling photographers around them: \u201cYou made us both look good.\u201d",

According to the documents, FMC Technologies, one of the predecessor firms, used Unaoil to pay bribes to at least seven Iraqi officials at the oil ministry and two state-owned oil companies from 2008 to 2013.

I spend a good bit of time in Shed and I\u2019ve never been hugged so much in my life. But does it make me, in the words of Powers, \u201ca better ally to women\u201d? As I step back out into the afternoon sun, and the melee, feeling woke in my flowery shirt and biodegradable glitter, I am certainly determined to put one slogan \u2013 \u201cBeing kind is never wasted\u201d \u2013 into action. But I\u2019m not quite as woke, perhaps, as the guy in purple fishscale swimming trunks and silk paisley-pattern dressing gown dancing to Craig Charles\u2019s set on the main Shangri-La stage. When I get back to my tent later, it is dark and there is a woman face down on the grass outside. \u201cJust leave me,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re fine now,\u201d I say, \u201cbut you\u2019ll be cold in a while. Let me take you back to your tent.\u201d Eventually, she gets up and I help her find her way through the night. As the party of Glastonbury booms in the distance, I recall another Shed slogan. \u201cIt\u2019s not whether you get knocked down,\u201d the words read, on a happy blue background. \u201cIt\u2019s whether you get up.\u201d",

The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April.

Which is why the marine pilot Josh Clerk\u2019s look is this year\u2019s festival fashion winner. Cap, sunglasses With relentless sun, Glasto-goers need their accessories to work hard this year. The cap and sunglasses tick all the boxes here, with the shades adding steampunk vibes. Matching leopard print Co-ords (two items in matching prints) are a thing for men at Glastonbury. The slightly mismatched leopard here makes it feel a bit cooler and a bit less contrived. Leggings Forget the drainpipes of Love Island, the skintight trouser trend was taken to the next level at Glastonbury this year: men in leggings, particularly printed ones, have been a frequent sight. Trainers and socks A white sports sock could be a bold move at a muddy Glastonbury, but not in 29C heat. These socks celebrate that dry ground. See also: lots of sandals and even pedicured toes. Beer A five-day party in the sun requires that classic summer accessory: an ice-cold beer.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cBeing away from my usual training regime does get to me,\u201d says Louis Jensen, a 31-year-old artist manager and producer from London. \u201cA sense of panic arises about how my body will look and feel after three days of no gym access and lack of food options. Being able to keep fit and healthy is a challenge.\u201d Glastonbury may have a reputation for more hedonistic pursuits than HIIT routines, but that hasn\u2019t deterred festivalgoers such as Jensen from doing what they can to keep in shape. By Saturday morning, he had already completed two 15km runs and did another 10km on Sunday, along with an extensive daily regime of exercises. He is also on a strict diet of juice and soup, and doesn\u2019t plan on having any \u201ccheat days\u201d. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a pretty heavy regime,\u201d he says, \u201cit just doesn\u2019t cut it fully for me. I need weights, I need my bike to ride for my quads,\u201d he says. \u201cI struggle mentally to see the gains I desire without my full exercise equipment, so there can\u2019t be any days off while I\u2019m here.\u201d It helps that there are numerous exercise groups over the weekend, from a 5km organised run on the Thursday (which 105 people took part in), to numerous yoga classes of varying disciplines, from laughing to power ballad. Ali Jackson, a 41-year-old substance misuse worker based in Stoke, is running a 100km ultra marathon with her partner next month, so keeping fit at Glastonbury is essential. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to undo all the hard work,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay as fit as we can while we\u2019re here.\u201d So far, Jackson has taken part in the 5k run and covered five miles in her six-hour litter-picking shift, which started at 6am. She has also brought protein powder with her and has been trying to eat healthily. \u201cThere\u2019s so much lovely food here, it would be easy to go mad,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m on a programme with a nutritionist and he said a week of bingeing could do a lot of damage.\u201d For Carrie Hall, running also has social and practical benefits, considering this is her first time at Glastonbury. \u201cI thought it would be a really cool way to get to see different things,\u201d she says. As well as taking part in the 5km \u2013 one of the highlights of her weekend \u2013 she has also scaled the climbing wall. No mean feat in 27C heat. Becki Clark, a 25-year-old junior doctor, has been running every day so far. Although she has found the heat limiting, she has also managed to play football with her friends. For her, it is not about fitness. \u201cRunning is what I do, it\u2019s how I keep sane, it\u2019s how I deal with stress, how I deal with everything. It\u2019s the best way to start a day.\u201d When Clark was at Glastonbury in 2017, she didn\u2019t run and was left feeling lethargic and stressed.

On top of that I\u2019ve got my Airgo mattress. It\u2019s self-inflating \u2013 you leave it for about 10 minutes. I use vacuum pack bags to squash all my clothes down; that pillow then becomes about a third of its size. I\u2019ve got a box underneath which has got all of my toiletries and bits and pieces, so that I can find them. On the lid of the box, I put all my clothes, so that I can just slide it out. I brought a washing line so that we can dry our towels and bikinis. My friends said: \u2018Zoe, why would you bring a washing line?\u2019 Now they all want to use it. It cost me \u00a31. Our friends have a camper van that they\u2019ve driven in \u2013 we did a Tescos order to their house, so they\u2019re bringing all our alcohol for us. The car air freshener, I packed by accident. But it makes the tent smell nice.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018My daughter said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you brought muesli\u2019</strong><br><strong>Delyth Pritchard, Cardiff</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c3240f18916df7392c120c8aca454d4855eadd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c3240f18916df7392c120c8aca454d4855eadd1/0_0_6394_4263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delyth Pritchard with Dave Bland, from Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delyth Pritchard with Dave Bland, from Cardiff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s our first year at Glastonbury without our children. The oldest is 23 \u2013 she\u2019s flitting between two camps. The youngest is down there somewhere [gestures vaguely]. She\u2019s far too cool to be seen with us. My eldest said: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve got muesli here.\u2019 The trick is not bringing loads of stuff, because you have to walk with it. We\u2019re quite pared down this year because we have coach tickets \u2013 normally we would drive and bring more gear. But we have everything we need. The process is to get the tent up, get the bed inflated, throw the stuff about inside and then have a wander, see what\u2019s changed. We always used to be in family camping because we had lots of teenagers with us. It\u2019s quite nice, actually, not having them. It was a bit of a mess last time.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You never know when you might need a panda hat\u2019</strong><br><strong>Matthew Thorrington-Smith, Cape Town, South Africa</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13ee26dc12abc2df5c15246735ab75ec84f8a891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13ee26dc12abc2df5c15246735ab75ec84f8a891/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Thorrington Smith inside his tent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew Thorrington Smith inside his tent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an evolving process. Dynamic. The logic was to have things that I most often need easily accessible at the front of the tent. So there\u2019s clothing. A bag of various dress-up things: tattoo sleeves, South African flag \u2013 we\u2019re having a South African-themed day tomorrow \u2013 panda hat. You never know when you might need one. Then we move on to food, all of which has been carefully selected. It\u2019s important to get a good calorie-per-square-centimetre ratio, so we have peanut butter, protein bars, nuts, chocolate. Then alcohol: two litres of gin, two litres of vodka, cordial. I\u2019ve got two Camelbaks (a rucksack with a liquid reservoir). One\u2019s for water. This one\u2019s got gin and cordial \u2013 a classic combo. Then there\u2019s a bag of dirty clothes and toiletries right at the back. I created this system on the fly. It maintains itself for the most part: you take something, you put it back in one of the piles. My friends will tell you I\u2019m very quick and efficient.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018This is causing me anxiety\u2019</strong><br><strong>Clare Fourel, </strong><strong>London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"066d8d65f0e351b2f089f40ae0e0a3b9bfe093d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/066d8d65f0e351b2f089f40ae0e0a3b9bfe093d0/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bertie Dixon and Clare Fourel inside their tent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bertie Dixon and Clare Fourel inside their tent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOnly the sleeping mat and your valuables are allowed in the tent.

If I don\u2019t have that, then I start to get anxious. So this is causing me anxiety right now. There\u2019s been a system breakdown. Something was lost, so then I had to go away, and the thing had to be found, and it was found.

      "bodyText": "Marie Kondo calls her widely acclaimed process of folding, throwing things out and finding domestic order a \u201ctidying festival\u201d. As in: \u201ccan\u2019t this weekend, sorry, I\u2019m having a tidying festival.\u201d But how does it work at an actual festival? Campers at Glastonbury took us inside their tents to talk us through their personal organising systems. \u2018After three airbeds burst in three nights, I bought a double bed frame\u2019 Zoe Jones, Didcot, Oxfordshire \u201cAfter bursting three airbeds in three nights at Reading festival, I don\u2019t do sleeping on the hard ground, so I bought myself a double bed frame to have a bit of comfort. On top of that I\u2019ve got my Airgo mattress. It\u2019s self-inflating \u2013 you leave it for about 10 minutes. I use vacuum pack bags to squash all my clothes down; that pillow then becomes about a third of its size. I\u2019ve got a box underneath which has got all of my toiletries and bits and pieces, so that I can find them. On the lid of the box, I put all my clothes, so that I can just slide it out. I brought a washing line so that we can dry our towels and bikinis. My friends said: \u2018Zoe, why would you bring a washing line?\u2019 Now they all want to use it. It cost me \u00a31. Our friends have a camper van that they\u2019ve driven in \u2013 we did a Tescos order to their house, so they\u2019re bringing all our alcohol for us. The car air freshener, I packed by accident. But it makes the tent smell nice.\u201d \u2018My daughter said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you brought muesli\u2019 Delyth Pritchard, Cardiff \u201cIt\u2019s our first year at Glastonbury without our children. The oldest is 23 \u2013 she\u2019s flitting between two camps. The youngest is down there somewhere [gestures vaguely]. She\u2019s far too cool to be seen with us. My eldest said: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve got muesli here.\u2019 The trick is not bringing loads of stuff, because you have to walk with it. We\u2019re quite pared down this year because we have coach tickets \u2013 normally we would drive and bring more gear. But we have everything we need. The process is to get the tent up, get the bed inflated, throw the stuff about inside and then have a wander, see what\u2019s changed. We always used to be in family camping because we had lots of teenagers with us. It\u2019s quite nice, actually, not having them. It was a bit of a mess last time.\u201d \u2018You never know when you might need a panda hat\u2019 Matthew Thorrington-Smith, Cape Town, South Africa \u201cIt\u2019s an evolving process. Dynamic. The logic was to have things that I most often need easily accessible at the front of the tent. So there\u2019s clothing. A bag of various dress-up things: tattoo sleeves, South African flag \u2013 we\u2019re having a South African-themed day tomorrow \u2013 panda hat. You never know when you might need one. Then we move on to food, all of which has been carefully selected. It\u2019s important to get a good calorie-per-square-centimetre ratio, so we have peanut butter, protein bars, nuts, chocolate. Then alcohol: two litres of gin, two litres of vodka, cordial. I\u2019ve got two Camelbaks (a rucksack with a liquid reservoir). One\u2019s for water. This one\u2019s got gin and cordial \u2013 a classic combo. Then there\u2019s a bag of dirty clothes and toiletries right at the back. I created this system on the fly. It maintains itself for the most part: you take something, you put it back in one of the piles. My friends will tell you I\u2019m very quick and efficient.\u201d \u2018This is causing me anxiety\u2019 Clare Fourel, London \u201cOnly the sleeping mat and your valuables are allowed in the tent. It\u2019s like, order of needs: why do you need to be in the tent? It\u2019s to sleep. I\u2019ve got to have clothes closest and shoes farthest way. If I don\u2019t have that, then I start to get anxious. So this is causing me anxiety right now. There\u2019s been a system breakdown. Something was lost, so then I had to go away, and the thing had to be found, and it was found. We live on a narrow boat, so it\u2019s a similar thing \u2013 you have to have everything in its place, in boxes. Usually you tidy in the morning. But when you come back at night and you\u2019re a bit pissed, you\u2019re not thinking straight \u2013 it\u2019s all over the place, and you have to retrace your steps.\u201d \u2018The sheet masks are a Saturday treat. It\u2019s a bit bougie\u2019 Isabelle Bascombe, London \u201cI need a lot of space to get ready, so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve left this big gap here. Over there is the snack station.

The company, which manages the UK\u2019s 20,000 miles of rail tracks, said it made the bid to avoid the possibility of losing one of its most important suppliers. The British railway system is heavily dependent on British Steel, which accounts for 97% of the steel used in railway tracks. Greybull Capital, the private equity investor under which British Steel collapsed, confirmed on Sunday that it was also interested in a bid for parts of the company if a buyer for the entire operation could not be found. Potential bidders had until the end of Sunday to make offers, although it is understood that bids that came in after that point would still be considered. About a dozen companies were thought to have expressed interest in buying all or parts of the business, after 80 parties made preliminary enquiries. Potential buyers reportedly include India\u2019s JSW and Evraz, a Russian steel and metals conglomerate part-owned by Roman Abramovich. The sale process is not expected to conclude this week, as discussions continue between bidders and the government Insolvency Service\u2019s official receiver.

A bid by Greybull for parts of the business, which could include British Steel\u2019s Dutch or French operations, would be highly controversial. Greybull said it had been the only party willing to step in to save the Scunthorpe plant in 2016, keeping it running. The spokesman said: \u201cWhile we tried to create a viable long-term business, the challenging economic environment and the uncertainty caused by Brexit made that unattainable. \u201cEY are conducting a worldwide search for parties willing to invest in the entire group.

They also back the opening singer, Donna Byrne, who\u2019s at best a cruise-ship crooner, her voice a maudlin blancmange, wobbling in all the right places but never making the songs hers.</p> <p>By contrast, Bennett\u2019s voice, once so smooth, has weathered over recent years, growing raspy, yellowing like old newspaper, and not always able to hit every note of his melodies. But while this mars a sprightly I\u2019ve Got Rhythm, this aged quality, this vulnerability \u2013 Bennett\u2019s very 92-ness \u2013 lend new poignancy to these songs. The setlist seems hand-picked for wry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/older-people\">references to age</a> \u2013 Bennett laughs gently after singing \u201cAs I approach the prime of my life,\u201d in This Is All I Ask, and requesting: \u201cBeautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me.\u201d But he\u2019s not only poking fun at his advanced years; there\u2019s a sadness, too, the weight of the years passing, so his voice breaks as he sings \u201cI will stay younger than spring\u201d, with a yearning for this to be true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eb8be2a3c21c973de9bd1be4038309865fcbce7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eb8be2a3c21c973de9bd1be4038309865fcbce7/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Upbeat \u2026 Tony Bennett and his quartet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Upbeat \u2026 Tony Bennett and his quartet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weaved among his more upbeat standards, these darker, more impassioned moments are perhaps unexpectedly resonant; Duke Ellington\u2019s (In My) Solitude is brittle and moving, Bennett taunted \u201cby memories that never die\u201d, while James Ingram\u2019s How Do You Keep the Music Playing? takes on a new meaning as he sings \u201cHow do you keep the song from fading?\u201d, clearly reluctant to relinquish the stage that he loves. Deftly escorted there by his quartet, he reaches closing crescendos of torch song emotion that are almost operatic, and anything but easy listening.</p> <p>He closes with Fly Me to the Moon, and if the subtlety of his voice is gone, the power remains. And while pretenders-to-the-throne like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-buble\">Bubl\u00e9</a> might deliver such songs with a polish now beyond Bennett\u2019s reach, they can\u2019t sing them as if they\u2019ve lived every word of them, every last disappointment and fleeting spark of love, the way Tony does tonight. That he can do it at all, at his age, is remarkable enough; that his cheating of the final curtain is so moving and ultimately joyous tonight makes Bennett treasurable. </p>",

By contrast, Bennett\u2019s voice, once so smooth, has weathered over recent years, growing raspy, yellowing like old newspaper, and not always able to hit every note of his melodies. But while this mars a sprightly I\u2019ve Got Rhythm, this aged quality, this vulnerability \u2013 Bennett\u2019s very 92-ness \u2013 lend new poignancy to these songs. The setlist seems hand-picked for wry references to age \u2013 Bennett laughs gently after singing \u201cAs I approach the prime of my life,\u201d in This Is All I Ask, and requesting: \u201cBeautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me.\u201d But he\u2019s not only poking fun at his advanced years; there\u2019s a sadness, too, the weight of the years passing, so his voice breaks as he sings \u201cI will stay younger than spring\u201d, with a yearning for this to be true. Weaved among his more upbeat standards, these darker, more impassioned moments are perhaps unexpectedly resonant; Duke Ellington\u2019s (In My) Solitude is brittle and moving, Bennett taunted \u201cby memories that never die\u201d, while James Ingram\u2019s How Do You Keep the Music Playing? takes on a new meaning as he sings \u201cHow do you keep the song from fading?\u201d, clearly reluctant to relinquish the stage that he loves. Deftly escorted there by his quartet, he reaches closing crescendos of torch song emotion that are almost operatic, and anything but easy listening. He closes with Fly Me to the Moon, and if the subtlety of his voice is gone, the power remains. And while pretenders-to-the-throne like Bubl\u00e9 might deliver such songs with a polish now beyond Bennett\u2019s reach, they can\u2019t sing them as if they\u2019ve lived every word of them, every last disappointment and fleeting spark of love, the way Tony does tonight. That he can do it at all, at his age, is remarkable enough; that his cheating of the final curtain is so moving and ultimately joyous tonight makes Bennett treasurable.",

The market was ripe, she thought, or at least ripening, because she had noticed houseplants appearing more frequently online. And she was right. In the years since the Sill launched, business has grown month by month, in tandem with the increased standing of the houseplant as an arbiter of millennial taste. The American gardening industry alone is now worth $48bn, <a href=\"https://garden.org/\" title=\"\">according to the National Gardening Association</a>. That is big business and it is getting bigger. Younger fingers in particular are becoming greener.

In 2015 Blackett launched <a href=\"https://www.patchplants.com/gb/en/\" title=\"\">Patch</a>, an online platform that sells houseplants to homes in London. By his own admission, he had few horticultural credentials before setting Patch up, but he too sensed an opportunity: how the millennial interest in technology, wellness, the climate and interior design might converge to transform the houseplant into a valuable commodity. Last year, Blackett sold 120,000 plants, more than 320 a day, and created a video series that helps customers care for their recent purchases. In my experience, the videos have gone viral in a kind of traditional sense. They pop up in my Instagram feed like troublesome weeds.</p> <p>In the millennial mode, the Patch website is easy to use but idiosyncratic enough to be inviting and the brand\u2019s packaging is elegant and simple. The same is true of the Sill. Sometimes the delivery is as much a draw as the product itself. In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwlUEk-_-Wk\" title=\"\">unboxing video</a> posted online, one YouTuber described a package as \u201ckinda big\u201d but \u201creally cool\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re in a new era of e-commerce,\u201d the YouTuber says, with excitement, \u201cwhere everyone is questioning what can and can\u2019t we ship through the mail. The Sill is proving that you can ship a beautiful houseplant to you safe and sound!\u201d A message on the delivery reads: \u201cPlants Make People Happy.\u201d</p> <p>Both the Sill and Patch focus a large part of their marketing on a curious fiction: that plants are somehow active care-givers, able to alleviate all sorts of modern ills: anxiety, loneliness, indoor air pollution, the problem of great social-media content. An article posted on the Sill\u2019s website titled, <a href=\"https://www.thesill.com/blogs/care-miscellaneous/why-you-need-plants-in-your-life\" title=\"\">\u201cWhy You Need Plants in Your Life\u201d</a> includes a list of benefits that the brand says are backed by scientific studies. In an age of mental fatigue, houseplants \u201cboost mood, productivity, concentration and creativity\u201d. In an era of climate disaster, they \u201cclean indoor air by absorbing toxins\u201d. As work continues to define us, they \u201creduce stress\u201d, and can prevent \u201csore throats and colds\u201d. Plants \u201care therapeutic,\u201d one line reads, \u201cand cheaper than a therapist\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A arge part of their marketing is on the curious fiction that plants are somehow active care-givers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This language is savvy enough to acknowledge the fact that millennials, craving comfort, have been widely reported to be relying on houseplants to fill a vacuum. We are struggling to connect with each other. We are struggling to connect with our planet, which is not-so-gradually falling to pieces. We are invited to think: might a houseplant help?</p> <p>Blackett, in a clever early move, decided to baptise Patch products with human names \u2013 Chaz, the Swiss cheese plant (from \u00a314); Fidel, the fiddle-leaf fig (from \u00a312) \u2013 so as to rely less on Latin terms, which he worried might become a stumbling block for consumers, but also, you\u2019d have thought, to suggest a more personal connection between houseplant and owner. Somehow, not long ago, the phrase \u201cplant parenthood\u201d, often prefixed with a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/plantparenthoodph/?hl=en\" title=\"\">hashtag</a>, entered the lexicon as a legitimate term. It is no longer unusual to nourish and attend to a parlour palm as if it were offspring. \u201cMy fussy calatheas are starting to get brown tips because they lack humidity,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mannsterr/status/1141542363682131968\" title=\"\">one Twitter user wrote recently</a>. \u201cI mean, seriously girls? It\u2019s been hella humid!\u201d</p> <p>Can a houseplant fill so big a void? The answer, really, is hardly. A peace lily will never replace a partner, nor a child, nor even a pet (though sometimes you wonder). As far as I\u2019m aware, no proud plant parent has launched an Instagram account dedicated to his cute monstera, in the way pet lovers frequently do for their animal dependents. And it\u2019s doubtful whether a houseplant can affect the air to the degree necessary to create human benefit, though the marketeers will try to sell you on it. </p> <p>Both Patch and the Sill include links to lists of \u201cair-purifying plants\u201d \u2013 \u201cGrow your own fresh air\u201d \u2013 though neither seems to agree on which plants are most purifying. \u201cIn theory, the claims are true,\u201d Curtis Gubb, a PhD student in environmental health at the University of Birmingham, who is investigating how effective housplants are at removing harmful indoor pollutants, told me. Plants have been found to remove all kinds of pollutants, he said, \u201cbut just because a plant removes something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s affecting the room. You\u2019d need 100 plants in a small room,\u201d to have a significant effect. He added that, really, houseplants are \u201cvery unlikely to clean the air.\u201d The science, he says, is well behind the claims.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most of us can agree plants are good, fundamental to our existence somehow, though often the benefits are subjective</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most of us can agree that plants are good, fundamental to our existence somehow, though often the benefits are subjective. In a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/opinion/sunday/oliver-sacks-gardens.html\" title=\"\">recently published essay</a>, the late neurologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/30/oliver-sacks\" title=\"\">Oliver Sacks</a> praised the \u201chealing power of gardens\u201d. \u201cAs a physician, I take my patients to gardens whenever possible,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn 40 years of medical practice, I have found only two types of non-pharmaceutical \u2018therapy\u2019 to be vitally important for patients with chronic neurological diseases: music and gardens.\u201d A line on the Sill reads: \u201cEven brief exposure to nature has been shown to make us more altruistic and co-operative,\u201d and later, presumably to hammer home the point: \u201cIt\u2019s true when we say plants make people happy.\u201d</p> <p>A few months ago, I ordered a peace lily from Patch. It arrived wrapped in plastic and planted in a distressed ceramic pot I\u2019d bought as an add-on. I placed it immediately in my bathroom, because I\u2019d read somewhere, rightly or wrongly, that it would thrive in all that after-shower humidity. When a couple of weeks later I went on holiday with my family, strict care instructions were given to my neighbour. To my surprise, the plant was the first thing I checked when we arrived home. Was it still alive? Had it missed me? Yes, it was thriving \u2013 my neighbour had done an excellent job of not killing it. And, no, of course it hadn\u2019t missed me. I am not too proud to admit I felt a little disgruntled. I might need the plant, I thought, but the plant does not need me.</p>",

In an age of mental fatigue, houseplants \u201cboost mood, productivity, concentration and creativity\u201d. In an era of climate disaster, they \u201cclean indoor air by absorbing toxins\u201d. As work continues to define us, they \u201creduce stress\u201d, and can prevent \u201csore throats and colds\u201d. Plants \u201care therapeutic,\u201d one line reads, \u201cand cheaper than a therapist\u201d. This language is savvy enough to acknowledge the fact that millennials, craving comfort, have been widely reported to be relying on houseplants to fill a vacuum. We are struggling to connect with each other. We are struggling to connect with our planet, which is not-so-gradually falling to pieces. We are invited to think: might a houseplant help? Blackett, in a clever early move, decided to baptise Patch products with human names \u2013 Chaz, the Swiss cheese plant (from \u00a314); Fidel, the fiddle-leaf fig (from \u00a312) \u2013 so as to rely less on Latin terms, which he worried might become a stumbling block for consumers, but also, you\u2019d have thought, to suggest a more personal connection between houseplant and owner. Somehow, not long ago, the phrase \u201cplant parenthood\u201d, often prefixed with a hashtag, entered the lexicon as a legitimate term. It is no longer unusual to nourish and attend to a parlour palm as if it were offspring. \u201cMy fussy calatheas are starting to get brown tips because they lack humidity,\u201d one Twitter user wrote recently. \u201cI mean, seriously girls? It\u2019s been hella humid!\u201d Can a houseplant fill so big a void? The answer, really, is hardly. A peace lily will never replace a partner, nor a child, nor even a pet (though sometimes you wonder). As far as I\u2019m aware, no proud plant parent has launched an Instagram account dedicated to his cute monstera, in the way pet lovers frequently do for their animal dependents. And it\u2019s doubtful whether a houseplant can affect the air to the degree necessary to create human benefit, though the marketeers will try to sell you on it. Both Patch and the Sill include links to lists of \u201cair-purifying plants\u201d \u2013 \u201cGrow your own fresh air\u201d \u2013 though neither seems to agree on which plants are most purifying. \u201cIn theory, the claims are true,\u201d Curtis Gubb, a PhD student in environmental health at the University of Birmingham, who is investigating how effective housplants are at removing harmful indoor pollutants, told me. Plants have been found to remove all kinds of pollutants, he said, \u201cbut just because a plant removes something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s affecting the room. You\u2019d need 100 plants in a small room,\u201d to have a significant effect. He added that, really, houseplants are \u201cvery unlikely to clean the air.\u201d The science, he says, is well behind the claims. Most of us can agree that plants are good, fundamental to our existence somehow, though often the benefits are subjective. In a recently published essay, the late neurologist Oliver Sacks praised the \u201chealing power of gardens\u201d. \u201cAs a physician, I take my patients to gardens whenever possible,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn 40 years of medical practice, I have found only two types of non-pharmaceutical \u2018therapy\u2019 to be vitally important for patients with chronic neurological diseases: music and gardens.\u201d A line on the Sill reads: \u201cEven brief exposure to nature has been shown to make us more altruistic and co-operative,\u201d and later, presumably to hammer home the point: \u201cIt\u2019s true when we say plants make people happy.\u201d A few months ago, I ordered a peace lily from Patch. It arrived wrapped in plastic and planted in a distressed ceramic pot I\u2019d bought as an add-on. I placed it immediately in my bathroom, because I\u2019d read somewhere, rightly or wrongly, that it would thrive in all that after-shower humidity. When a couple of weeks later I went on holiday with my family, strict care instructions were given to my neighbour. To my surprise, the plant was the first thing I checked when we arrived home. Was it still alive? Had it missed me? Yes, it was thriving \u2013 my neighbour had done an excellent job of not killing it. And, no, of course it hadn\u2019t missed me. I am not too proud to admit I felt a little disgruntled. I might need the plant, I thought, but the plant does not need me.",

      "body": "<p>It takes a little over two hours to drive from Multan, a city in southern Punjab, Pakistan, to the village of Shah Sadar Din, and the first time the journalist Sanam Maher made the journey, her eyes widened at every turn. In Dera Ghazi Khan, a town close to the village, none of the faces of the women she saw on the streets were visible. Some wore what looked like black ski masks with slits for their eyes. Others were covered by burqas with no eye-slits at all and so extensive that she felt half naked under her own dupatta (scarf). A thin funnel rises from the top of this kind of burqa: a device to allow air inside so that the wearer does not suffocate. Her contact in the town, noticing her staring, mentioned a place not far away, where the tribal belt of Balochistan province starts: the women there, he told her, were not given shoes. She was confused. Why not? \u201cYou\u2019ll never look at any man if you\u2019re scared of where your naked foot might fall when you leave your home,\u201d he replied impatiently, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I went to her village, it struck me just how big a deal it was for a woman to get out of that situation</p> <footer> <cite>Sanam Maher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Maher, who is based in Karachi, was in Shah Sadar Din to investigate the life and death of Fouzia Azeem, AKA Qandeel Baloch, Pakistan\u2019s first social media celebrity and the woman some like to describe as its Kim Kardashian. Baloch was born here, the daughter of a poor family, and when she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/pakistan-social-media-star-qandeel-baloch-brother-killer-blood-money-law\" title=\"\">murdered</a> on 15 July, 2016, her body was supposed to end up in the village\u2019s brown river, a spot well known for being the final resting place of women who have died at the hands of their relatives in so-called \u201chonour\u201d killings. On the day in question, however, there were too many people around to manage this (another villager had died; crowds of mourners were gathering). Baloch\u2019s mother found the body at home; her father informed the authorities. When the police arrived, Baloch was still lying where she had been drugged and asphyxiated, in a bedroom at the small house that she rented for her parents in Multan. She was just 26.</p> <p>\u201cVisiting Shah Sadar Din was a huge culture shock for me,\u201d says Maher, whose book about the case, <em>A Woman Like Her</em>, is published in the UK next month (it has already caused something of a sensation in south Asia). \u201cThe women were so completely covered: I\u2019d never seen that anywhere that I\u2019d lived or worked. But it\u2019s important to say straight off that, though this is typical of south Punjab, it has nothing at all to do with religion. These [dress codes] are cultural diktats, just as honour killing and other forms of violence against women are cultural diktats. This is men wanting to control how the women around them live.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"62af79c344fa3d5739f583ec338fb4c82c84563d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62af79c344fa3d5739f583ec338fb4c82c84563d/0_0_335_395/335.jpg\" alt=\"A selfie from Qandeel Baloch\u2019s Facebook page.\" width=\"335\" height=\"395\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A selfie from Qandeel Baloch\u2019s Facebook page.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FACEBOOK/QANDEEL BALOCH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maher had become interested in writing about Baloch because she felt that her life was a good, if rather extreme, example of the tensions that currently exist for the young in Pakistan; of the difference between where they find themselves in society, and where they would like to be. As she puts it: \u201cMy generation is connected to the world in ways that previous generations never were, and because of that we aspire to live and to behave and dress in certain ways. Yet we\u2019re also rooted in a physical space that doesn\u2019t necessarily allow for those aspirations.\u201d But now, in Shah Sadar Din, she saw something else. \u201cI was amazed by Baloch\u2019s gumption. When I went to her village, it struck me almost for the first time just how big a deal it was for a woman to get out of that situation.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to put her on a pedestal in my book; I want people to make up their own minds about her. But I remain amazed by her, and it is very cool to be getting messages from readers across Asia telling me that, though they\u2019d begun by wondering why I wanted to write about someone they saw as trashy, they now have real compassion for her.\u201d</p> <p>Qandeel Baloch first came to public attention in 2013, when she auditioned for the reality singing show, <em>Pakistan Idol</em>. Though she wasn\u2019t chosen by the judges, who mocked her high-pitched voice, her performance \u2013 and the tears she supposedly shed on being eliminated \u2013 soon went viral. Thanks to this, she began to pick up occasional media work: modelling jobs, appearances on chat shows, gigs plugging products on her Facebook page. But how to sustain people\u2019s interest? As a young woman with few contacts, no money and not much obvious talent, her only option was to exploit social media, something at which she turned out to be highly adept. In 2015, for instance, a scrappy but rather pert 20-second video she made of herself known as How I\u2019m Looking? resulted in her inclusion in Google\u2019s list of the top 10 most searched for Pakistanis online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ae4071ae496ad52c25a7d5ea4e5bfd6b240df30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ae4071ae496ad52c25a7d5ea4e5bfd6b240df30/0_0_2879_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Qandeel Baloch speaks during a press conference in Lahore in June 2016, less than three weeks before her murder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Qandeel Baloch speaks during a press conference in Lahore in June 2016, less than three weeks before her murder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M Jameel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are more than 44 million users of social media in Pakistan, but the addicts among them are (this is the same the world over) easily bored. People scroll and scroll, and then move on. Baloch had no choice but to repeatedly up the ante if she wanted her followers to keep talking about her, and if this meant pushing against the boundaries of what was acceptable in Pakistan, it was a risk she was willing to take; opprobrium, after all, was just another form of fame. In October 2015, when Imran Khan, the former cricketer who is now Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, announced the end of his second marriage, Baloch launched an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbeMjaYwTwk\" title=\"\">online campaign </a>to become wife number three (every TV channel screened her \u201cpress conference\u201d). The following February, she released a message in which she denounced those conservatives in Pakistan who regarded the celebration of Valentine\u2019s Day as un-Islamic. In March, she offered to perform a striptease for Shahid Afridi, the captain of the Pakistani national cricket team, if the side beat India in the World Twenty20 Cup. Finally, in April, she appeared on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0anV5baq5DQ\" title=\"\">comedy news show </a>with a 50-year-old mullah, Mufti Abdul Qavi.</p> <p>The cleric, something of a media star himself, did not rise to the bait offered by the show\u2019s presenter, who asked him what he thought of her offer to Afridi (he also wondered aloud if striptease might not be a useful weapon in the national effort to deradicalise Islamic militants). But Qavi did say that he would like to meet Baloch again the next time he was in Karachi, where she was living by then. It isn\u2019t clear, now, which of them made sure his seemingly throwaway request became a reality, but what we do know is that in June, Baloch released images of a meeting with the cleric that had taken place in a hotel room. In one, she poses in Qavi\u2019s distinctive cap, her mouth open in a wide \u2018O\u2019 that suggests a certain disrespectful naughtiness on both their parts. In a short video, meanwhile, Qavi can be heard announcing that he intends, in the future, to offer her religious guidance.</p> <p>In this moment, the die was cast for Baloch, for all that she would later insist that Qavi had behaved inappropriately towards her, and that he was \u201ca blot\u201d on the name of Islam. The encounter triggered a media storm, the main consequence of which was that the press was now determined to find out more about her. Things she had long kept hidden \u2013 not only her real name, and her humble background, but also the fact that she had run away from an arranged marriage to her cousin, seeking sanctuary in a refuge, and was now divorced and forbidden to see her son, Mishal \u2013 were soon revealed to a transfixed public. \u201cHere was a woman who managed to fool everyone,\u201d says Maher. \u201cShe had created a persona that we all completely bought into.\u201d Meanwhile, back in her village, people began to torment the youngest of her six brothers, Waseem. They would come into the mobile phone shop that he owned and ask him, sniggering, if he could download his sister\u2019s latest videos for them. In the public confession he made before the press following his arrest the day after his sister\u2019s body was found, he gave as his motive \u201cthe way she was coming on Facebook\u201d. A reporter wanted to know: was he ashamed? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, sticking out his chin. \u201cI have no shame.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUVyz2OQjbc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jUVyz2OQjbc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the Guardian documentary on Qandeel Baloch here.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In her book, Maher traces Baloch\u2019s journey from Shah Sadar Din to unlikely celebrity, uncovering new details of how she pulled off her transformation (for a time, for instance, she worked as a hostess for a Multan bus company, welcoming passengers on board and serving them cardboard containers of biryani). She talks to her parents, Muhammad and Anwar, who initially condemned their son, even calling for him to receive the death penalty, as well as to many others of those who knew her (in all, Maher did 125 interviews while she was researching the story). But she also looks at the wider effects of social media on Pakistani women. Increasingly, men are using it to shame women, and even to blackmail them, by threatening to release images, doctored or otherwise, online if they do not behave as they should. In this sense, the internet is for them just another control mechanism.</p> <p>One story told by Maher sticks in the mind: that of Naila, a 22-year-old university student who killed herself in 2016. No one is certain, but it seems likely that she had discovered that a man she had been involved with had nude pictures of her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7ef23d125adcfc47b65df90973361e46ef9c0c4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ef23d125adcfc47b65df90973361e46ef9c0c4e/1026_0_2527_2732/925.jpg\" alt=\"An unrepentant Waseem Azeem talks to the press following the killing of his sister, July 2016.

Their attitude was: you\u2019re asking for it. But let\u2019s say that you\u2019re in a relationship. You take a slightly suggestive picture, and send it to your boyfriend. Then the relationship fizzles out, and he threatens to send the picture to your family. Who do you go to? No one is sympathetic.\u201d</p> <p>Many women in the UK feel unsafe online. But as Maher points out, the stakes are vastly higher in Pakistan. \u201cIt can very quickly spiral from someone disliking an opinion you have to real violence. It\u2019s really not just a case of words on a screen. This is an exciting time for us. Groups that were previously marginalised \u2013 queer groups, religious minorities \u2013 have found a space online. It is a moment of real freedom. But it comes with real danger. We\u2019re starting to be smarter about online safety, but then, so are the people who don\u2019t like our opinions.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Baloch was murdered, there had already been an estimated 326 so-called \u201chonour\u201d killings in Pakistan in 2016, of which 312 victims were women. Six days after her death, a parliamentary committee approved<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/pakistan-social-media-star-qandeel-baloch-brother-killer-blood-money-law\" title=\"\"> a bill that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/pakistan-social-media-star-qandeel-baloch-brother-killer-blood-money-law\" title=\"\">closed a legal loophole</a> that had allowed relatives of the deceased to pardon perpetrators, or to receive \u201cblood money\u201d as compensation for the crime, enabling the killers to walk free. Since the change in the law, those found guilty will face a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment; relatives of the deceased can only now prevent the killer from receiving a death sentence.</p> <p>Yet still the killings continue. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan estimates that at least 524 such murders occurred between October 2016, when the amendment came into effect, and October 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0822d3467c6b2e13da38abeb2ee4f90232ad10fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0822d3467c6b2e13da38abeb2ee4f90232ad10fe/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Islamabad in July, 2016 following the murder of Qandeel Baloch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters in Islamabad in July, 2016 following the murder of Qandeel Baloc.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf things are really to change, we need a systemic shift in the education system,\u201d says Maher. \u201cChildren need to be taught that this is not a religious thing, and that it can\u2019t be excused on those grounds \u2013 and parents need to teach their sons that they have no more rights than their sisters.\u201d Waseem Azeem remains in prison, but he has not been convicted of Baloch\u2019s murder: \u201cThese cases can get dragged out for years. All we do know is that he can\u2019t get off scot free.\u201d Will his parents save him from the death penalty if a judge decides to impose it? Who knows. But as Maher points out, they now rely entirely on their sons financially \u2013 something that may, in the future, play a part in whatever they decide.</p> <p>For Maher, working on this story wasn\u2019t easy: \u201cAt one point, I said to my editor: every woman in this book is either dead or receiving death threats. It really started to weigh on me.\u201d In Pakistan, many of the bigger book stores have been reluctant to stock <em>A Woman Like Her</em>; others keep it under the counter, as if, she says, \u201cI\u2019d written porn, or something\u201d. But she also understands that she has privileges that her subject could only have dreamed of. \u201cI think about this often,\u201d she says. \u201cI have opportunities that Qandeel didn\u2019t. I have been able to talk to men who thought she deserved to die, and yet I was safe because of my role as a reporter. I got to leave, and go back to my own home. Sometimes, I struggle with this. No one ever asked her to write an op-ed in the <em>New York Times,</em> but [in death] she is getting me all this attention.\u201d</p> <p>What does she think Baloch\u2019s legacy, if any, will be? Is it possible that the murder of this funny, smart yet rather naive young woman \u2013 one who began to talk, towards the end of her life, openly about feminism \u2013 will prove to be some kind of turning point in Pakistan?</p> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not done with her yet,\u201d she says. \u201cThis happened in 2016, and three years on, we\u2019re still talking about her. Women here take great courage from what she said and how she behaved. We tend to have these moments in Pakistan. They\u2019re often, as was the case with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">Malala</a> [Yousafzai, the Nobel laureate, who was shot on a school bus in Pakistan in 2012], brought on by great violence. They\u2019re a moment of reckoning, when we hit pause and ask where we are going? It happened with Qandeel, too. When I see the pictures of women\u2019s marches here, her face is always in the crowd: people wear masks of it. Her legacy is to encourage young men and women to think that if she could speak out, we should all at least try to do the same ourselves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3afd7372ad0301dd02338bd12b089e1598024f4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3afd7372ad0301dd02338bd12b089e1598024f4a/0_112_3600_2199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wear masks depicting Qandeel Baloch, as they take part in a women\u2019s march in Karachi, 8 March 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"611\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People take part in a women\u2019s march wearing masks depicting Qandeel Baloch, Karachi, 8 March 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Extract: A Woman Like Her by Sanam Maher</h2> <p>Fouzia Azeem, otherwise known as Qandeel Baloch, first came to the attention of the public three years before her murder, when she auditioned for <em>Pakistan Idol</em>, the reality singing show, in 2013.</p> <p>Qandeel snaps her fingers and dances and sits on the hood of a car, bouncing her head to the music playing from her mobile phone. \u201cI\u2019m a professional model. I do modelling, shoots, brand shoots,\u201d she explains in a video recorded earlier at what appears to be her home. Her cheeks have been rouged and her eyebrows are swiped with too much dark powder. Her hair, parted down the middle, is pinned on each side with a schoolgirl\u2019s barrettes. \u201cI love singing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a hobby, but a passion. I feel I can be Pakistan\u2019s idol.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? asks the actor judge when Qandeel walks into the room for her audition. \u201cPinky?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQandeel Baloch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I thought maybe it\u2019s Pinky.\u201d The judge points to her outfit. \u201cEverything is pink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look so beautiful,\u201d Qandeel gushes. \u201cI always see you on TV, but mashallah, you look so beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeel free to praise him too, or he\u2019ll get offended,\u201d the actor says, gesturing towards the male judge.</p> <p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s no point praising men; it makes no difference to them,\u201d Qandeel replies.</p> <p>Qandeel says she is nervous. She puts on a little girl\u2019s whining voice, and the judges cajole her to give it her best shot. But when she finally does sing, she is a natural. She isn\u2019t rooted to that oval plastic mat like other contestants. She walks forward, beckoning to the judges with her arms, beseeching them with her words, closing her eyes as she sways. She stares straight into the camera. She isn\u2019t nervous; she is performing.</p> <p>Later, the producers add some effects to the clip. One judge has smoke billowing out of her ears. When Qandeel hits a high note, there is a sound like a spring recoiling. The male judge buries his face in his hands.</p> <p>When they tell her to leave, she strokes the hair falling from those two schoolgirl barrettes and gives a small smile, saying in that little girl\u2019s voice: \u201cDon\u2019t reject me please.\u201d She pouts. \u201cI want to sing some more.\u201d</p> <p>The actor walks over to her and holds her by the shoulders and leads her out. The male judge pretends to cry.</p> <p>\u201cYou fooled me,\u201d Qandeel wails to the cameras waiting outside. \u201cI told my parents I\u2019m doing this audition and they\u2019re so hopeful now. Now what am I going to say to them? They will just think: \u2018They rejected our daughter.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She is on the verge of tears, her breath catching on each word.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Cheer up, okay?\u201d the actor says, patting her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you doing modelling some day.\u201d As she walks away, Qandeel covers her face with both her hands and lets out a wail. The show\u2019s host pushes the mic towards her. She turns back to him, doubling over as she sobs. Her shrieks echo in the hall.</p> <p>There is no one else there. The other contestants have gone away and it is now dark outside. The cameras follow her as she cups her face in her hands, the baby-pink painted nails covering her eyes as she cries all the way out of the door.</p> <p>\u201cPoor Qandeel has wept off all her cajole [kohl],\u201d the voiceover to the clip would later remark.</p> <p><em>Liars.</em></p> <p><em>All frauds.</em></p> <p>Watch it again.

      "bodyText": "It takes a little over two hours to drive from Multan, a city in southern Punjab, Pakistan, to the village of Shah Sadar Din, and the first time the journalist Sanam Maher made the journey, her eyes widened at every turn. In Dera Ghazi Khan, a town close to the village, none of the faces of the women she saw on the streets were visible. Some wore what looked like black ski masks with slits for their eyes. Others were covered by burqas with no eye-slits at all and so extensive that she felt half naked under her own dupatta (scarf). A thin funnel rises from the top of this kind of burqa: a device to allow air inside so that the wearer does not suffocate. Her contact in the town, noticing her staring, mentioned a place not far away, where the tribal belt of Balochistan province starts: the women there, he told her, were not given shoes. She was confused. Why not? \u201cYou\u2019ll never look at any man if you\u2019re scared of where your naked foot might fall when you leave your home,\u201d he replied impatiently, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. Maher, who is based in Karachi, was in Shah Sadar Din to investigate the life and death of Fouzia Azeem, AKA Qandeel Baloch, Pakistan\u2019s first social media celebrity and the woman some like to describe as its Kim Kardashian. Baloch was born here, the daughter of a poor family, and when she was murdered on 15 July, 2016, her body was supposed to end up in the village\u2019s brown river, a spot well known for being the final resting place of women who have died at the hands of their relatives in so-called \u201chonour\u201d killings. On the day in question, however, there were too many people around to manage this (another villager had died; crowds of mourners were gathering). Baloch\u2019s mother found the body at home; her father informed the authorities. When the police arrived, Baloch was still lying where she had been drugged and asphyxiated, in a bedroom at the small house that she rented for her parents in Multan. She was just 26. \u201cVisiting Shah Sadar Din was a huge culture shock for me,\u201d says Maher, whose book about the case, A Woman Like Her, is published in the UK next month (it has already caused something of a sensation in south Asia). \u201cThe women were so completely covered: I\u2019d never seen that anywhere that I\u2019d lived or worked. But it\u2019s important to say straight off that, though this is typical of south Punjab, it has nothing at all to do with religion. These [dress codes] are cultural diktats, just as honour killing and other forms of violence against women are cultural diktats. This is men wanting to control how the women around them live.\u201d Maher had become interested in writing about Baloch because she felt that her life was a good, if rather extreme, example of the tensions that currently exist for the young in Pakistan; of the difference between where they find themselves in society, and where they would like to be. As she puts it: \u201cMy generation is connected to the world in ways that previous generations never were, and because of that we aspire to live and to behave and dress in certain ways. Yet we\u2019re also rooted in a physical space that doesn\u2019t necessarily allow for those aspirations.\u201d But now, in Shah Sadar Din, she saw something else. \u201cI was amazed by Baloch\u2019s gumption. When I went to her village, it struck me almost for the first time just how big a deal it was for a woman to get out of that situation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to put her on a pedestal in my book; I want people to make up their own minds about her. But I remain amazed by her, and it is very cool to be getting messages from readers across Asia telling me that, though they\u2019d begun by wondering why I wanted to write about someone they saw as trashy, they now have real compassion for her.\u201d Qandeel Baloch first came to public attention in 2013, when she auditioned for the reality singing show, Pakistan Idol. Though she wasn\u2019t chosen by the judges, who mocked her high-pitched voice, her performance \u2013 and the tears she supposedly shed on being eliminated \u2013 soon went viral. Thanks to this, she began to pick up occasional media work: modelling jobs, appearances on chat shows, gigs plugging products on her Facebook page. But how to sustain people\u2019s interest? As a young woman with few contacts, no money and not much obvious talent, her only option was to exploit social media, something at which she turned out to be highly adept. In 2015, for instance, a scrappy but rather pert 20-second video she made of herself known as How I\u2019m Looking? resulted in her inclusion in Google\u2019s list of the top 10 most searched for Pakistanis online. There are more than 44 million users of social media in Pakistan, but the addicts among them are (this is the same the world over) easily bored. People scroll and scroll, and then move on. Baloch had no choice but to repeatedly up the ante if she wanted her followers to keep talking about her, and if this meant pushing against the boundaries of what was acceptable in Pakistan, it was a risk she was willing to take; opprobrium, after all, was just another form of fame. In October 2015, when Imran Khan, the former cricketer who is now Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, announced the end of his second marriage, Baloch launched an online campaign to become wife number three (every TV channel screened her \u201cpress conference\u201d). The following February, she released a message in which she denounced those conservatives in Pakistan who regarded the celebration of Valentine\u2019s Day as un-Islamic. In March, she offered to perform a striptease for Shahid Afridi, the captain of the Pakistani national cricket team, if the side beat India in the World Twenty20 Cup. Finally, in April, she appeared on a comedy news show with a 50-year-old mullah, Mufti Abdul Qavi. The cleric, something of a media star himself, did not rise to the bait offered by the show\u2019s presenter, who asked him what he thought of her offer to Afridi (he also wondered aloud if striptease might not be a useful weapon in the national effort to deradicalise Islamic militants). But Qavi did say that he would like to meet Baloch again the next time he was in Karachi, where she was living by then. It isn\u2019t clear, now, which of them made sure his seemingly throwaway request became a reality, but what we do know is that in June, Baloch released images of a meeting with the cleric that had taken place in a hotel room. In one, she poses in Qavi\u2019s distinctive cap, her mouth open in a wide \u2018O\u2019 that suggests a certain disrespectful naughtiness on both their parts. In a short video, meanwhile, Qavi can be heard announcing that he intends, in the future, to offer her religious guidance. In this moment, the die was cast for Baloch, for all that she would later insist that Qavi had behaved inappropriately towards her, and that he was \u201ca blot\u201d on the name of Islam. The encounter triggered a media storm, the main consequence of which was that the press was now determined to find out more about her. Things she had long kept hidden \u2013 not only her real name, and her humble background, but also the fact that she had run away from an arranged marriage to her cousin, seeking sanctuary in a refuge, and was now divorced and forbidden to see her son, Mishal \u2013 were soon revealed to a transfixed public. \u201cHere was a woman who managed to fool everyone,\u201d says Maher. \u201cShe had created a persona that we all completely bought into.\u201d Meanwhile, back in her village, people began to torment the youngest of her six brothers, Waseem. They would come into the mobile phone shop that he owned and ask him, sniggering, if he could download his sister\u2019s latest videos for them. In the public confession he made before the press following his arrest the day after his sister\u2019s body was found, he gave as his motive \u201cthe way she was coming on Facebook\u201d. A reporter wanted to know: was he ashamed? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, sticking out his chin. \u201cI have no shame.\u201d In her book, Maher traces Baloch\u2019s journey from Shah Sadar Din to unlikely celebrity, uncovering new details of how she pulled off her transformation (for a time, for instance, she worked as a hostess for a Multan bus company, welcoming passengers on board and serving them cardboard containers of biryani). She talks to her parents, Muhammad and Anwar, who initially condemned their son, even calling for him to receive the death penalty, as well as to many others of those who knew her (in all, Maher did 125 interviews while she was researching the story). But she also looks at the wider effects of social media on Pakistani women. Increasingly, men are using it to shame women, and even to blackmail them, by threatening to release images, doctored or otherwise, online if they do not behave as they should. In this sense, the internet is for them just another control mechanism. One story told by Maher sticks in the mind: that of Naila, a 22-year-old university student who killed herself in 2016. No one is certain, but it seems likely that she had discovered that a man she had been involved with had nude pictures of her. \u201cWhat shocks about Naila,\u201d says Maher, \u201cis that those who were supposedly there to protect her \u2013 her teachers \u2013 were saying things like: if young women want to be safe online, they shouldn\u2019t send anything to anyone that they wouldn\u2019t show their father or brother. Their attitude was: you\u2019re asking for it. But let\u2019s say that you\u2019re in a relationship. You take a slightly suggestive picture, and send it to your boyfriend. Then the relationship fizzles out, and he threatens to send the picture to your family. Who do you go to? No one is sympathetic.\u201d Many women in the UK feel unsafe online. But as Maher points out, the stakes are vastly higher in Pakistan. \u201cIt can very quickly spiral from someone disliking an opinion you have to real violence. It\u2019s really not just a case of words on a screen. This is an exciting time for us. Groups that were previously marginalised \u2013 queer groups, religious minorities \u2013 have found a space online. It is a moment of real freedom. But it comes with real danger. We\u2019re starting to be smarter about online safety, but then, so are the people who don\u2019t like our opinions.\u201d By the time Baloch was murdered, there had already been an estimated 326 so-called \u201chonour\u201d killings in Pakistan in 2016, of which 312 victims were women. Six days after her death, a parliamentary committee approved a bill that closed a legal loophole that had allowed relatives of the deceased to pardon perpetrators, or to receive \u201cblood money\u201d as compensation for the crime, enabling the killers to walk free. Since the change in the law, those found guilty will face a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment; relatives of the deceased can only now prevent the killer from receiving a death sentence. Yet still the killings continue. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan estimates that at least 524 such murders occurred between October 2016, when the amendment came into effect, and October 2017. \u201cIf things are really to change, we need a systemic shift in the education system,\u201d says Maher. \u201cChildren need to be taught that this is not a religious thing, and that it can\u2019t be excused on those grounds \u2013 and parents need to teach their sons that they have no more rights than their sisters.\u201d Waseem Azeem remains in prison, but he has not been convicted of Baloch\u2019s murder: \u201cThese cases can get dragged out for years. All we do know is that he can\u2019t get off scot free.\u201d Will his parents save him from the death penalty if a judge decides to impose it? Who knows. But as Maher points out, they now rely entirely on their sons financially \u2013 something that may, in the future, play a part in whatever they decide. For Maher, working on this story wasn\u2019t easy: \u201cAt one point, I said to my editor: every woman in this book is either dead or receiving death threats. It really started to weigh on me.\u201d In Pakistan, many of the bigger book stores have been reluctant to stock A Woman Like Her; others keep it under the counter, as if, she says, \u201cI\u2019d written porn, or something\u201d. But she also understands that she has privileges that her subject could only have dreamed of. \u201cI think about this often,\u201d she says. \u201cI have opportunities that Qandeel didn\u2019t. I have been able to talk to men who thought she deserved to die, and yet I was safe because of my role as a reporter. I got to leave, and go back to my own home. Sometimes, I struggle with this. No one ever asked her to write an op-ed in the New York Times, but [in death] she is getting me all this attention.\u201d What does she think Baloch\u2019s legacy, if any, will be? Is it possible that the murder of this funny, smart yet rather naive young woman \u2013 one who began to talk, towards the end of her life, openly about feminism \u2013 will prove to be some kind of turning point in Pakistan? \u201cWell, we\u2019re not done with her yet,\u201d she says. \u201cThis happened in 2016, and three years on, we\u2019re still talking about her. Women here take great courage from what she said and how she behaved. We tend to have these moments in Pakistan. They\u2019re often, as was the case with Malala [Yousafzai, the Nobel laureate, who was shot on a school bus in Pakistan in 2012], brought on by great violence. They\u2019re a moment of reckoning, when we hit pause and ask where we are going? It happened with Qandeel, too. When I see the pictures of women\u2019s marches here, her face is always in the crowd: people wear masks of it. Her legacy is to encourage young men and women to think that if she could speak out, we should all at least try to do the same ourselves.\u201d Extract: A Woman Like Her by Sanam Maher Fouzia Azeem, otherwise known as Qandeel Baloch, first came to the attention of the public three years before her murder, when she auditioned for Pakistan Idol, the reality singing show, in 2013. Qandeel snaps her fingers and dances and sits on the hood of a car, bouncing her head to the music playing from her mobile phone. \u201cI\u2019m a professional model. I do modelling, shoots, brand shoots,\u201d she explains in a video recorded earlier at what appears to be her home. Her cheeks have been rouged and her eyebrows are swiped with too much dark powder. Her hair, parted down the middle, is pinned on each side with a schoolgirl\u2019s barrettes. \u201cI love singing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a hobby, but a passion. I feel I can be Pakistan\u2019s idol.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? asks the actor judge when Qandeel walks into the room for her audition. \u201cPinky?\u201d \u201cQandeel Baloch.\u201d \u201cOkay, I thought maybe it\u2019s Pinky.\u201d The judge points to her outfit. \u201cEverything is pink.\u201d \u201cYou look so beautiful,\u201d Qandeel gushes. \u201cI always see you on TV, but mashallah, you look so beautiful.\u201d \u201cFeel free to praise him too, or he\u2019ll get offended,\u201d the actor says, gesturing towards the male judge. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no point praising men; it makes no difference to them,\u201d Qandeel replies. Qandeel says she is nervous. She puts on a little girl\u2019s whining voice, and the judges cajole her to give it her best shot. But when she finally does sing, she is a natural. She isn\u2019t rooted to that oval plastic mat like other contestants. She walks forward, beckoning to the judges with her arms, beseeching them with her words, closing her eyes as she sways. She stares straight into the camera. She isn\u2019t nervous; she is performing. Later, the producers add some effects to the clip. One judge has smoke billowing out of her ears. When Qandeel hits a high note, there is a sound like a spring recoiling. The male judge buries his face in his hands. When they tell her to leave, she strokes the hair falling from those two schoolgirl barrettes and gives a small smile, saying in that little girl\u2019s voice: \u201cDon\u2019t reject me please.\u201d She pouts. \u201cI want to sing some more.\u201d The actor walks over to her and holds her by the shoulders and leads her out. The male judge pretends to cry. \u201cYou fooled me,\u201d Qandeel wails to the cameras waiting outside. \u201cI told my parents I\u2019m doing this audition and they\u2019re so hopeful now. Now what am I going to say to them? They will just think: \u2018They rejected our daughter.\u2019\u201d She is on the verge of tears, her breath catching on each word. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Cheer up, okay?\u201d the actor says, patting her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you doing modelling some day.\u201d As she walks away, Qandeel covers her face with both her hands and lets out a wail. The show\u2019s host pushes the mic towards her. She turns back to him, doubling over as she sobs. Her shrieks echo in the hall. There is no one else there. The other contestants have gone away and it is now dark outside. The cameras follow her as she cups her face in her hands, the baby-pink painted nails covering her eyes as she cries all the way out of the door. \u201cPoor Qandeel has wept off all her cajole [kohl],\u201d the voiceover to the clip would later remark. Liars. All frauds. Watch it again. Do you see any tears? What I did there was my acting. Everything was planned from the start. It\u2019s all bakwaas [fake]. The audition clip went viral. To date, Qandeel\u2019s five minutes on Pakistan Idol have racked up well over 10m hits on YouTube. \u2022 A Woman Like Her: The Short Life of Qandeel Baloch is published by Bloomsbury on 11 July (\u00a316.99).

Similarly, when Southampton appointed Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl last December, he replaced Mark Hughes, who had been signed up until 2021. Hughes had replaced Mauricio Pellegrino, whose deal will run out next summer. The Welshman\u2019s contract at Stoke City expired at the end of last season \u2013 he was sacked in January 2018. Hughes is by no means alone in failing to see out multiple contracts. In January of last year, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho signed an extension with Manchester United that would have taken him to the end of the 2019-20 season, with an option for a further year. His previous Chelsea contract, signed in August 2015 before he was sacked four months later, expires this summer. Paying off managers is expensive. Manchester United\u2019s half-yearly accounts revealed it had cost \u00a319.6m to pay off Mourinho and his assistants, who had previously received a total of more than \u00a38m from Chelsea. \u201cIt\u2019s become a cost of doing business in the Premier League,\u201d says Ray Wann, an employment lawyer with Sheridans, a specialist sports law company. \u201cIt\u2019s become a manager-friendly situation. You have managers who become used to being sacked and know they will be well remunerated. They will get a heavy pay-off if clubs change their minds.\u201d In the Premier League, multi-year contracts are the norm, while single-year, rolling contracts are more common in the Football League. Even at clubs like Manchester United, managers like Mourinho hold the balance of power in the negotiation of their employment and subsequent termination. Aspirant managers tend to be signed on lesser terms. \u201cThe bigger the name, the better the negotiating power on the notice period,\u201d one agent told The Guardian. \u201cIf you\u2019re early in your management career and getting a job that\u2019s, on the surface, a step up, the club might agree to pay you six or 12 months\u2019 salary. \u201cSometimes the notice period is linked to gardening leave. The club will pay the full amount after a sacking but as soon as the manager is working again, the amount drops or goes completely.\u201d Those spiralling costs have meant that six- and eight-year deals, like those signed by Moyes and Pardew are understandably scarce, although J\u00fcrgen Klopp is three years from completing a six-year deal at Liverpool, pending an extension. The current Premier League managers with the longest time left on their tenures are Watford\u2019s Javi Gracia, Tottenham\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino, and the new Brighton manager, Graham Potter. Each are under contract until the summer of 2023.",

Police were called by London ambulance service at 3.30am on Saturday to reports of a woman in cardiac arrest at a property on Raymead Avenue, Thornton Heath. Officers found Fauvrelle, 26, who was eight months pregnant, with stab injuries. Despite the efforts of paramedics, she died at the scene. Her baby was delivered at the scene before being taken to hospital and remains in a critical condition. A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and was taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody. A 37-year-old male arrested has been released under investigation pending further inquiries. The Metropolitan police said the victim\u2019s next of kin had been informed and a postmortem examination would be held in due course. The Met\u2019s homicide and serious crime command said officers were keeping an open mind on the motive for the stabbing and urged anyone with information to contact police.

Citing the US and the UK as the worst offenders, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in its annual health check of the global financial system that a dramatic rise in borrowing in recent years by businesses with low credit scores meant the market for corporate debt was becoming increasingly unstable. While it was not clear whether or how a crisis might unfold, the $3tn (\u00a32.4tn) market for low-grade corporate debt was already \u201coverheating\u201d and risked provoking a panic that could send market values crashing as happened 11 years ago. The Basel-based watchdog said a surge in the sale of collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), which are collections of low-grade corporate debts packaged for sale to investors, was reminiscent of the steep rise in their forerunner \u2013 collateralised debt obligations \u2013 which \u201camplified the sub-prime crisis\u201d. Echoing warnings earlier this year from the OECD, Agust\u00edn Carstens, the BIS\u2019s general manager, said he was especially concerned at the way corporations had used complex debt products that lie outside the view of financial regulators to extend the level of lending. \u201cPerhaps the most visible symptom of potential overheating is the remarkable growth of the leveraged loan market, which has reached some $3tn,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile firms in the US \u2013 and, to a lesser extent, the UK \u2013 have accounted for the bulk of the issuance, holdings are spread out more widely. There is most concern about corporate debt, more than the household or sovereign sectors.\u201d He added that regulators needed to stay vigilant to limit the potential impact from a slowdown in economic growth. Carstens is a former head of Mexico\u2019s central bank and last month ruled himself out of the running for the top job at the Bank of England when Mark Carney leaves in January, saying he preferred to stay at the BIS. He said the demands of investors for higher returns had pushed finance companies increasingly to lend money to firms with poor credit scores. \u201cFor quite some time, credit standards have been deteriorating, supported by buoyant demand as investors have searched for yield,\u201d he said. The BIS also called on governments to respond to the slowing global economy by boosting investment spending and pushing through business and tax reforms to ease pressure on central banks. The US Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates at its meeting later in July in response to a slowing US economy while the European Central Bank has signalled that it will cut borrowing costs across the 19-member eurozone as long as inflation remains around 1%. Carstens said short-term pressures from falling economic growth was married to longer-term structural shifts in the labour market to keep interest rates low. He said wage increases across the developed world are unlikely to be high enough to spark an increase in inflation, leaving central banks to keep monetary policy low for several more years. \u201cEven though we have seen higher wages recently, they have not translated into higher prices.

I think it\u2019s Rattigan\u2019s profoundest exploration of one of his favourite themes: the inequality of passion. After all, it shows a woman, Hester Collyer, driven to suicidal desperation by the inability of her lover, Freddie Page, to fulfil her emotional and sexual needs.

I\u2019d expected something a bit tight-lipped and restrained, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/brief-encounter-romance\">Brief Encounter</a>. But Hester and Freddie really go at it hammer and tongs. Freddie, who has had a good war but can\u2019t adjust to the postwar world, reminded me of the heroine of David Hare\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/14/plenty-review-chichester-festival-theatre-david-hare\">Plenty</a>, and Hester even prefigures John Osborne\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/30/how-look-back-in-anger-john-osborne\">Jimmy Porter</a> in her need for a partner who can match her fire.</p> <p><strong>OH:</strong> All true. But this is also a play about a very English kind of male inhibition \u2013 which is perfectly exemplified by Hester\u2019s high court judge husband, Sir William, who pleads with her to return. His tragedy is that he is a victim of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/class-issues\">class</a> in the way he equates love with social convention, but Gerald Kyd is encouraged to play him with such table-thumping ferocity that you\u2019re almost surprised Hester doesn\u2019t go back to him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ccef3a0d2ca7673eee1a38019a8f19218184f1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ccef3a0d2ca7673eee1a38019a8f19218184f1e/0_0_5754_3836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerald Kyd plays Hester\u2019s husband Sir William.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Class tragedy \u2026 Gerald Kyd plays Hester\u2019s husband Sir William.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>YT:</strong> You\u2019re dead wrong. The production\u2019s whole point is that all these characters have a hidden fury. That\u2019s true of Hadley Fraser\u2019s Freddie, who is not just some cheery ex-RAF chappie but a man whose sense of failure drives him to drink and who is the play\u2019s real victim, in that he goes off to almost certain death.</p> <p><strong>OH:</strong> Fair enough. But did the actors have to shout so much? Perhaps we can agree about Nancy Carroll\u2019s Hester. At times, she looked at Freddie with the tender gaze of the hopelessly smitten: at other times, as when she swept a bottle of whisky off the table, she seemed to pulsate with rage. I liked her best, however, when she was at her quietest, as in the scenes with the struck-off doctor \u2013 beautifully played by Matthew Cottle \u2013 where she perfectly caught Hester\u2019s sense of shame and despair.</p> <p><strong>YT:</strong> I thought she was magnificent all through. She conveyed Hester\u2019s hysteria but there were also subtle touches such as the way she carefully packed in Freddie\u2019s luggage the two things that mattered most to him: a mounted cricket ball and a copy of Wisden!</p> <p><strong>OH:</strong> That was good. But I still feel in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/mar/25/whyterencerattiganistheen\">Rattigan</a> there is a tension between the power of the emotion and the means of expression, which I only truly felt in the desolate final moments.</p> <p><strong>YT:</strong> That\u2019s a cliched vision of how Rattigan should be played. I loved this production because it was about two incompatible souls trapped in an impossible situation. I\u2019d unhesitatingly give it five stars.</p> <p><strong>OH:</strong> I\u2019d give it three.</p> <p><strong>YT:</strong> Shall we agree to split the difference? </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/the-deep-blue-sea\">At the Minerva, Chichester, until 27 July</a>. </p>",

But this is also a play about a very English kind of male inhibition \u2013 which is perfectly exemplified by Hester\u2019s high court judge husband, Sir William, who pleads with her to return. His tragedy is that he is a victim of his class in the way he equates love with social convention, but Gerald Kyd is encouraged to play him with such table-thumping ferocity that you\u2019re almost surprised Hester doesn\u2019t go back to him. YT: You\u2019re dead wrong. The production\u2019s whole point is that all these characters have a hidden fury. That\u2019s true of Hadley Fraser\u2019s Freddie, who is not just some cheery ex-RAF chappie but a man whose sense of failure drives him to drink and who is the play\u2019s real victim, in that he goes off to almost certain death. OH: Fair enough. But did the actors have to shout so much? Perhaps we can agree about Nancy Carroll\u2019s Hester. At times, she looked at Freddie with the tender gaze of the hopelessly smitten: at other times, as when she swept a bottle of whisky off the table, she seemed to pulsate with rage. I liked her best, however, when she was at her quietest, as in the scenes with the struck-off doctor \u2013 beautifully played by Matthew Cottle \u2013 where she perfectly caught Hester\u2019s sense of shame and despair. YT: I thought she was magnificent all through. She conveyed Hester\u2019s hysteria but there were also subtle touches such as the way she carefully packed in Freddie\u2019s luggage the two things that mattered most to him: a mounted cricket ball and a copy of Wisden! OH: That was good. But I still feel in Rattigan there is a tension between the power of the emotion and the means of expression, which I only truly felt in the desolate final moments. YT: That\u2019s a cliched vision of how Rattigan should be played. I loved this production because it was about two incompatible souls trapped in an impossible situation. I\u2019d unhesitatingly give it five stars. OH: I\u2019d give it three. YT: Shall we agree to split the difference? \u2022 At the Minerva, Chichester, until 27 July.",

      "body": "<p>In the cosy world of gardening, it\u2019s rare something comes along that changes everything. But for lovers of water plants, in the summer of 2007 a Thai farmer would overturn almost 100 years of entrenched dogma with a creation that many thought impossible: a hardy blue waterlily. </p> <p>With their flawless translucent petals, waterlilies are among the most beautiful of all garden plants. Yet their quirky genetics mean that, unlike most garden favourites, this genus eluded the endeavours of plant breeders until just over a century ago. Right up to the late 1800s the only waterlily available to European gardeners was the white native form. Then a French horticultural genius called Joseph Bory Latour-Marliac cracked a hybridising technique whose results dramatically expanded the options available by mixing in the genes of waterlily species from North America. Pinks, yellows, oranges and reds were the result. It was his waterlilies that inspired Monet, resulting in an explosion in the plant\u2019s popularity.</p> <p>However, Latour-Marliac\u2019s lifelong dream of breeding tropical waterlily species into hardy forms remained an elusive goal. As he famously took his breeding secrets with him to his death in 1911, his vision remained confined to a historical footnote. Over the course of the next century it was conventionally thought that a difference in chromosome number meant that crossing tropical and hardy waterlilies was a genetic impossibility.</p> <p>So when, in 2007, Pairat Songpanich reported he had produced a perfect lavender bloom on frost-hardy plants, it was greeted by many with sheer disbelief. Genetic tests, however, confirmed \u2018Siam Blue Hardy\u2019 to be the first ever proven intersubgeneric (ISG) hybrid. This first cross unleashed all manner of wonderful genetic combinations, making Thailand the world centre of waterlily breeding. Tragically, however, just four years later, a huge flood hit the region. When the waters retreated, all the \u2018Siam Blue Hardy\u2019 plants had been lost.</p> <p>Fortunately, for gardeners in cooler latitudes, many other hardy ISG hybrids did survive and these are now becoming increasingly available in the trade. From \u2018Siam Purple 1\u2019 (another one of Pairat Songpanich\u2019s early creations), whose white petals are blushed with purple at the tips, contrasting beautifully with its sulphur yellow centres, to the semi-double, deep lilac-blushed \u2018Queen Sirikit\u2019, this new generation of Thai cultivars is changing everything. Capturing the imaginations of collectors, some of the brand new varieties can sell for eye-watering prices. However, the costs are falling rapidly, which means soon anyone should be able to enjoy these wonders.</p> <p>Either way, growing one of these miracles of human ingenuity is less than the price of going to see a football match and to me, as a geeky gardener, there is no doubt in my mind which would bring me more joy. </p> <p><em>To buy ISG hybrids, go to <a href=\"http://latour-marliac.com/en/\" title=\"\">Latour-Marliac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nelumbogarden.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nelumbo Garden</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lilieswatergardens.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lilies Water Gardens</a></em></p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the cosy world of gardening, it\u2019s rare something comes along that changes everything. But for lovers of water plants, in the summer of 2007 a Thai farmer would overturn almost 100 years of entrenched dogma with a creation that many thought impossible: a hardy blue waterlily. With their flawless translucent petals, waterlilies are among the most beautiful of all garden plants. Yet their quirky genetics mean that, unlike most garden favourites, this genus eluded the endeavours of plant breeders until just over a century ago. Right up to the late 1800s the only waterlily available to European gardeners was the white native form. Then a French horticultural genius called Joseph Bory Latour-Marliac cracked a hybridising technique whose results dramatically expanded the options available by mixing in the genes of waterlily species from North America. Pinks, yellows, oranges and reds were the result. It was his waterlilies that inspired Monet, resulting in an explosion in the plant\u2019s popularity. However, Latour-Marliac\u2019s lifelong dream of breeding tropical waterlily species into hardy forms remained an elusive goal. As he famously took his breeding secrets with him to his death in 1911, his vision remained confined to a historical footnote. Over the course of the next century it was conventionally thought that a difference in chromosome number meant that crossing tropical and hardy waterlilies was a genetic impossibility. So when, in 2007, Pairat Songpanich reported he had produced a perfect lavender bloom on frost-hardy plants, it was greeted by many with sheer disbelief. Genetic tests, however, confirmed \u2018Siam Blue Hardy\u2019 to be the first ever proven intersubgeneric (ISG) hybrid. This first cross unleashed all manner of wonderful genetic combinations, making Thailand the world centre of waterlily breeding. Tragically, however, just four years later, a huge flood hit the region. When the waters retreated, all the \u2018Siam Blue Hardy\u2019 plants had been lost. Fortunately, for gardeners in cooler latitudes, many other hardy ISG hybrids did survive and these are now becoming increasingly available in the trade. From \u2018Siam Purple 1\u2019 (another one of Pairat Songpanich\u2019s early creations), whose white petals are blushed with purple at the tips, contrasting beautifully with its sulphur yellow centres, to the semi-double, deep lilac-blushed \u2018Queen Sirikit\u2019, this new generation of Thai cultivars is changing everything. Capturing the imaginations of collectors, some of the brand new varieties can sell for eye-watering prices. However, the costs are falling rapidly, which means soon anyone should be able to enjoy these wonders. Either way, growing one of these miracles of human ingenuity is less than the price of going to see a football match and to me, as a geeky gardener, there is no doubt in my mind which would bring me more joy.

If you crave the utterly and amiably natural, this is paradise.</p> <p>Not at first.

      "bodyText": "Let me take you down my home river, the Ticino. The Italian Ticino, that is, just 30 minutes from Milan by car or train (most of the towns mentioned here are on train lines from Milan). It\u2019s a supremely protean creature, rising in the Swiss Alps, plunging and rushing its rocky way (much-loved by kayakers) down to Lake Maggiore, where it sneaks into Italy under cover of the lake to reappear in altogether more placid form at the picturesque town of Sesto Calende. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to start our trip. Ahead of us are about 60 glorious miles south to Pavia, where the Ticino surrenders its glacial waters to the more majestic Po, Venice-bound. So why all the enthusiasm? For about 30 miles, despite its proximity to half a dozen ancient towns, this river has been left absolutely to its own meandering devices. Declared a parco naturale in 1974, it wanders here and there, shifting its course every season, over white shale banks through woods of elm and willow, tangles of honeysuckle and hawthorn, nettles and bulrushes, blackberries and wild strawberries. If you crave the utterly and amiably natural, this is paradise. Not at first. Walking south from Sesto Calende, the river is no more than ordinarily adorable, a wide expanse of transparent water between wooded slopes, neatly embanked to allow picturesque villas to prick your envy and waterside restaurants to offer generous fry-ups of pesciolini e rane, little fish and frogs.

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson was asked how a government of his could spend the promised \u00a34.6bn a year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/03/boris-johnson-pledges-to-raise-secondary-school-spending\">extra on schools</a>, boost transport in the north, roll out UK-wide ultra-fast broadband, have 20,000 extra police, and cut taxes.</p> \n<p>Arguing that some of his tax cuts would create extra revenue and stimulate growth, Johnson said: \u201cWhat is certainly true is at the moment there is cash available. There\u2019s headroom of about \u00a322bn to \u00a325bn at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if he would increase borrowing, he said: \u201cIf it\u2019s borrowing to finance great infrastructure projects, and there\u2019s the opportunity to borrow at low rates, to do things for the long-term benefit of the country, then we should do them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson added: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to borrow to finance certain great objectives, but overall we will keep fiscal responsibility, and keep going with the general trajectory of ensuring that this country pays its way and lives within its means. But you can do that with some sensible tax cuts that will stimulate growth, stimulate enterprise, get more enterprise in.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson said he would want to increase the national living wage \u2013 the new official name for the minimum wage \u2013 but declined to say by how much: \u201cI certainly believe in lifting the living wage, but I\u2019m not going to set a figure now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked by Ridge how much the living wage currently was \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/01/pay-rise-nearly-two-million-national-living-wage-legal\">it is \u00a38.21 an hour</a> \u2013 Johnson said \u201caround \u00a310 or so\u201d. He explained that he had instead meant the London living wage, currently \u00a310.55 an hour, which is a higher, non-compulsory figure intended to reflect real living costs.</p> \n<p>On Brexit, Johnson dismissed the repeated comments by EU figures that his stated plan to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement could not happen, saying this view would rapidly change once he became prime minister.</p> \n<p>\u201cPossibly it\u2019s the case that they would say that at this particular stage in the negotiations. You would expect them to say that kind of thing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to want a disorderly Brexit of any kind. It\u2019s not in their interest. There\u2019s no reason why they should want the sudden imposition of tariffs and quotas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson repeatedly refused, again, to accept personal responsibility for comments he made about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian women jailed in Tehran, and whether they, as her family believe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/30/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-richard-ratcliffe-boris-johnson-gaffes\">had worsened her plight</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course I feel very bad about all the consular cases in Iran, particularly Nazanin,\u201d he said, insisting that Iran was solely responsible and it was wrong to \u201callow whatever I may have said or done to cloud the issue\u201d.</p> \n<p>He similarly dismissed criticism of his comments from the past about black and gay people, and Muslim women who wear full-face veils.</p> \n<p>Asked by Ridge whether he would \u201cjust say anything to get a laugh\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cNo. I think if you look at each and every one of those columns or articles you\u2019ll find that the quotations have been wrenched out of context, in many cases made to mean the opposite of what was intended.\u201d</p> \n<p>Quizzed on whether he took responsibility for anything, Johnson said he would so for Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cI played a part in that campaign and I\u2019m very proud of what we did but I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drift and the dither, and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I want to add now is my own ability, I think, to lead us out of this mess, to get Brexit done by 31 October, and then to do for the whole country what we did in London which is to bring it together.\u201d</p>",

There\u2019s headroom of about \u00a322bn to \u00a325bn at the moment.\u201d Asked if he would increase borrowing, he said: \u201cIf it\u2019s borrowing to finance great infrastructure projects, and there\u2019s the opportunity to borrow at low rates, to do things for the long-term benefit of the country, then we should do them.\u201d Johnson added: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to borrow to finance certain great objectives, but overall we will keep fiscal responsibility, and keep going with the general trajectory of ensuring that this country pays its way and lives within its means. But you can do that with some sensible tax cuts that will stimulate growth, stimulate enterprise, get more enterprise in.\u201d Johnson said he would want to increase the national living wage \u2013 the new official name for the minimum wage \u2013 but declined to say by how much: \u201cI certainly believe in lifting the living wage, but I\u2019m not going to set a figure now.\u201d Asked by Ridge how much the living wage currently was \u2013 it is \u00a38.21 an hour \u2013 Johnson said \u201caround \u00a310 or so\u201d. He explained that he had instead meant the London living wage, currently \u00a310.55 an hour, which is a higher, non-compulsory figure intended to reflect real living costs. On Brexit, Johnson dismissed the repeated comments by EU figures that his stated plan to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement could not happen, saying this view would rapidly change once he became prime minister. \u201cPossibly it\u2019s the case that they would say that at this particular stage in the negotiations. You would expect them to say that kind of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to want a disorderly Brexit of any kind. It\u2019s not in their interest. There\u2019s no reason why they should want the sudden imposition of tariffs and quotas.\u201d Johnson repeatedly refused, again, to accept personal responsibility for comments he made about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian women jailed in Tehran, and whether they, as her family believe, had worsened her plight. \u201cOf course I feel very bad about all the consular cases in Iran, particularly Nazanin,\u201d he said, insisting that Iran was solely responsible and it was wrong to \u201callow whatever I may have said or done to cloud the issue\u201d. He similarly dismissed criticism of his comments from the past about black and gay people, and Muslim women who wear full-face veils. Asked by Ridge whether he would \u201cjust say anything to get a laugh\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cNo. I think if you look at each and every one of those columns or articles you\u2019ll find that the quotations have been wrenched out of context, in many cases made to mean the opposite of what was intended.\u201d Quizzed on whether he took responsibility for anything, Johnson said he would so for Brexit. \u201cI played a part in that campaign and I\u2019m very proud of what we did but I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drift and the dither, and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I want to add now is my own ability, I think, to lead us out of this mess, to get Brexit done by 31 October, and then to do for the whole country what we did in London which is to bring it together.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for today. Read the full story on Trump and Kim\u2019s meeting here: Thanks for following along. Donald Trump has invited Kim Jong-un to visit the US during talks at Korean peninsula\u2019s demilitarised zone after he became the first American president to step onto North Korean soil. The meeting was organised yesterday, both leaders confirmed, after Trump tweeted Kim Jong-un suggesting they meet and \u201csay Hello(?)!\u201d while Trump was in the region for the G20 summit in Osaka. Trump travelled to the DMZ with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, while the three had an hour-long tri-lateral meeting at Peace House. Trump said the meeting was \u201cvery historic\u201d and criticised those who said that nothing had been come about from his two summits with Kim, which occurred last June and earlier this year. Trump announced that new teams would be set up by the three parties to the negotiations. Asked by journalists if he believed that North Korea\u2019s previous negotiators were still alive, he replied: \u201cI think so.\u201d Ivanka Trump had a slightly less glowing take than her father on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea after she and her husband, Jared Kushner, stepped out of one of the blue houses alongside the demarcation line. \u201cHow was North Korea?\u201d she was asked by Margaret Talev from Bloomberg. \u201cSurreal\u201d answered the US president\u2019s daughter. With the dust settling on panmunjom, there\u2019s time now to pick up on some of the other subplots and details, in particular the cast-list of who else was present. According to Anna Fifield, Beijing bureau chief for the Washington Post, those on the sidelines for the handshake included: Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, the US conservative commentator and broadcaster Tucker Carlson, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho and his deputy Choe Song Hui, as well as the North Korean singer and Hyon Song Wol. After announcing that the sides would be setting up new teams to take forward negotiations, Trump was asked during the press conference if he believed that North Korea\u2019s previous negotiators were still alive. \u201cI think they are.. I know one of them is alive,\u201d he replied. Meanwhile, Trump talked up the fact that there has been no recent ballistic missile tests by North Korea. There had been some \u201cvery small ones\u201d - he added, but theres were missile tests which \u201cpractically every country does.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t consider that a test. We are talking about long range missile tests.\u201d Trump says that he invited Kim Jong-un to visit the US \u201cwhen the time is right.\u201d That bit of news - surely the cushions are being plumped up already in Mar-a-Lago - came towards the end of the short press conference he gave alongside the South Korean president. It looks like Trump also indicated that he was prepared to take up an invite to go to Pyongyang. Trump said that he had told Kim: \u201cYou know what? At the right time you are going to come over. We are going to to go over there. I would certainly extend the invite. Trump also said that it was he would suggested that he walk across the DMZ into North Korea. The US president asked Kim if he would like him to cross over and the reply was that he would be honoured. Moon maintained a poker face as Trump segued into a criticism of the previous White House administration \u201cIt was a fiery mess. Bad things were going on,\u201d added the president. After Moon spoke, Trump said that he wanted to thank Kim for saving him the media going after him if the North Korean leader had not taken up the Trump administration: \u201cHad he decided not to come you would have hit me, hit me hard. \u201cI want to thank him for doing it at such quick notice. We moved mountains.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime there has been no nuclear tests, there has been no nuclear missiles\u201d Trump addes that he\u2019s going to go off an speak with US troops now at a nearby military base. Trump is speaking to the press now alongside Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea. It\u2019s a mixture of his usual shots at the media for supposedly not reporting things accurately, and salvos at the Obama administration. If there\u2019s a hint at anything significant, it\u2019s that he says the three parties to the meeting have agreed that teams will be set up now - the US will have one under the auspices of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo - \u201cto start working to see if they can do something.\u201d Trump began by saying \u201cNobody know show things turn out but certainly this was very legendary, a very historic day.\u201d \u201cIt will be even more historic if something comes up.\u201d The three leaders - Trump and the leaders of North and South Korea - have now emerged after more than an hour in talks. Here\u2019s a bit of snatched audio from that rather crowded encounter outside between Trump and Kim earlier, with a suggestion that the North Korean leader has invited his US counterpart to come and visit in the DPRK\u2019s capital Some more snippets from that bilateral meeting at the Freedom House between Trump and Kim, via the latest take from the White House press pool. Journalists were ushered into a \u201cchaotic bilat\u201d at the Freedom House, here Kim Jong Un and POTUS sat in front of the room, reports Seung Min Kim of the Washington Post Speaking through an interpreter, Kim talked of \u201cwilling to put an end to the unfortunate past.\u201d If not for the \u201cexcellent relations between the two of us\u201d this opportunity would not be possible, he added. Trump told the room: \u201cYou hear the power of that voice\u201d referring to Kim. Noted \u201che doesn\u2019t do news conferences.\u201d \u201cThus is a historic moment, the fact that we\u2019re meeting.\u201d He went on: \u201cYou made us both look good\u201d with this meeting. We\u2019ve developed a great relationship.\u201d The two leaders then shook hands and the press were ushered out. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog from Kate. Donald Trump has met with Kim Jong-un in the demilitarised zone and has become the first US president to step onto North Korean soil, after Kim invited Trump to step over the demarcation line into North Korean territory. The meeting was organised yesterday, both leaders confirmed, after Trump tweeted Kim Jong-un suggesting they meet and \u201csay Hello(?)!\u201d while Trump was in the region for the G20 summit in Osaka. Trump travelled to the DMZ with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, the three were expected to have a tri-lateral meeting at Peace House, but Trump and Kim appeared at a press conference without Moon, raising questions about how involved the South Korean leader would be in any discussions. Trump said the meeting was \u201cvery historic\u201d and criticised those who said that nothing had been come about from his two summits with Kim, which occurred last June and earlier this year. Trump said he would be willing to invite Kim to the White House \u201cright now\u201d Devastating analysis from Victor Cha, a professor at Georgetown University, who calls this \u201creality TV\u201d and \u201cfaked diplomacy\u201d that gives US, South Korea and North Korea \u201ctrivial domestic kudos while legitimizing the [human rights] abusing/nuke regime\u201d. There was a lot of jostling in the press pack as they attempted to cover the meeting. A female voice could be heard repeatedly saying \u201cPlease stop it, don\u2019t do that.\u201d Though it is unclear who that was, as she wasn\u2019t in shot, and if that event is connected to the alleged Grisham event reported by Jim Acosta from CNN. As well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson was present in the White House pool. A reminder of that social media invitation from Trump : We have this pool report from a reporter on the ground with the president. At 3:44pm, POTUS walked out of Freedom House, together with President Moon, towards the military demarcation line between South and North Korea, located between the two famous blue huts. The North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, wearing his traditional Mao suit, was walking down the stairs towards him on the Northern side of the line. At 3:45pm, the two leaders shook hands over the concrete slab that forms the military demarcation line between South and North Korea. \u201cGood to see you again\u201d, said Kim in English, adding that he would have \u201cnever expected\u201d to see POTUS \u201cat this place\u201d. At 3:46pm, POTUS crossed the line, becoming the first sitting US president to step into North Korea. He then walked a few meters into the North together with Kim. \u201cGood progress, good progress\u201d, he said as the two leaders crossed back to the South. The two leaders are now holding a bilateral meeting in The Freedom House on the South Korean side. There is some discussion about the fact that this is supposed to be a tri-lateral meeting between Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in. All three leaders went into the building together, but only Kim and Trump fronted the cameras for that press conference. It is unclear whether Moon will join them for the rest of the meeting. Trump is speaking now. He comments on the fact that we are hearing from Kim directly. \u201cYou hear that voice, no one hears this voice, he doesn\u2019t do press conferences.\u201d Trump says he wants to thank Kim for responding to his Twitter invitation to meet. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t show up the press was going to make me look very bad,\u201d says Trump. \u201cIf you look back two-and-a-half years, before I was president, it was a very very bad situation, a very dangerous situation for North Korea, South Korea, for the world. The relationship we have developed has been so much for so many people,\u201d says Trump. \u201cThank you for asking me to step over that line, I didn\u2019t know if you were going to ask me to do that, I thought you might, but I was ready to do that if you asked.\u201d Trump calls the meeting \u201cvery historic\u201d. \u201cThe great relationship between President Trump and I, I don\u2019t think if we didn\u2019t have such a great relationship we could have organised this meeting in just a day. I would like to use this strong relationship to create more good news that nobody expects,\u201d says Kim. Kim confirms he heard from Trump yesterday afternoon and wanted to meet him again. \u201cI believe that meeting here, which is a symbol of division and a hostile past, I think meeting here, two countries that have a hostile past, we are showcasing to the world that we have a new present and we have a positive meeting going forward,\u201d says Kim. Trump and Kim are inside now, seated in front of a row of flags. Kim is speaking, will have the translation soon. Standing with Trump on the southern side of the DMZ, Kim said. \u201cPresident Trump just crossed became first US president to visit our country. This is an expression of his willingness to eliminate the aggression of the past and open a new future.\u201d Trump responded: \u201cThis is my honour. I didn\u2019t expect it. Stepping across that line was a great honour \u2013 a lot of progress has been made and this is a great friendship. It was short notice so I want to thank you,\u201d he said, gesturing to Kim. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go and talk for a while. A lot of positive things are happening \u2026 we met and we liked each other from day one. and that\u2019s very important.\u201d And the press conference has actually wrapped up this time and Trump and Kim are heading inside a building for discussions. Trump is still talking. \u201cWhen I became president of the US, there was great great conflict, now there is less conflict,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my great honour and the Chairman\u2019s honour.\u201d \u2018Stepping across that line is a great honour,\u2019 says Trump Trump is speaking now, standing alongside Chairman Kim. \u201cI just want to say this is my honour,\u201d he says. \u201cStepping across that line is a great honour, great progress has been made, great friendships have been made and this has been, in particular, a great friendship.\u201d Trump has thanked Kim for being available to meet at such short notice, saying he called him up yesterday. \u201cWe met and we liked each other from day one, and that is very important.\u201d The press conference has finished up, Trump says he and Kim are going inside to talk for a little while. A reporter asks whether Kim will come to the US any time soon. \u201cI would invite him right now,\u201d Trump says. Donald Trump has crossed the demarcation line onto North Korean soil. This is huge, as Julian Borger writes: \u201cDonald Trump has become the first incumbent US president to cross, even if it turns out to be only a few inches, into North Korea. It has a particular symbolic importance to the Kim regime, and is a sign of the country\u2019s normalisation and status in the world as a power among world powers. Bill Clinton came close to visiting in his last couple of months in office, but decided against it, after it was clear in 2000 that George W Bush had been elected as his successor. Clinton felt he could not lock Bush into a peace process the latter would not support. \u201cJimmy Carter visited Kim\u2019s father Kim Il-sung in 1994 in pursuit of a diplomatic breakthrough, but he went as a former president.\u201d The US president has met with the North Korean leader in a hastily-arranged handshake meeting. Trump confirmed on Sunday that while the visit to the demilitarised zone has been scheduled for several months, he called up Kim yesterday to set up the brief meeting. Trump is in the region for the G20 meeting in Osaka. The meeting is just a greeting between the two leaders, and it is not expected that the two leaders will hold long talks today. Arirang News in South Korea is quoting sources as saying that Trump, Kim and Moon have already met at the DMZ. Though they also say: \u201cWe are also not really sure what is going on right now.\u201d It\u2019s a weird afternoon. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as we have confirmation of that meeting. So we are now just waiting for Donald Trump\u2019s handshake meeting with Kim Jong-un, which Trump said would happen in four minutes (roughly 10 minutes ago). Confirmation that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are in the DMZ with the president. Trump is greeting military personnel. This event is taking place at a base in the DMZ. He is now signing the wall of the base, in keeping with tradition. \u201cYesterday, I had the idea, maybe I\u2019ll call Chairman Kim\u2026We respect each other, might even like each other,\u201d Trump told the gathered military personnel and press. Trump has been presented with a golf shirt and cap with his name on it from a US military leader, in appreciation of his work for peace in the region. Donald Trump says this visit was organised several months ago when he told Moon he would like to visit the DMZ. But says that the meeting with Kim Jong-un was only organised yesterday. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t give him much notice,\u201d he says. He says the meeting with Kim will take place in about four minutes, so he needs to cut his remarks short. President Moon says we will witness an even more momentous event today. He says these great changes, from the DMZ being a place of hostility to peace is due to President Trump, whom he praises as \u201cthe president of all of you\u201d. President Moon Jae-in is speaking now in a meeting with Donald Trump and military personnel. The South Korean president thanks the personnel for keeping Korea safe and says this is a historic meeting, the first time that the US president and South Korean president have ever been in the DMZ together. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior aide, is also in the DMZ and has signalled her willingness to cross into North Korea if invited. Interesting analysis from Frank Jannuzi, formerly of the state department, in response to Trump\u2019s comment that \u201call of the danger went away\u201d after the first summit between the two leaders last June. \u2018After our first summit all of the danger went away,\u2019 Trump addresses press in DMZ \u201cIt used to be dangerous, very, very dangerous. After our first summit all of the danger went away,\u201d Trump said, while addressing press in the DMZ. Trump criticised the press for their coverage of his summits with Kim Jong-un, particularly the most recent summit in Hanoi, which ended suddenly without an agreement. \u201cThey have no appreciation for what we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say to people who say nothing has been accomplished, so much was accomplished,\u201d he said. Trump was told that around 25 million people, including 10 million in the Seoul greater metropolitan area, are within range of North Korean artillery along the northern side of the DMZ. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that anywhere, in terms of danger,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all working out,\u201d he added in a reference to his dialogue with Kim Jong-un. \u201cIt always works out.\u201d While at the observation post, Trump\u2019s military minder pointed out the Kaesong industrial complex, a joint North-South venture where tens of thousands of North Korean workers made products, including clothes and watches, for more than 100 South Korean companies. The complex\u2019s fate has always been closely linked to the health of cross-border ties. It was closed by South Korea\u2019s conservative government in 2016 in protest at North Korean nuclear test and missile launches. Seoul said profits from Kaesong were funding Pyongyang\u2019s military programmes. The current South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, a liberal, would like to reopen Kaesong to encourage the North to make nuclear concessions, but restarting the complex is complicated by international economic sanctions against the regime in Pyongyang. It\u2019s unclear where Trump is going now and when and where he will be meeting with Kim Jong-un. Trump is speaking to press. He says that much has been accomplished in improving the North Korean and US relationship due to his meetings with Kim Jong-un. \u201cI would say to people who say nothing has been accomplished, so much was accomplished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all working out, it always works out.\u201d And Trump has left the observation tower. A reminder that this issue has been a key branding point for Donald Trump who hails his meetings with Kim Jong-un (particularly the first meeting in Singapore last year) as one of the great achievements of his presidency. Footage from that meeting has featured in many of the video packages produced by the president\u2019s team, that resemble movie trailers, selling Trump\u2019s achievements. Looks like we might expect today\u2019s meeting to feature in the next video. Is this meeting significant? At a press conference an hour and a half ago South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in said the meeting represented a \u201cbig hope to everyone\u201d. Speaking alongside Trump at the start of their bilateral talks, Moon said even a handshake and brief encounter between Trump and Kim \u201cwould be a significant milestone in the peace process on the Korean peninsula\u201d. Moon, who has travelled with Trump to the DMZ, added that he could \u201creally feel that the flower of peace was truly blossoming on the Korean peninsula.\u201d He later told a joint press conference that he was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with emotion about the meeting at the border village of Panmunjom. He described Trump and Kim as \u201cso brave\u201d adding, \u201cI hope President Trump will go down in history as the president who achieves peace on Korean peninsula.\u201d This is the third time the two leaders have met. The first was in Singapore last June. They met again in February this year in Hanoi, but the meeting ended abruptly without progress. Associated Press is saying that the meeting between the two leaders is not as impromptu as it has been presented. From AP: \u201cDespite Trump\u2019s comments Saturday, he had told The Hill newspaper in Washington in an interview this past week that he would be visiting the DMZ and \u201cmight\u201d meet with Kim. The paper reported it had withheld Trump\u2019s comments, citing security concerns by the White House.\u201d Trump is flanked by a large number of aides and military personnel and South Korean president Moon Jae-in. He is currently looking out over the DMZ from a bunker and being shown the landscape. Donald Tump has arrived in the DMZ for this fairly impromptu meeting with the chairman of North Korea. They are expected to shake hands and say hello, but not have any full-length talks. The president\u2019s motorcade is pulling up now. The live-stream embedded at the top of the Guardian\u2019s liveblog is making for some interesting listening at the moment. Reporters are preparing to get footage of the president\u2019s arrival and greeting of the North Korean leader. However, they are being given strict instructions about what they are and are not allowed to film and photograph. \u201cThe boundary is the tower, do not film anything past that tower,\u201d a minder\u2019s voice is heard saying in English. This is Kate Lyons taking over from Alison Rourke. CNN reports that Trump has landed in the demilitarised zone and will meet with Kong Jong-un shortly. Donald Trump first suggested the meeting with Kim in a tweet at the G20 meeting in Japan yesterday morning, in which he said he\u2019d like to \u201csay Hello(?)!)\u201c. During meetings in Seoul today he said that a handshake with Kim would \u201cmean a lot\u201d. The meeting between the two leaders was only confirmed in the past hour or so when Trump and South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-in, held a joint press conference. You can read our full story on that here. More images are coming in of Trump\u2019s helicopters arriving at the DMZ. Donald Trump has travelled to the so-called \u201cpeace village\u201d of Panmunjom, the site of the demarcation line between the two Koreas when their war finished in 1953. Helicopters have been arriving at the site in the past two minutes. Hello and welcome to this live blog for the highly anticipated meeting between President Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong-un. The two men are expected to shake hands at the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, possibly in the next hour. There is also the possibility that Donald Trump may step over the border and in to the north, something he said yesterday he would be happy to do. Trump will be accompanied by South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-in. Follow all of our live coverage of this historic meeting.",

      "bodyText": "Labor is considering backing a Senate inquiry into compliance with ministerial standards which is being pursued by the Centre Alliance after controversy over Christopher Pyne\u2019s decision to join a major consultancy firm. Pyne, the former defence minister, announced last week he had taken up a job with EY to help the consulting group expand its defence business. The current federal ministerial standards require that ministers do not lobby, advocate for or have business meetings with government, parliamentarians, or the defence force on \u201cany matters on which they have had official dealings\u201d in the past 18 months. The standards also say that ministers should not use information they have obtained in office for private gain. The guidelines are not enforceable, and transgressions are rarely policed. With parliament set to resume on Tuesday, Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has now called for a Senate inquiry into compliance with the standards. \u201cMr Pyne cannot unknow what he knows from nearly three years\u2019 service at the top of the defence portfolio,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cHis acceptance of his new job with EY is unquestionably a breach of the spirit, and indeed the letter, of the prime minister\u2019s standards. The question is now what is the prime minister going to do about it?\u201d Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong, who was critical of Pyne\u2019s decision to join the firm last week, said the opposition was considering the Patrick proposal for a Senate investigation. \u201cWhen even Mr Pyne\u2019s own party colleagues raise concerns about his actions, as we saw with Senator Abetz \u2026 it is clear Mr Morrison needs to act to enforce his own code of conduct,\u201d Wong said. The Greens have also expressed objection to Pyne\u2019s new role. \u201cThe Greens have long campaigned to shut the revolving door of MPs and lobbyists yet it keeps on spinning,\u201d said Larissa Waters, the party\u2019s democracy spokesperson. \u201cWe want to see a five-year cooling of period for post-politics for-profit work that might raise a conflict of interest, and a lobbying register and code of conduct with teeth.\u201d Abetz said he wanted to see a full disclosure of Pyne\u2019s new role to ensure his former colleague had not breached the guidelines. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, suggested on Friday the issue might end up before the privileges committee. Pyne\u2019s appointment has also prompted frustration from the Australia Defence Association, which says ministers should be subject to the same requirements as high ranking military officers and senior defence public servants, who are typically required to avoid private work related to their previous dealings in government for 12 months. The former defence minister issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of his responsibilities under the code and intended to abide by them. Pyne said the providing of occasional high-level strategic advice did not equate to lobbying or using information he had acquired in his portfolio. Patrick told Guardian Australia on Sunday there would be no need for a Senate inquiry if Morrison was prepared to take concrete action to enforce the standards. \u201cThere is a statement of ministerial standards, and it either means something or it doesn\u2019t.\u201d EY has issued a statement saying it would ensure that no work Pyne did for the company would breach the ministerial standards. \u201cMr Pyne has made clear that he is totally aware of his obligations under the ministerial code of conduct and is committed to adhering to them,\u201d the statement said.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI am quite sure now that often, very often, in matters of religion and politics a man\u2019s reasoning powers are not above the monkey\u2019s,\u201d wrote Mark Twain.</p> <p>Having written a book about our most common reasoning errors, I would argue that Twain was being rather uncharitable \u2013 to monkeys. Whether we are discussing Trump, Brexit, or the Tory leadership, we have all come across people who appear to have next to no understanding of world events \u2013 but who talk with the utmost confidence and conviction. And the latest psychological research can now help us to understand why.</p> <p>Consider the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612464058\" title=\"\">\u201cillusion of explanatory depth\u201d</a>. When asked about government policies and their consequences, most people believe that they could explain their workings in great detail. If put to the test, however, their explanations are vague and incoherent. The problem is that we confuse a shallow familiarity with general concepts for real, in-depth knowledge.</p> <p>Besides being less substantial than we think, our knowledge is also highly selective: we conveniently remember facts that support our beliefs and forget others. When it comes to understanding the EU, for instance, Brexiters will know the overall costs of membership, while remainers will cite its numerous advantages. Although the overall level of knowledge is equal on both sides, there is little overlap in the details.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Simply asking why people support or oppose a policy is\u00a0pointless. You need to ask how something works to\u00a0have\u00a0an effect</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Politics can also scramble our critical thinking skills. Psychological studies show that people fail to notice the logical fallacies in an argument if the conclusion supports their viewpoint; if they are shown contrary evidence, however, they will be far more critical of the tiniest hole in the argument. This phenomenon is known as \u201cmotivated reasoning\u201d.</p> <p>A high standard of education doesn\u2019t necessarily protect us from these flaws. Graduates, for instance, often <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12280\" title=\"\">overestimate their understanding of their degree subject</a>: although they remember the general content, they have forgotten the details. \u201cPeople confuse their current level of understanding with their peak knowledge,\u201d Prof Matthew Fisher of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, says. That false sense of expertise can, in turn, lead them to feel that they have the licence to be more closed-minded in their political views \u2013 an attitude known as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115001006\" title=\"\">\u201cearned dogmatism\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Little wonder that discussions about politics can leave us feeling that we are banging our heads against a brick wall \u2013 even when talking to people we might otherwise respect. Fortunately, recent psychological research also offers evidence-based ways towards achieving more fruitful discussions.</p> <h2><strong>Ask \u2018how\u2019 rather than </strong><strong>\u2018why\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Thanks to the illusion of explanatory depth, many political arguments will be based on false premises, spoken with great confidence but with a minimal understanding of the issues at hand. For this reason, a simple but powerful way of deflating someone\u2019s argument is to ask for more detail. \u201cYou need to get the \u2018other side\u2019 focusing on how something would play itself out, in a step by step fashion\u201d, says Prof Dan Johnson at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. By revealing the shallowness of their existing knowledge, this prompts a more moderate and humble attitude.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ff4e887a146b350026eeea4f72a74062f2e272d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ff4e887a146b350026eeea4f72a74062f2e272d/0_0_4800_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"steve bray and a pro brexit protester face off at parliament in january 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray and a pro-Brexit protester face off outside parliament earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.philipfernbach.com/\" title=\"\">Prof Philip Fernbach</a> at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and colleagues asked participants in cap-and-trade schemes \u2013 designed to limit companies\u2019 carbon emissions \u2013 to describe in depth how they worked. Subjects initially took strongly polarised views but after the limits of their knowledge were exposed, their attitudes became more moderate and less biased.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that simply asking why people supported or opposed the policy \u2013 without requiring them to explain how it works \u2013 had no effect, since those reasons could be shallower (\u201cIt helps the environment\u201d) with little detail. You need to ask how something works to get the effect.</p> <p>If you are debating the merits of a no-deal Brexit, you might ask someone to describe exactly how the UK\u2019s international trade would change under WTO terms. If you are challenging a climate emergency denier, you might ask them to describe exactly how their alternative theories can explain the recent rise in temperatures. It\u2019s a strategy that the broadcaster James O\u2019Brien employs on his LBC talk show \u2013 to powerful effect.</p> <h2><strong>Fill their knowledge gap with a convincing story</strong></h2> <p>If you are trying to debunk a particular falsehood \u2013 like a conspiracy theory or fake news \u2013 you should make sure that your explanation offers a convincing, coherent narrative that fills all the gaps left in the other person\u2019s understanding.</p> <p>Consider the following <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/displacing-misinformation-about-events-an-experimental-test-of-causal-corrections/69550AB61F4E3F7C2CD03532FC740D05\" title=\"\">experiment</a> by Prof Brendan Nyhan of the University of Michigan and Prof Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter. Subjects read stories about a fictional senator allegedly under investigation for bribery who had subsequently resigned from his post. Written evidence \u2013 a letter from prosecutors confirming his innocence \u2013 did little to change the participants\u2019 suspicions of his guilt. But when offered an alternative explanation for his resignation \u2013 to take on another role \u2013 participants changed their minds. The same can be seen in murder trials: people are more likely to accept someone\u2019s innocence if another suspect has also been accused, since that fills the biggest gap in the story: whodunnit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22c90e8ad5ec537d1811f80f338d07561621951d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22c90e8ad5ec537d1811f80f338d07561621951d/0_0_3000_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"boris johnson, jeremy hunt, michael gove, sajid javid and rory stewart taking part in a bbc tv debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart taking part in a BBC TV debate earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The persuasive power of well-constructed narratives means that it\u2019s often useful to discuss the sources of misinformation, so that the person can understand why they were being misled in the first place. Anti-vaxxers, for instance, may believe a medical conspiracy to cover up the supposed dangers of vaccines. You are more likely to change minds if you replace that narrative with an equally cohesive and convincing story \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/andrew-wakefield\" title=\"\">Andrew Wakefield</a>\u2019s scientific fraud, and the fact that he was set to profit from his paper linking autism to MMR vaccines. Just stating the scientific evidence will not be as persuasive.</p> <h2><strong>Reframe the issue</strong></h2> <p>Each of our beliefs is deeply rooted in a much broader and more complex political ideology. Climate crisis denial, for instance, is now inextricably linked to beliefs in free trade, capitalism and the dangers of environmental regulation.</p> <p>Attacking one issue may therefore threaten to unravel someone\u2019s whole worldview \u2013 a feeling that triggers emotionally charged motivated reasoning. It is for this reason that <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9587\" title=\"\">highly educated Republicans</a> in the US deny the overwhelming evidence.</p> <p>You are not going to alter someone\u2019s whole political ideology in one discussion, so a better strategy is to disentangle the issue at hand from their broader beliefs, or to explain how the facts can still be accommodated into their worldview. A free-market capitalist who denies global warming might be far more receptive to the evidence if you explain that the development of renewable energies could lead to technological breakthroughs and generate economic growth.</p> <h2><strong>Appeal to an alternative identity</strong></h2> <p>If the attempt to reframe the issue fails, you might have more success by appealing to another part of the person\u2019s identity entirely.</p> <p>Someone\u2019s political affiliation will never completely define them, after all. Besides being a conservative or a socialist, a Brexiter or a remainer, we associate ourselves with other traits and values \u2013 things like our profession, or our role as a parent. We might see ourselves as a particularly honest person, or someone who is especially creative. \u201cAll people have multiple identities,\u201d says Prof Jay Van Bavel at New York University, who studies the neuroscience of the <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/comments/S1364-6613(18)30017-2\" title=\"\">\u201cpartisan brain\u201d</a>. \u201cThese identities can become active at any given time, depending on the circumstances.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You are more likely to achieve your aims by arguing gently and kindly. You will also come across better to onlookers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s natural that when talking about politics, the salient identity will be our support for a particular party or movement. But when people are asked to first reflect on their other, nonpolitical values, they tend to become <a href=\"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2010.01210.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291530-2415.THESOCIALPSYCHOLOGYOFTHE2008USPRESIDENTIALELECTION\" title=\"\">more objective in discussion on highly partisan issues</a>, as they stop viewing facts through their ideological lens.</p> <p>You could try to use this to your advantage during a heated conversation, with subtle flattery that appeals to another identity and its set of values; if you are talking to a science teacher, you might try to emphasise their capacity to appraise evidence even-handedly. The aim is to help them recognise that they can change their mind on certain issues while staying true to other important elements of their personality.</p> <h2><strong>Persuade them to take an outside perspective</strong></h2> <p>Another simple strategy to encourage a more detached and rational mindset is to ask your conversation partner to imagine the argument from the viewpoint of someone from another country. How, for example, would someone in Australia or Iceland view Boris Johnson as our new prime minister?</p> <p>Prof Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan, and Prof Igor Grossmann at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, have shown that this strategy increases <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2011-13461-001\" title=\"\">\u201cpsychological distance\u201d</a> from the issue at hand and cools emotionally charged reasoning so that you can see things more objectively. During the US presidential elections, for instance, their participants were asked to consider how someone in Iceland would view the candidates. They were subsequently more willing to accept the limits of their knowledge and to listen to alternative viewpoints; after the experiment, they were even more likely to join a bipartisan discussion group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34023e88931cbe906d911ea6c505e7eeeaf63ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34023e88931cbe906d911ea6c505e7eeeaf63ed2/0_542_4160_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"front pages of two new york newspapers with contrasting headlines about the withdrawal of the us from the paris climate agreement, june 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front pages of two New York newspapers on Friday 2 June 2017, as Donald Trump pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard B Levine/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is only one way to increase someone\u2019s psychological distance, and there are many others. If you are considering policies with potentially long-term consequences, you could ask them to imagine viewing the situation through the eyes of someone in the future. However you do it, encouraging this shift in perspective should make your friend or relative more receptive to the facts you are presenting, rather than simply reacting with knee-jerk dismissals.</p> <h2><strong>Be kind</strong></h2> <p>Here\u2019s a lesson that certain polemicists in the media might do well to remember \u2013 people are generally much more rational in their arguments, and more willing to own up to the limits of their knowledge and understanding, if they are treated with respect and compassion. Aggression, by contrast, leads them to feel that their identity is threatened, which in turn can make them closed-minded.</p> <p>Assuming that the purpose of your argument is to change minds, rather than to signal your own superiority, <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/dxwpu/\" title=\"\">you are much more likely to achieve your aims by arguing gently and kindly rather than belligerently</a>, and affirming your respect for the person, even if you are telling them some hard truths. As a bonus, you will also come across better to onlookers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work showing that third-party observers always attribute high levels of competence when the person is conducting themselves with more civility,\u201d says Dr Joe Vitriol, a psychologist at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. As Lady Mary Wortley Montagu put it in the 18th century: \u201cCivility costs nothing and buys everything.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>David Robson is the author of <em>The Intelligence Trap: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things and How to Make Wiser Decisions</em> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320).

Although the overall level of knowledge is equal on both sides, there is little overlap in the details. Politics can also scramble our critical thinking skills. Psychological studies show that people fail to notice the logical fallacies in an argument if the conclusion supports their viewpoint; if they are shown contrary evidence, however, they will be far more critical of the tiniest hole in the argument. This phenomenon is known as \u201cmotivated reasoning\u201d. A high standard of education doesn\u2019t necessarily protect us from these flaws. Graduates, for instance, often overestimate their understanding of their degree subject: although they remember the general content, they have forgotten the details. \u201cPeople confuse their current level of understanding with their peak knowledge,\u201d Prof Matthew Fisher of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, says. That false sense of expertise can, in turn, lead them to feel that they have the licence to be more closed-minded in their political views \u2013 an attitude known as \u201cearned dogmatism\u201d. Little wonder that discussions about politics can leave us feeling that we are banging our heads against a brick wall \u2013 even when talking to people we might otherwise respect. Fortunately, recent psychological research also offers evidence-based ways towards achieving more fruitful discussions. Ask \u2018how\u2019 rather than \u2018why\u2019 Thanks to the illusion of explanatory depth, many political arguments will be based on false premises, spoken with great confidence but with a minimal understanding of the issues at hand. For this reason, a simple but powerful way of deflating someone\u2019s argument is to ask for more detail. \u201cYou need to get the \u2018other side\u2019 focusing on how something would play itself out, in a step by step fashion\u201d, says Prof Dan Johnson at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. By revealing the shallowness of their existing knowledge, this prompts a more moderate and humble attitude. In 2013, Prof Philip Fernbach at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and colleagues asked participants in cap-and-trade schemes \u2013 designed to limit companies\u2019 carbon emissions \u2013 to describe in depth how they worked. Subjects initially took strongly polarised views but after the limits of their knowledge were exposed, their attitudes became more moderate and less biased. It\u2019s important to note that simply asking why people supported or opposed the policy \u2013 without requiring them to explain how it works \u2013 had no effect, since those reasons could be shallower (\u201cIt helps the environment\u201d) with little detail. You need to ask how something works to get the effect. If you are debating the merits of a no-deal Brexit, you might ask someone to describe exactly how the UK\u2019s international trade would change under WTO terms. If you are challenging a climate emergency denier, you might ask them to describe exactly how their alternative theories can explain the recent rise in temperatures. It\u2019s a strategy that the broadcaster James O\u2019Brien employs on his LBC talk show \u2013 to powerful effect. Fill their knowledge gap with a convincing story If you are trying to debunk a particular falsehood \u2013 like a conspiracy theory or fake news \u2013 you should make sure that your explanation offers a convincing, coherent narrative that fills all the gaps left in the other person\u2019s understanding. Consider the following experiment by Prof Brendan Nyhan of the University of Michigan and Prof Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter. Subjects read stories about a fictional senator allegedly under investigation for bribery who had subsequently resigned from his post. Written evidence \u2013 a letter from prosecutors confirming his innocence \u2013 did little to change the participants\u2019 suspicions of his guilt. But when offered an alternative explanation for his resignation \u2013 to take on another role \u2013 participants changed their minds. The same can be seen in murder trials: people are more likely to accept someone\u2019s innocence if another suspect has also been accused, since that fills the biggest gap in the story: whodunnit. The persuasive power of well-constructed narratives means that it\u2019s often useful to discuss the sources of misinformation, so that the person can understand why they were being misled in the first place. Anti-vaxxers, for instance, may believe a medical conspiracy to cover up the supposed dangers of vaccines. You are more likely to change minds if you replace that narrative with an equally cohesive and convincing story \u2013 such as Andrew Wakefield\u2019s scientific fraud, and the fact that he was set to profit from his paper linking autism to MMR vaccines. Just stating the scientific evidence will not be as persuasive. Reframe the issue Each of our beliefs is deeply rooted in a much broader and more complex political ideology. Climate crisis denial, for instance, is now inextricably linked to beliefs in free trade, capitalism and the dangers of environmental regulation. Attacking one issue may therefore threaten to unravel someone\u2019s whole worldview \u2013 a feeling that triggers emotionally charged motivated reasoning. It is for this reason that highly educated Republicans in the US deny the overwhelming evidence. You are not going to alter someone\u2019s whole political ideology in one discussion, so a better strategy is to disentangle the issue at hand from their broader beliefs, or to explain how the facts can still be accommodated into their worldview. A free-market capitalist who denies global warming might be far more receptive to the evidence if you explain that the development of renewable energies could lead to technological breakthroughs and generate economic growth. Appeal to an alternative identity If the attempt to reframe the issue fails, you might have more success by appealing to another part of the person\u2019s identity entirely. Someone\u2019s political affiliation will never completely define them, after all. Besides being a conservative or a socialist, a Brexiter or a remainer, we associate ourselves with other traits and values \u2013 things like our profession, or our role as a parent. We might see ourselves as a particularly honest person, or someone who is especially creative. \u201cAll people have multiple identities,\u201d says Prof Jay Van Bavel at New York University, who studies the neuroscience of the \u201cpartisan brain\u201d. \u201cThese identities can become active at any given time, depending on the circumstances.\u201d It\u2019s natural that when talking about politics, the salient identity will be our support for a particular party or movement. But when people are asked to first reflect on their other, nonpolitical values, they tend to become more objective in discussion on highly partisan issues, as they stop viewing facts through their ideological lens. You could try to use this to your advantage during a heated conversation, with subtle flattery that appeals to another identity and its set of values; if you are talking to a science teacher, you might try to emphasise their capacity to appraise evidence even-handedly. The aim is to help them recognise that they can change their mind on certain issues while staying true to other important elements of their personality. Persuade them to take an outside perspective Another simple strategy to encourage a more detached and rational mindset is to ask your conversation partner to imagine the argument from the viewpoint of someone from another country. How, for example, would someone in Australia or Iceland view Boris Johnson as our new prime minister? Prof Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan, and Prof Igor Grossmann at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, have shown that this strategy increases \u201cpsychological distance\u201d from the issue at hand and cools emotionally charged reasoning so that you can see things more objectively. During the US presidential elections, for instance, their participants were asked to consider how someone in Iceland would view the candidates. They were subsequently more willing to accept the limits of their knowledge and to listen to alternative viewpoints; after the experiment, they were even more likely to join a bipartisan discussion group. This is only one way to increase someone\u2019s psychological distance, and there are many others. If you are considering policies with potentially long-term consequences, you could ask them to imagine viewing the situation through the eyes of someone in the future. However you do it, encouraging this shift in perspective should make your friend or relative more receptive to the facts you are presenting, rather than simply reacting with knee-jerk dismissals. Be kind Here\u2019s a lesson that certain polemicists in the media might do well to remember \u2013 people are generally much more rational in their arguments, and more willing to own up to the limits of their knowledge and understanding, if they are treated with respect and compassion. Aggression, by contrast, leads them to feel that their identity is threatened, which in turn can make them closed-minded. Assuming that the purpose of your argument is to change minds, rather than to signal your own superiority, you are much more likely to achieve your aims by arguing gently and kindly rather than belligerently, and affirming your respect for the person, even if you are telling them some hard truths. As a bonus, you will also come across better to onlookers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work showing that third-party observers always attribute high levels of competence when the person is conducting themselves with more civility,\u201d says Dr Joe Vitriol, a psychologist at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. As Lady Mary Wortley Montagu put it in the 18th century: \u201cCivility costs nothing and buys everything.\u201d \u2022 David Robson is the author of The Intelligence Trap: Why Smart People Do Stupid Things and How to Make Wiser Decisions (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320).

During <em>Midsommar</em>, I listened heavily to the latest album by the Icelandic musician \u00d3lafur Arnalds, which was a massive help. There were so many things in <em>Midsommar</em> that I didn\u2019t really know how to access, so I always had my headphones at the ready. There\u2019s so much emotion and excitement in his music \u2013 it\u2019s sad, but also really hopeful \u2013 that it became a way of talking to Ari [Aster, director of <em>Midsommar</em>] about scenes. [Arnalds] has a fantastic way of forcing you to feel, and I find it quite therapeutic to get all of that out. And he once liked a tweet of mine and I nearly died.</p> <h2>2.

It\u2019s a take on the Manson family, but it\u2019s less about him and more about the connection between two women in the group, and what lust and attraction can make you do. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story as well, and I really loved the way bodies are described and the difference that one summer can make when going through puberty. That was really beautiful to read. It was nice to spend time with the book and soak it all up.</p> <h2>3.

When it first started, I couldn\u2019t quite believe how fantastic the main actors were. It was just so wicked to watch these five American mums who are supposedly so perfect but are actually a total mess.

It\u2019s done so well that, at first, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a joke or not, but after 10 minutes you realise it has to be.

I\u2019d done a photoshoot with [director] Olivia Wilde in New York the weekend before, so it was really nice to watch the film after talking to her about it. It\u2019s about two girls graduating from high school who decide to have the night of their lives, because they studied too hard to have fun. It\u2019s a fantastic film that has a different way of viewing bodies and people and romance \u2013 and the two main actors, Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein, are so bloody brilliant. My mum was laughing just as hard as me and my younger sister.</p> <h2><br>6.

This production had Zawe Ashton, Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Cox and I just loved watching them all on stage together. The timing was impeccable and the stage direction was so exciting. It was a particular joy to watch Zawe on stage because I\u2019ve been a big lover of her stuff for years. She has such presence and it was nice to see her up there really living that role.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Actor Florence Pugh was born in 1996 and raised in Oxfordshire and southern Spain. Part of an arty family \u2013 her mother is a dancer and her three siblings are actors \u2013 she got her screen break in 2014 playing opposite Maisie Williams in coming-of-age drama The Falling. She followed it two years later with a Bifa award-winning lead performance in Lady Macbeth. Last year, she played an actor turned spy in the BBC adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s The Little Drummer Girl, and is now the lead in Ari Aster\u2019s folk-horror movie Midsommar, in cinemas from Friday. 1. Music \u00d3lafur Arnalds: Re:member On whatever job that I\u2019m doing, I always end up getting drawn to songs and making a playlist. During Midsommar, I listened heavily to the latest album by the Icelandic musician \u00d3lafur Arnalds, which was a massive help. There were so many things in Midsommar that I didn\u2019t really know how to access, so I always had my headphones at the ready. There\u2019s so much emotion and excitement in his music \u2013 it\u2019s sad, but also really hopeful \u2013 that it became a way of talking to Ari [Aster, director of Midsommar] about scenes. [Arnalds] has a fantastic way of forcing you to feel, and I find it quite therapeutic to get all of that out. And he once liked a tweet of mine and I nearly died. 2. Book The Girls by Emma Cline I tend to start lots of books but not finish them, because I don\u2019t have that much free time, but this was one book that I finished recently and loved. It\u2019s a take on the Manson family, but it\u2019s less about him and more about the connection between two women in the group, and what lust and attraction can make you do. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story as well, and I really loved the way bodies are described and the difference that one summer can make when going through puberty. That was really beautiful to read. It was nice to spend time with the book and soak it all up. 3. TV Big Little Lies, HBO This was one of my favourite TV series of 2018. I was working with [Big Little Lies star] Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd last year, and he was going straight from The Little Drummer Girl to working on the second season. I couldn\u2019t believe I had to wait a whole year for it \u2013 so this is a really great time for me (I\u2019m one episode in). When it first started, I couldn\u2019t quite believe how fantastic the main actors were. It was just so wicked to watch these five American mums who are supposedly so perfect but are actually a total mess. The way it told the story of domestic abuse was beautifully done and really heartbreaking. 4. Podcast Dear Joan and Jericha This is a podcast in which Vicki Pepperdine and Julia Davis pretend to be two older women who dissect and discuss the biggest issues, which never seem to be bigger than their husbands putting the kettle on or silly stuff like that. It\u2019s done so well that, at first, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a joke or not, but after 10 minutes you realise it has to be. I\u2019m a fan of Julia Davis, and I\u2019ve worked with her before [on Fighting With My Family]. This is one of the less dark things she\u2019s done, but it\u2019s very funny and they\u2019re both great to listen to. 5. Film Booksmart I went to watch this at the lovely little Phoenix cinema in north London with my mum and my younger sister. I\u2019d done a photoshoot with [director] Olivia Wilde in New York the weekend before, so it was really nice to watch the film after talking to her about it. It\u2019s about two girls graduating from high school who decide to have the night of their lives, because they studied too hard to have fun. It\u2019s a fantastic film that has a different way of viewing bodies and people and romance \u2013 and the two main actors, Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein, are so bloody brilliant. My mum was laughing just as hard as me and my younger sister. 6. Play Betrayal at the Harold Pinter theatre, London I watched this on the closing night a few weeks ago and I\u2019m so glad I managed to catch it. I hadn\u2019t seen the play before \u2013 it\u2019s the one that follows a love affair backwards through time \u2013 but I\u2019d studied it in school. This production had Zawe Ashton, Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Cox and I just loved watching them all on stage together. The timing was impeccable and the stage direction was so exciting. It was a particular joy to watch Zawe on stage because I\u2019ve been a big lover of her stuff for years. She has such presence and it was nice to see her up there really living that role.",

I have never forgotten its gloom and glimmer, its slow disclosure and psychological stranglehold. Now the theatre revisits that territory.

Her bustling geniality is so authentic that she might be part of the Almeida backstage team. You can see immediately some of the play\u2019s shifting moods, the disturbing preoccupations in <a href=\"https://esdevlin.com/\" title=\"\">Es Devlin</a>\u2019s magnificent design. A dinky little house \u2013 simple as a child\u2019s drawing or a garden shed \u2013 is perched on a revolve. In darkness it is impenetrable: this is a play about secrets that continually questions whether we can ever know each other. When irradiated with Neil Austin\u2019s lighting (sometimes unsparingly white, sometimes murky), it becomes transparent and rapidly changing: it is a place of wistful innocence, where a small girl perches alone; an angry box in which the members of a hunting lodge roar and stamp; a claustrophobic container for a village; a display case for wounded creatures. Adam Cork\u2019s sound design is threaded through the action, like an echo of anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even Coward\u2019s most languid lines ring out: you are hit by the drilling intelligence behind the drawl</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a strong tradition of plays about false (or possibly false) accusations brought by children against figures in authority \u2013 and the destruction they bring. Lillian Hellman\u2019s <em>The Children\u2019s Hour</em><em> </em>is also set in a school; Arthur Miller\u2019s <em>The Crucible</em> has always drawn strength from being considered a picture of McCarthyism. Timing gives <em>The Hunt</em> a particular skewering interest. Staged when we have been retraining ourselves to hear the previously disregarded voices of children and women bullied by men in power, the play twists the expectations and sympathy of spectators.</p> <p>It is rare to see child performers of such natural assurance as \u2013 on press night \u2013 George Nearn Stuart and Taya Tower: he wild and open, she contained and secretive. They encapsulate the two extremes of temperament in the play \u2013 and the damage wrought by their parents. Poppy Miller is particularly distressing as a distracted, wilful mother. And in the central role \u2013 of a man who has imprinted on his spirit his own father\u2019s love of a solitary life spent on Arctic ships \u2013 Tobias Menzies is extraordinary: clenched, calm and unknowable.</p> <p>So what is the transporting feature of Matthew Warchus\u2019s gleaming, bound-for-success production of <strong><a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2019/present-laughter\" title=\"\">P</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2019/present-laughter\" title=\"\">resent Laughter</a></strong>? The obvious answer is Andrew Scott, proving his wonderful elasticity as an actor. Think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/05/hamlet-almeida-review-andrew-scott-robert-icke\" title=\"\">his Hamlet</a>, convulsed with emotion, and of his fugitive performance in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/27/the-dazzle-andrew-scott-found111-observer-review\" title=\"\">The Dazzle</a></em> \u2013 quite apart from his <em>Sherlock-</em>ing and his unholy success <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/16/andrew-scott-fleabag-sexy-priest-uncharted-territory\" title=\"\">in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/16/andrew-scott-fleabag-sexy-priest-uncharted-territory\" title=\"\">Fleabag</a></em>. Look at him in the part that No\u00ebl Coward wrote for himself: the adored and flattered matinee idol Garry Essendine, doyen of the dressing gown. Essendine may be all posture and persiflage, but he also delivers a kind of truth. His whole point is overdoing it \u2013 \u201cWhere would you be,\u201d he asks his friends and hangers-on, \u201cif I didn\u2019t show off?\u201d Scott shows off superbly: his arms sweep widely; he swoops on a bon mot like a bird of prey; he spins on the spot.

By a clever tweaking of gender in one of the satellite couples, Essendine becomes evidently a lover of men. The play gains in feeling as a consequence, with the ripple of an extra secret. You would think that few stage embraces would be surprising these days, but when Essendine clinches with a male visitor (the two of them struggling out of evening wear in a kind of dance) a woman in the audience gasped loudly. Warchus should employ her to exclaim at each performance \u2013 she added to the drama. The sourness, or melancholy, of the ending \u2013 in which tradition is turned on its head as Essendine pleads with the wife from whom he is separated not to return to him \u2013 is underlined, as the couple sit apart in the sinking light.

For example, heavy rain and cloud across northern Europe is likely to become more common as the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position.</p>\n    <p>However, this year\u2019s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the negative impacts of a heatwave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The body\u2019s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies and older people are less well able to regulate their temperature and should stay in well-ventilated conditions. In the 2003 European heatwave there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night.</p>\n    <p>There is also an impact on farmers. While warmth at the right time is crucial for crop growth, excessively high temperatures can inhibit that growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fiona-harvey\">Fiona Harvey</a>&nbsp;</b><i>Environment correspondent</i><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There are 800 water taps on site and mobile water units, with 37 WaterAid kiosks giving out water and bottles.

Saturday night saw The Killers top the bill at the Pyramid stage with Liam Gallagher, the Chemical Brothers and Janet Jackson also performing at the festival\u2019s halfway point. The Cure are the final headline act on Sunday night, with Kylie Minogue and Miley Cyrus also taking to the Pyramid stage. Business at ice-cream vans across the site was booming. \u201cI\u2019ve never worked at Glastonbury before, but I\u2019ve worked other festivals and we are very, very busy,\u201d said one ice-cream seller. He said that most people were buying ice lollies and drinks, with the fruit pastille lolly the most popular. There are 800 water taps on site and mobile water units, with 37 WaterAid kiosks giving out water and bottles. Free sun cream was also available at information points and property lockups, and the festival said extra shaded areas would be opened if needed. Sunday is expected to be cooler, with a maximum 23C predicted. The Met Office and NHS England issued a level two alert for the heat, suggesting that people who are vulnerable should stay out of the sun when it\u2019s at its hottest. This year Glastonbury has installed a plastic-free system, so no single-use plastic can be bought on site. The move was motivated by the desire to save on clean-up costs, with the final bill for the removal of rubbish from the site estimated at \u00a3785,000. In 2017, the last time the festival was held, visitors used 1.3 million plastic bottles. The festival previously banned food traders from using plastic plates and cutlery, requesting compostable alternatives instead. Glastonbury\u2019s wristbands are made of cloth, single-use plastic cups are not used in the bars and only paper straws are available.",

Rookie centre Naden was the hero with two tries in the final half-hour, including a memorable 90-metre solo try with three minutes remaining to put his team two points in front. Maloney was deemed offside from the subsequent Warriors short kick-off and Patrick Herbert held his nerve, levelling the scores with a 35m penalty in the final minute of regular time.</p> <p>A week after his influential State of Origin performance for NSW and without injured halves partner Nathan Cleary, Maloney capped an exceptional game with the winning field goal, after he and opposite Blake Green had both missed earlier attempts. Maloney also laid on two of his team\u2019s three tries, setting up a leaping Naden with a pinpoint bomb to start the fightback from 16-6 down.</p> <p>The Warriors appeared destined to end their miserable run of home form when David Fusitu\u2019a crossed after a fuming Penrith had been reduced to 11 players. <br></p> <p>Maloney, who had a running battle with referee Gerard Sutton, was firstly enraged by Liam Martin\u2019s 10-minute punishment for repeated Panthers offending soon before halftime.

Tigers ruck-forward Mabior Chol starred in his third senior game as Richmond broke their three-game losing streak and returned to the top eight with the 16.7 (103) to 10.10 (70) win on Sunday at Marvel Stadium.</p> <p>The Saints have made it clear the team needs to claim a big scalp or two for Richardson to retain his job beyond this season. They lacked nothing for effort - and it was a significant improvement on last week\u2019s shocker against Brisbane - but they could not maintain a promising first half. After starting the game with 7.0, St Kilda butchered their chances in the last term and sprayed a wasteful 2.7 as the Tigers piled on seven goals.</p> <p>Chol sealed the win in the last quarter when he capitalised on St Kilda\u2019s mix-up at a boundary throw in, grabbing the ball and kicking an easy goal. The Sudanese-born player took nine marks and kicked three goals. Sydney Stack also kicked four goals and Dustin Martin racked up 36 disposals.</p> <p>Richmond, who came out of the mid-season bye with seven changes, looked scratchy early. Josh Bruce kicked the first goal of the game after a minute as the Saints made a bright start. They kicked the opening three goals of the match - the first time St Kilda have managed that this season - and Richmond were on the back foot.</p> <p>Stack and Chol made early statements, kicking the Tigers\u2019 first two goals to keep it tight at quarter-time. After Stack also kicked the opening goal of the second term, St Kilda went on a four-goal run and they broke out to a 23-point lead.</p> <p>But again Chol and Stack kicked goals and the Tigers were only four points down at the main break as the 2017 premiers started finding their groove. Richmond kicked another four goals in the third term and the dam wall was creaking.</p> <p>Cult figure Matt Parker\u2019s goal late in the third term stalled the Richmond surge, but the seven-point Tigers lead at three-quarter time felt like a lot more.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T06:15:14.017Z\">at 7.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1848fa8f080e8285151cf2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-30T05:35:06.033Z\">6.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rugby: </strong>With the Brumbies out of the Super Rugby race, Australia\u2019s focus now turns to September\u2019s Rugby World Cup in Japan.

      "bodyText": "Thanks everyone for keeping me company on this afternoon of sport. Time for me to head off as we get ready to launch into our cricket live blog. Hang around and see if India can get the job done or if England can manage to do it for their home fans. Enjoy and see you next time! The Dees couldn\u2019t hold on to their half-time lead and the Lions slowly but surely ran away with the game. Eric Hipwood starred for the home team with five goals, while teammate Dayne Zorko was also in scorching form, with three goals, two behinds and 31 disposals. The win will give the Lions plenty of confidence as they prepare for their big match up against the fourth placed Giants in Sydney next weekend. A pounce on a loose ball and an all-out sprint for the tryline by Sharks\u2019 interchange player Jack Williams threatened to derail the Bulldogs\u2019 dreams of a fourth win this season with 90 seconds on the clock. But utter desperation in defence saw the home team walk away with the two points and skip happily into their bye round, despite not scoring in the second half. Some kicking practice on the agenda for the Sharks as they failed to convert any of their three tries. Cricket: It\u2019s about 45 minutes until our live blog kicks off, which is just enough time to listen to an episode of The Guardian\u2019s cricket podcast The Spin. May I recommend this one, which features Australia\u2019s own Geoff Lemon and Felicity Ward. Lots of laughs to be had. Rugby league: This is a great story from the UK about the PDRL - the Super League adjacent competition for players with physical disabilities. Aaron Moon\u2019s story is a fascinating one and this competition is sure to produce many more. Tennis: Serena Williams is keen to partner Andy Murray in the mixed doubles it seems, after Murray was turned down by a number of women\u2019s players he approached. Whether or not it will come to pass remains to be seen, but it would certainly add some interest and fire to the mixed doubles tournament. Hockey: Just for something a little bit different on this Sunday evening, the Hockeyroos finished with silver in the inaugural FIH Hockey Pro League. The Australians were locked up 2-2 with the Netherlands at full time before falling to the home team 4-3 in a penalty shootout. The Kookaburras will play their Pro League final tonight against Belgium. AFL: Some warm and fuzzy news out of the Saints and Tigers game, with over $100,000 raised for Maddie Riewoldt\u2019s Vision, a charity that raises money for medical research into Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome. Cricket: Not long now until our live blog for the England v India match begins. While we wait, it seems like a good time to re-live some England misery (to be fair, any time is a good time for that). And if you ever doubted Geoff Lemon\u2019s ability to write an entire article about one delivery, he has well and truly proved you wrong with this wonderful article about Starc\u2019s yorker to remove Stokes. Geoff is the master of imagery and this article is no exception. My personal favourite line is \u201cStarc is long and lean, a figure stretched out like a Quentin Blake drawing.\u201d Enjoy reading this and picturing Starc as the BFG, with Aaron Finch perched on his hand peering at him quizzically like a little Sophie. NRL: Half-time in Homebush and it\u2019s the Bulldogs who have the ascendancy over their southern rivals, leading 14-8. The Sharks appeared to have been caught out early by a Bulldogs team hungry for a win, having only won three games this season and not recording a win since Round 10. With their bye coming next week the Dogs will be desperate to secure this victory, however they will need to lift again in the second half after letting in two tries late in the first half. Netball: The delightful Erin Delahunty wrote this week about the Folau saga finally creeping into Super Netball after Maria Folau reposted her husband\u2019s GoFundMe campaign. Lots of interesting implications for the competition and how players are being prepared to comment on issues like this in the increasingly professional era. AFL: Half-time in Brisbane and the Dees are leading the Lions 6.5 (41) to 4.11 (35). Bad news for the Lions as a groggy Oscar McInerney was led from the field with five minutes remaining in the half with blood streaming from his nose after a clash with Christian Salem\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s been a scrappy game so far and both teams will be looking for improvement in the second half. Cycling: Another great read from during the week about the lack of good Tour de France level races for women. While La Course was by all accounts a challenging course and produced a great spectacle, it lacks the gravity of a multi-day race. The Warriors looked the goods in the first half, but a strong second half from the Panthers saw the game go into golden point that was sealed by a James Moloney field goal. A pretty good week in all for Moloney, after steering the Blues to victory in Origin in Perth last Sunday. From AAP: Naden the hero as Panthers sink Warriors Brent Naden scored an NRL try for the ages and James Maloney had the final say as Penrith snatched a dramatic 19-18 golden point win over the Warriors in Auckland. The Panthers unleashed one of the gutsiest performances seen on Mt Smart Stadium, overcoming two contentious sin bin rulings and a 10-point deficit to notch their fifth straight win. Rookie centre Naden was the hero with two tries in the final half-hour, including a memorable 90-metre solo try with three minutes remaining to put his team two points in front. Maloney was deemed offside from the subsequent Warriors short kick-off and Patrick Herbert held his nerve, levelling the scores with a 35m penalty in the final minute of regular time. A week after his influential State of Origin performance for NSW and without injured halves partner Nathan Cleary, Maloney capped an exceptional game with the winning field goal, after he and opposite Blake Green had both missed earlier attempts. Maloney also laid on two of his team\u2019s three tries, setting up a leaping Naden with a pinpoint bomb to start the fightback from 16-6 down. The Warriors appeared destined to end their miserable run of home form when David Fusitu\u2019a crossed after a fuming Penrith had been reduced to 11 players. Maloney, who had a running battle with referee Gerard Sutton, was firstly enraged by Liam Martin\u2019s 10-minute punishment for repeated Panthers offending soon before halftime. He believed he hadn\u2019t been given sufficient warning that a sin bin was looming. The veteran\u2019s blood pressure doubled soon after the break when halves partner Jarome Luai was given his marching orders, reducing the visitors to 11 for three minutes. Sutton deemed Luai had committed a professional foul for tripping Warriors skipper Roger Tuivasa-Sheck - a questionable ruling on two counts. The contact appeared accidental and Tuivasa-Sheck had already knocked on in the lead-up. Maloney\u2019s men somehow regrouped in the most spectacular win of their mid-season revival, highlighted by 23-year-old Naden\u2019s defence shredding run in just his fourth NRL game. Cricket: This delightfully scathing article on Geoff Boycott\u2019s opinions on a no-deal Brexit (I can\u2019t say I ever thought that was a sentence I would compose) by Marina Hyde during the week is just so good. Do yourself a favour and have a read. It had me cackling on the train with lines like \u201cIn fact, it is rather easier to see his whole career as being of a coherent piece when you remember it is all underpinned by the same inability to think much \u2013 or indeed anywhere \u2013 beyond what suits himself.\u201d Women\u2019s sport: I don\u2019t like to toot my own horn* but while you\u2019re enjoying this lovely afternoon of sport you might enjoy reading this article I wrote about our world-beating sportswomen during the week. *This isn\u2019t true, I love tooting my own horn. After a slow start, the Tigers were simply too good for their local rivals, building their lead throughout the second half. Sydney Stack was a standout, with four goals and 15 disposals, while Josh Bruce did his best to keep the Saints in the game with three goals and 13 disposals. From AAP: Tigers\u2019 AFL win adds to Saints pressure The pressure ramps up on St Kilda coach Alan Richardson, after Richmond broke clear in the last term for a 33-point AFL win. Tigers ruck-forward Mabior Chol starred in his third senior game as Richmond broke their three-game losing streak and returned to the top eight with the 16.7 (103) to 10.10 (70) win on Sunday at Marvel Stadium. The Saints have made it clear the team needs to claim a big scalp or two for Richardson to retain his job beyond this season. They lacked nothing for effort - and it was a significant improvement on last week\u2019s shocker against Brisbane - but they could not maintain a promising first half. After starting the game with 7.0, St Kilda butchered their chances in the last term and sprayed a wasteful 2.7 as the Tigers piled on seven goals. Chol sealed the win in the last quarter when he capitalised on St Kilda\u2019s mix-up at a boundary throw in, grabbing the ball and kicking an easy goal. The Sudanese-born player took nine marks and kicked three goals. Sydney Stack also kicked four goals and Dustin Martin racked up 36 disposals. Richmond, who came out of the mid-season bye with seven changes, looked scratchy early. Josh Bruce kicked the first goal of the game after a minute as the Saints made a bright start. They kicked the opening three goals of the match - the first time St Kilda have managed that this season - and Richmond were on the back foot. Stack and Chol made early statements, kicking the Tigers\u2019 first two goals to keep it tight at quarter-time. After Stack also kicked the opening goal of the second term, St Kilda went on a four-goal run and they broke out to a 23-point lead. But again Chol and Stack kicked goals and the Tigers were only four points down at the main break as the 2017 premiers started finding their groove. Richmond kicked another four goals in the third term and the dam wall was creaking. Cult figure Matt Parker\u2019s goal late in the third term stalled the Richmond surge, but the seven-point Tigers lead at three-quarter time felt like a lot more. Rugby: With the Brumbies out of the Super Rugby race, Australia\u2019s focus now turns to September\u2019s Rugby World Cup in Japan. Michael Cheika says the Wallabies will try a new style of attack after the departure of former attack coach Stephen Larkham. Though \u201cnew\u201d is likely code for \u201cactually quite old\u201d because isn\u2019t that always the way rugby likes to do things? Tennis: Still on Barty, Kevin Mitchell gave us some incredible insight into the champion this week as she prepares to embark on her Wimbledon campaign. Although the life of an athlete often seems wonderfully exciting to us mere mortals, I found the line \u201cI would love to be home every single minute of every single day\u201d so resonant. Barty clearly loves her tennis, but the struggle between playing the sport she loves and the constant travel when you\u2019re such a homebody is so striking. Wimbledon: Another great piece from this week is Simon Cambers\u2019 analysis of some of the big names carrying injuries into Wimbledon. Not so for Australia\u2019s Ash Barty who, despite pulling out of the Nature Valley International in Eastbourne, appears fit and raring to go as she enters her first grand slam as world number one. Cricket: It seems strange to be talking about cricket so much in the depths of winter, but definitely strange in a good way. The women\u2019s Ashes are coming up and the games are certain to be incredible. Former Australian captain Lisa Sthalekar gave us a great primer for the tournament during the week. Can\u2019t wait to see what Meg Lanning and her team have in store for us when it begins. NRL: Half-time over in Auckland and it\u2019s the Warriors leading the Panthers 12-6. A penalty goal broke the deadlock for the home team in the 31st minute before Bunty Afoa pushed the Warriors further ahead with his 37th minute try. Women\u2019s World Cup: Hope Solo has provided some great insight during the World Cup and this is a great read on how the Lionesses can overcome the might of the US team. No doubt it will be an incredible semi-final on Wednesday and certainly worth the 5am alarm. Cricket: With the big game between India and England coming up later this evening, now is a good chance to re-live last night\u2019s game - unless you\u2019re a Black Caps fan that is! Mitchell Starc seems to be building a fairly decent career out of crushing New Zealand and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be the only one wondering if he\u2019s could skip on over to Wallabies training camp once he\u2019s done with the Cricket World Cup? Our intrepid reporter Geoff Lemon was on the ground to witness all the glorious Kiwi-destroying action and has analysed the win beautifully. Netball: With the Super Netball at the start of their Netball World Cup break, this weekend the finals of the Australian Netball League filled the void for fans who were at a loss. A nailbiter of a grand final was won by the Victorian Fury, defeating NSW Waratahs 53-52. In the earlier bronze medal match, the Tasmanian Magpies defeated the Canberra Giants 59-50. A lot of great young talent on show, many faces who will no doubt be in the mix for the Diamonds team at the 2027 Netball World Cup, which the NSW Government this week announced it will be bidding for in partnership with Netball Australia. AFL: Half-time in Melbourne and the Saints have a narrow lead over the Tigers, ahead 7.0 (42) - 6.2 (38). Sydney Stack has been dominant for Richmond, with three goals and seven disposals in the first half, while the Saints have shared the scoring more evenly. Welcome back to another big afternoon of sport with our Sportwatch live blog. We\u2019ve got some NRL and AFL to take you through to the start of the cricket tonight, where it\u2019s a big game between England and India with the home side desperate to secure a much-needed win.",

      "body": "<p>When the Anglican divine John William Burgon published his classic two-volume biography of Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579) in 1839, he introduced his readers to a character \u2013 government banker, founder of the Royal Exchange, putative proponent of \u201cGresham\u2019s law\u201d \u2013 who had lived a life of \u201cunsullied honour and integrity\u201d. For Burgon, Gresham was among the most illustrious ancestors \u201cof which our metropolis can boast\u201d \u2013 not just owing to \u201cthe skill with which he contrived to control the exchange with foreign countries\u201d, thereby laying \u201cthe foundations of England\u2019s commercial greatness\u201d, but also because his qualities spoke of an upstanding friend, associate, husband, father. When Gresham died, he deserved to be remembered as a \u201ctrue patriot, beloved in private life and honoured in his public station\u201d.</p> <p>Burgon\u2019s remarks are emblematic of the 19th-century view of Gresham as an honourable and self-made man: Queen Victoria\u2019s recorder considered him an \u201ceminent citizen and chief benefactor of his kind\u201d. And such depictions are not without merit. But as the historian <a href=\"http://www.johnguy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">John Guy</a> argues in this assiduously researched new account of Gresham\u2019s life: \u201cSomething subtler is needed.\u201d Accordingly, Guy has consulted several \u201clarge caches of often entirely virgin sources\u201d in order to offer a reassessment of Gresham\u2019s professional undertakings and \u201ca fuller investigation of Gresham\u2019s private life than anything attempted before\u201d. It is an enterprise from which he does not emerge well.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He left his widow to deal with an unconscionable level of debt and a bewildering array of duped and angry creditors</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Far from being the self-made man of 19th-century hagiography, Gresham was born to Audrey Lynne and the wealthy and well-connected merchant Sir Richard Gresham at Cheapside in (we think) 1519. Thereafter he was not, as certain Victorian scholars suggested, abandoned in a field only to be discovered by a passerby whose attention was roused by the chirping of a grasshopper, but raised by his father and stepmother, Isabel Worsopp, who entered the family home following the death of his mother in 1522. He received his education first at the Mercers\u2019 Company \u201calphabet\u201d school, followed by St Paul\u2019s and Gonville Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated at the age of 11.</p> <p>With his formal education complete, Gresham was introduced by his father to the tenebrous financial secrets of international exchange. He would go on, all the while beetling between the financial centres of London and Antwerp, to make a living initially in the employ of the Mercers\u2019 Company, before becoming government banker to Edward VI, Mary I and <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/elizabeth-monarchy/sir-thomas-gresham-to-elizabeth-i/\" title=\"\">Elizabeth I</a>. By the close of his service, he had transformed contemporary understanding of royal power and economics by establishing more convincingly than any of his contemporaries the principle that bankers and money markets could hold monarchs to ransom, and secured a reputation as the great \u2013 and often greatly resented \u2013 fiscal wizard of the age.</p> <p>While addressing himself to these activities, Gresham founded (between 1565 and 1571) the Royal Exchange and dedicated himself to living as disreputable a life as possible. In addition to setting up an unlicensed forge and advocating the death penalty as a way to enforce state-controlled trading monopolies, he was controlling, vain, infatuated by money, and a prodigy of deception, \u201cblatant cronyism\u201d, \u201cbrute force\u201d and \u201cblackmail\u201d. \u201cRuthless, obsessive\u201d and \u201cseemingly loveless\u201d, he repeatedly stiffed family members in financial matters, twice betrayed his wife (whom he married for money) by sleeping with other women, and at his death, for all his fabled wealth, left his widow to deal with an unconscionable level of debt and a bewildering array of duped and angry creditors. Small wonder the father of his future son-in-law saw fit to refer to him as \u201can ill-dealer\u201d.</p> <p>Guy\u2019s handling of this story offers an often vivid picture of the private world in which Gresham moved. But it is difficult not to feel that, when it comes to discussing Gresham\u2019s career, he is thwarted by the aridity of his subject\u2019s profession, as when he (almost comically) alerts us to the revelation that Gresham\u2019s journal is (steady yourself) \u201cthe earliest example from anywhere in the British Isles of double-entry book-keeping\u201d. Equally difficult to ignore is the relentlessly cliched texture of Guy\u2019s prose: \u201cThe fact that she received his letter in stony silence should have sounded alarm bells\u201d; \u201che was exhilarated by the sheer cut and thrust of the markets. He had his finger on their pulse\u201d.</p> <p>This is a pity, for within the onslaught of infelicities the patient reader will find much in these pages that overturns our prevailing assumptions about the true nature and significance of a man the Victorians sought to sanctify. Viewed this way, Gresham emerges not as a figure of honour and integrity, a self-starting hero, a holy benefactor or an uncomplicated patriot, but as an individual whose many private shortcomings both compromised and contributed to \u2013 perhaps even made possible \u2013 the achievements that would characterise his extraordinary public station.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Gresham\u2019s Law: The Life and World of Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s Banker</em> by John Guy is published by Profile (\u00a325).

It is an enterprise from which he does not emerge well. Far from being the self-made man of 19th-century hagiography, Gresham was born to Audrey Lynne and the wealthy and well-connected merchant Sir Richard Gresham at Cheapside in (we think) 1519. Thereafter he was not, as certain Victorian scholars suggested, abandoned in a field only to be discovered by a passerby whose attention was roused by the chirping of a grasshopper, but raised by his father and stepmother, Isabel Worsopp, who entered the family home following the death of his mother in 1522. He received his education first at the Mercers\u2019 Company \u201calphabet\u201d school, followed by St Paul\u2019s and Gonville Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated at the age of 11. With his formal education complete, Gresham was introduced by his father to the tenebrous financial secrets of international exchange. He would go on, all the while beetling between the financial centres of London and Antwerp, to make a living initially in the employ of the Mercers\u2019 Company, before becoming government banker to Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. By the close of his service, he had transformed contemporary understanding of royal power and economics by establishing more convincingly than any of his contemporaries the principle that bankers and money markets could hold monarchs to ransom, and secured a reputation as the great \u2013 and often greatly resented \u2013 fiscal wizard of the age. While addressing himself to these activities, Gresham founded (between 1565 and 1571) the Royal Exchange and dedicated himself to living as disreputable a life as possible. In addition to setting up an unlicensed forge and advocating the death penalty as a way to enforce state-controlled trading monopolies, he was controlling, vain, infatuated by money, and a prodigy of deception, \u201cblatant cronyism\u201d, \u201cbrute force\u201d and \u201cblackmail\u201d. \u201cRuthless, obsessive\u201d and \u201cseemingly loveless\u201d, he repeatedly stiffed family members in financial matters, twice betrayed his wife (whom he married for money) by sleeping with other women, and at his death, for all his fabled wealth, left his widow to deal with an unconscionable level of debt and a bewildering array of duped and angry creditors. Small wonder the father of his future son-in-law saw fit to refer to him as \u201can ill-dealer\u201d. Guy\u2019s handling of this story offers an often vivid picture of the private world in which Gresham moved. But it is difficult not to feel that, when it comes to discussing Gresham\u2019s career, he is thwarted by the aridity of his subject\u2019s profession, as when he (almost comically) alerts us to the revelation that Gresham\u2019s journal is (steady yourself) \u201cthe earliest example from anywhere in the British Isles of double-entry book-keeping\u201d. Equally difficult to ignore is the relentlessly cliched texture of Guy\u2019s prose: \u201cThe fact that she received his letter in stony silence should have sounded alarm bells\u201d; \u201che was exhilarated by the sheer cut and thrust of the markets. He had his finger on their pulse\u201d. This is a pity, for within the onslaught of infelicities the patient reader will find much in these pages that overturns our prevailing assumptions about the true nature and significance of a man the Victorians sought to sanctify. Viewed this way, Gresham emerges not as a figure of honour and integrity, a self-starting hero, a holy benefactor or an uncomplicated patriot, but as an individual whose many private shortcomings both compromised and contributed to \u2013 perhaps even made possible \u2013 the achievements that would characterise his extraordinary public station. \u2022 Gresham\u2019s Law: The Life and World of Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s Banker by John Guy is published by Profile (\u00a325).

      "body": "<p>In November 2016, the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, renowned for his plaintive ballads, died a few months after the woman who inspired many of them, his Norwegian lover and muse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/so-long-marianne-leonard-cohen-writes-to-muse-just-before-her-death\" title=\"\">Marianne </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/so-long-marianne-leonard-cohen-writes-to-muse-just-before-her-death\" title=\"\">Ihlen</a>. Theirs had been a large and chaotic romance that was in many respects a product of the particular times (the 1960s) and the specific place (the Greek island of Hydra) in which they met. The relationship\u2019s legacy was a catalogue of classic songs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZI6EdnvH-8\" title=\"\">So Long Marianne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-bJPmasXKs\" title=\"\">Hey, That\u2019s No Way to Say Goodbye</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmPUu-rMpWA\" title=\"\">Bird on </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmPUu-rMpWA\" title=\"\">the Wire</a> \u2013 a great deal of heartache, but also a lasting sense of the creative power of love.</p> <p>All of this the documentary maker Nick Broomfield explores in his tender, funny and hauntingly moving new film <em>Marianne and Leonard: Words of Love</em>. Broomfield is not a disinterested observer. He knew Ihlen well. They too were lovers for a while during one of the long breaks in Ihlen\u2019s relationship with Cohen. And her effect on the film-maker was almost as influential as her part in the Canadian poet-musician\u2019s career.</p> <p>In 1968, when Broomfield was 20, he\u2019d just finished his first year at Cardiff University, where he was reading law. His heart was not really in becoming a barrister and, on a Hellenic cruise with his parents, Rosalind Runcie, the wife of the future archbishop of Canterbury, gave him some advice. \u201cShe was the life and soul of the party,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand she made me promise to go to Hydra when I got off the boat.\u201d</p> <p>He kept the promise and encountered a captivating new world. \u201cThere was this incredible community of artists and painters and a whole very wild attitude to life,\u201d he says in his trademark languorous drawl, located somewhere between the home counties and southern California.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"211a76d2b9c3dfda0407371fce8adc1c6813ad8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211a76d2b9c3dfda0407371fce8adc1c6813ad8b/0_0_5497_3537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonard Cohen (holding the guitar) with Marianne (looking at him) and friends in Hydra, Greece, October 1960\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leonard Cohen (holding the guitar) with Marianne (looking at him) and friends in Hydra, Greece, October 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Burke/The Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the heart of this liberating idyll was a beautiful woman 13 years his senior, the mother of an eight-year-old boy. Marianne Ihlen had first come to Hydra in early 1958, when the living conditions were primitive and the expat artists could be counted on one hand. She was with a young, avant-garde Norwegian novelist called Axel Jensen. The couple had a tempestuous relationship, with the writer determined to reject bourgeois conventions in ways that conveniently coincided with his interest in other women. It was a common preoccupation among the expat community and not always restricted to the men. After one long split, Jensen and Ihlen got back together, married and had a baby (Axel Jnr), only for Jensen to meet another woman and leave shortly after the child was born. Ihlen felt lost and abandoned, but reluctant to return home.</p> <p>Around that time, in the spring of 1960, a handsome, chivalrously polite Canadian poet joined the growing Hydra artistic community. He had fled the grey and damp of London to work on his first novel. In the film, the magical sense of possibility this brightly coloured jewel of the Saronic Gulf offered up to visitors is captured in glittering footage from the period.</p> <p>As Cohen later recalled: \u201cIt was as if everyone was young and beautiful and full of talent \u2013 covered with a kind of gold dust. Everybody had special and unique qualities. This is, of course, the feeling of youth, but in the glorious setting of Hydra, all these qualities were magnified.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsRNV1cJ-jA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EsRNV1cJ-jA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsRNV1cJ-jA\">Watch a trailer for Marianne &amp; Leonard: Words of Love</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It wasn\u2019t long before Cohen and Marianne began seeing each other, first as friends and then romantically. This infancy of their affair was blissfully untroubled by the external world. Cohen was disciplined in his work. Rising early, he would sit on the terrace in the sun and religiously bash out his three pages a day on an old typewriter. In the evening, he played his guitar and sang lullabies to Ihlen\u2019s little boy. At that time, he had no thought of becoming a musician.</p> <p>Ihlen, still only just 25, was deeply in love. She sent her son back to Norway to live with his grandmother, then moved in with Cohen who, on turning 26, bought himself a house on Hydra. But, pretty and alluring as the island was, it required labour to live there. Even getting drinking water was an effort. Ihlen took care of Cohen, as he in turn provided for her. Without making any conscious decision, she effectively became his muse.</p> <p>By today\u2019s standards of gender equality, and the #MeToo awareness of male abuse of power, the very idea of a muse seems a dubious anachronism. Broomfield is alive to changing mores but feels it would be wrong to \u201cjudge the past by today\u2019s morality\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose being a muse feels like an 18th-century concept because it\u2019s not monetised,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think Leonard always gave her the credit that was her due.\u201d</p> <p>He draws a comparison with the record producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rick-rubin\" title=\"\">Rick Rubin</a>, who tries to become close friends with the artists he produces before reinventing them by fostering a particular quality he\u2019s identified. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of what Marianne did. She was somebody who had this incredible instinct to know the strength of people.\u201d</p> <p>It was out of a desire to rebalance the image of the couple, he says, that he put Ihlen\u2019s name first in the title. Nonetheless, the film also picks up on her discomfort at her role as facilitator rather than creator.</p> <p>Helle Goldman, the translator of Ihlen\u2019s biography, <em>So Long Marianne</em>, grew up on Hydra and her parents knew Cohen and Ihlen. She mentions an anecdote from the film. Ihlen recalled that, on being introduced to a group of artists and not knowing how to describe what she did, she said that her life was her art.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a silly thing to say, but the fact that she was from a very early age defined as a male artist\u2019s muse did handicap her for a while,\u201d says Goldman. \u201cYet she enjoyed creating a pleasant home, tending to her loved ones, cooking and so forth. Leonard remarked on how appealing this was.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"584f6f7755158e31e92378e7e29553929df8625a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/584f6f7755158e31e92378e7e29553929df8625a/0_0_5297_3532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marianne, left, with her baby  son, Axel Jensen Jr, with Cohen (second left) and friends, Hydra, 1960.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marianne, left, with her baby son, Axel Jensen Jr, with Cohen (second left) and friends, Hydra, 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Burke/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cohen used to wish for a matriarchy, though not necessarily in his own private life. Goldman doesn\u2019t believe that Ihlen ever saw her situation through any kind of feminist lens. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a sexist issue, but a human one, of how to define herself.\u201d</p> <p>One definition that weighed on her was that of single mother. Ihlen had to return to Norway and her son, while Cohen needed to get back to Canada to earn some money. They drove to Norway together, then the aspiring novelist flew to Montreal. It was the first of many estrangements to come. This was a time, of course, when phones were a rarity and communication was by handwritten letters. That sweet agony of separation, intolerable yet full of poetic longing, is one that is unimaginable in the age of text and Snapchat.</p> <p>In the film, there is footage of Cohen in concert, introducing a song by talking about his relationship with Marianne. At first, he says, he lived with her for most of the year, then two months, then two weeks, until, he says in a wry delivery, he lives with her two days a year. It\u2019s delivered with warmth and irony, but it also speaks of a painful truth.</p> <p>There were stints together on Hydra, in Montreal and, most unhappily, in New York. For the next decade, Cohen came and went. Two long stays on Hydra produced two novels, <em>The Favourite Game</em> and <em>Beautiful Losers</em>, a strange, mystical fiction I recall reading as a hungry-for-experience teenager travelling around the Greek islands. Cohen had a breakdown when it was completed and, realising that he would never fully support himself, let alone anyone else, by writing literature, he turned his attentions to music. In 1966, Judy Collins recorded a song Cohen played her called Suzanne, along with the much later Hallelujah, his best-known hit. Thereafter, he took up songwriting, recording and performing and became an international star.</p> <p>To be a tortured singer-songwriter in the mid-1960s with Cohen\u2019s saturnine good looks and quietly penetrating personality was not a set of circumstances to advance the cause of fidelity. Joni Mitchell once called Cohen a \u201cboudoir poet\u201d and for all his manners and sensitivity, he was incapable of turning down the wealth of opportunities that came his way. That a later album, produced by a demented Phil Spector, was entitled <em>Death of a Ladies\u2019 Man</em> was not entirely ironic.</p> <p>There is a revealing scene in the film in which a stunningly beautiful young woman comes on to him, seemingly in the company of her boyfriend. It\u2019s all Cohen can do not to seduce her in front of the watching cameras. As Goldman comments: \u201cHe was quite a womaniser. He was very romantic and also I guess really horny. That\u2019s an interesting combination.\u201d</p> <p>It was around this time that the young Broomfield turned up in Hydra. The incursion is subtly handled in the film, with the Englishman deliberately minimising his part so as not to distract from the romance at the centre of the film. Initially, he wrote himself out of the narrative, but it\u2019s an interlude that deserves its place in the story. He was smitten by Ihlen and she followed him back to England, then came to visit him at university in Cardiff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ced62a12e6a0a7b41db50d62367a31ff22f0ee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ced62a12e6a0a7b41db50d62367a31ff22f0ee2/0_0_4124_5774/714.jpg\" alt=\"Film-maker Nick Broomfield.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Film-maker Nick Broomfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik Tanner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was a big age gap between us,\u201d he says. \u201cI was really out of my depth. It was quite hard for me to embrace this enormous world. She was very close to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/19/julie-felix-80-birthday-interview-beatnik-folk-star-leonard-cohen\" title=\"\">Julie Felix</a>, whom she encouraged as a songwriter and who was on <em>The Frost Report </em>and friends with David Frost.\u201d</p> <p>A year earlier, on Hydra, Ihlen had met the great documentary-maker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/06/da-pennebaker-chris-hegedus-filmmaker-cat\" title=\"\">DA Pennebaker</a>, who made the classic film of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1965 English concert tour <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/17/dont-look-back-bob-dylan-invention-rockumentary\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t Look Back</a></em>, and she suggested that Broomfield should consider film-making. \u201cShe just showed me this world of possibilities that I\u2019d never even imagined,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Remarkably, Pennebaker\u2019s son managed to dig out the film he shot on Hydra in 1967 and send it to Broomfield during the editing process. It shows Marianne at 32, an attractive and proud woman who carried no air of entitlement.</p> <p>She and Broomfield were together for almost a year. He says she was instrumental in pushing him to make his first film, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxr2tEGlWUE&amp;has_verified=1\" title=\"\">Who Cares?</a></em>, in 1971, about slum clearance. He has since made more than 30 films, winning countless awards. Among them have been several first-rate films about musicians, although for my money <em>Marianne and Leonard</em> is the best of these.</p> <p>Broomfield, whom I\u2019ve known for a couple of decades, says Ihlen remained in love with Cohen. At the end of their year together, she went to New York to try to restart the relationship with him. Cohen was living at the famously louche Chelsea hotel in Manhattan and hanging out with people such as Janis Joplin (about whom he wrote Chelsea Hotel), Joni Mitchell and Nico from the Velvet Underground. With her son, Marianne moved into a run-down apartment in Clinton Street. One night, she was mugged on the doorstep. Cohen kept her at a distance, informing her that the Chelsea hotel wasn\u2019t \u201cher scene\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was a very harrowing experience for her,\u201d says Broomfield.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Few of those who gathered on Hydra emerged with their art\u00a0enhanced or lives more sorted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It marked the end of the affair and equally, as the 1960s came to a close, the end of an era. The shining promise that Hydra represented at the beginning of that decade gradually darkened until Ihlen\u2019s great love seemed to disappear into a fug of dissolution in downtown New York. As Cohen used to say: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve lived on Hydra, you can\u2019t live anywhere else, including Hydra.\u201d</p> <p>A generation of artists had set out in search of themselves, a journey that, in Ihlen\u2019s case, took in Jungian psychology, the I Ching, LSD and various other fads. Following Cohen\u2019s lead, she also dabbled in Scientology. As Broomfield shows in his film, very few of those who gathered on Hydra emerged with either their art enhanced or their lives more sorted. Divorce, suicide and madness were some of the endings that the journey had in store. The self, it turned out, could be selfish and destructive.</p> <p>While paying tribute to its beauty and simplicity, Broomfield says that Hydra was \u201ca very tough island\u201d that, for artists, required \u201can iron will\u201d to succeed or else the lure of cheap alcohol and ready affairs would prove too great. Cohen had that will. It was the success that his efforts brought him that did for his romance with Ihlen.</p> <p>There were other factors too. According to Broomfield, who met Cohen several times, the singer wanted to have Jewish children, something that Ihlen accepted, though he thinks it was an enormous disappointment to her that they didn\u2019t have a child. But, he says, she \u201cwasn\u2019t someone to feel sorry for herself\u201d.</p> <p>Indeed, while her experience in New York left a bitter taste, Ihlen said later of her time with Cohen: \u201cThis relationship was a gift to me. And a gift for Leonard, I might also add, not to underestimate myself completely.\u201d</p> <p>The person who most struggled with the dislocation and uncertainty that their life together brought was Ihlen\u2019s son, Axel Jnr. He was sent to board at Summerhill, the experimental school in Suffolk. There were other children of Hydra expats there, and, in keeping with the wisdom of the times, Ihlen believed that its unstructured regime, where lessons were optional, would suit her son. In fact he was unmoored and desperate for his mother. As he grew older, he developed psychiatric problems and has subsequently spent a large part of his life in and out of institutions. Ihlen would look back on Summerhill and the periods that her son spent in Norway without her with deep regret.</p> <p>Goldman believes that if Axel\u2019s difficulties were environmental, they probably had more to do with Hydra: \u201cYou have to understand that the kids that stayed on the island became very messed up later. I know some of them. It did not turn out well for them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95ff5ff96246fb30a15e6c9ebb88a41cd4024c8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95ff5ff96246fb30a15e6c9ebb88a41cd4024c8d/0_0_841_1024/821.jpg\" alt=\"A letter from Cohen to Ihlen.\" width=\"821\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A letter from Cohen to Ihlen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christies New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Ihlen retained a connection to Hydra, returning each year, her residency came to an abrupt end in 1972 when a young woman carrying a baby knocked on the door of the house she had shared with Cohen. She asked Ihlen when she would be moving out. This was Suzanne Elrod, who, depending on which account you believe, met Cohen in the Chelsea hotel lift or at a Scientology meeting in 1969. In any case, they had two children together before splitting up, acrimoniously, in 1978.</p> <p>Cohen would go on to discover Zen Buddhism and live for several years in a retreat, lose all his money to a manager he trusted, and make a fortune late in life touring the world. He continued to send money to Ihlen and her son long after they broke up. He was particularly concerned about Axel, to whom he\u2019d been close, and spoke to Broomfield about the boy when they met up.</p> <p>Ihlen returned to Norway to live and found employment working in a secretarial capacity for a company building oil platforms. It was about as far from being a folk singer\u2019s muse as it\u2019s possible to conceive. She married an engineer with three daughters from a previous marriage and they remained together, though in separate apartments in the same building, until she died.</p> <p>Just before her death in July 2016 of leukaemia, a friend of hers, Jan Christian Mollestad, contacted Cohen, who sent an email to his former lover, which Mollestad read out to Ihlen. It said:</p> <p>Dearest Marianne,</p> <p>I\u2019m just a little behind you, close enough to take your hand. This old body has given up, just as yours has too, and the eviction notice is on its way any day now.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten your love and your beauty. But you know that. I don\u2019t have to say any more. Safe travels old friend. See you down the road. Love and gratitude. Leonard</p> <p>Four months later, Cohen died after a fall at his home in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Owing to a radio interview with Mollestad, in which he paraphrased the deathbed message at longer length, a different version of the email was initially reported. It was hailed as a romantic classic of eternal love. The real version is a little more economical but no less touching. Earlier this month, a cache of more than 50 love letters between Ihlen and Cohen sold for $870,000 at auction \u2013 the money will help secure Axel Jnr\u2019s future.</p> <p>The scene of Ihlen hearing the letter read out is shown in Broomfield\u2019s film. It\u2019s clear that, as she confronts death with grace and humour, the words are a kind of completion, mortality\u2019s ultimate balm.</p> <p>There have been many thousands of travellers who have fallen in love on the Greek islands since Ihlen and Cohen first met. The shimmering Mediterranean gently lapping at the sun-bleached shore of a gorgeous fishing village: it\u2019s a scene that creates a timeless sense of the world in which feelings, intensified by the heat and light, can seem as if they will last for ever. Most often, they burn out and remain only as embers in the memory. But with Marianne and Leonard they had a long and meaningful afterlife in their own thoughts, in his songs and now in Broomfield\u2019s richly poignant elegy.</p> <p><em>Marianne &amp; Leonard: Words of Love is released on 26 July</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In November 2016, the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, renowned for his plaintive ballads, died a few months after the woman who inspired many of them, his Norwegian lover and muse, Marianne Ihlen. Theirs had been a large and chaotic romance that was in many respects a product of the particular times (the 1960s) and the specific place (the Greek island of Hydra) in which they met. The relationship\u2019s legacy was a catalogue of classic songs \u2013 So Long Marianne, Hey, That\u2019s No Way to Say Goodbye, Bird on the Wire \u2013 a great deal of heartache, but also a lasting sense of the creative power of love. All of this the documentary maker Nick Broomfield explores in his tender, funny and hauntingly moving new film Marianne and Leonard: Words of Love. Broomfield is not a disinterested observer. He knew Ihlen well. They too were lovers for a while during one of the long breaks in Ihlen\u2019s relationship with Cohen. And her effect on the film-maker was almost as influential as her part in the Canadian poet-musician\u2019s career. In 1968, when Broomfield was 20, he\u2019d just finished his first year at Cardiff University, where he was reading law. His heart was not really in becoming a barrister and, on a Hellenic cruise with his parents, Rosalind Runcie, the wife of the future archbishop of Canterbury, gave him some advice. \u201cShe was the life and soul of the party,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand she made me promise to go to Hydra when I got off the boat.\u201d He kept the promise and encountered a captivating new world. \u201cThere was this incredible community of artists and painters and a whole very wild attitude to life,\u201d he says in his trademark languorous drawl, located somewhere between the home counties and southern California. At the heart of this liberating idyll was a beautiful woman 13 years his senior, the mother of an eight-year-old boy. Marianne Ihlen had first come to Hydra in early 1958, when the living conditions were primitive and the expat artists could be counted on one hand. She was with a young, avant-garde Norwegian novelist called Axel Jensen. The couple had a tempestuous relationship, with the writer determined to reject bourgeois conventions in ways that conveniently coincided with his interest in other women. It was a common preoccupation among the expat community and not always restricted to the men. After one long split, Jensen and Ihlen got back together, married and had a baby (Axel Jnr), only for Jensen to meet another woman and leave shortly after the child was born. Ihlen felt lost and abandoned, but reluctant to return home. Around that time, in the spring of 1960, a handsome, chivalrously polite Canadian poet joined the growing Hydra artistic community. He had fled the grey and damp of London to work on his first novel. In the film, the magical sense of possibility this brightly coloured jewel of the Saronic Gulf offered up to visitors is captured in glittering footage from the period. As Cohen later recalled: \u201cIt was as if everyone was young and beautiful and full of talent \u2013 covered with a kind of gold dust. Everybody had special and unique qualities. This is, of course, the feeling of youth, but in the glorious setting of Hydra, all these qualities were magnified.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before Cohen and Marianne began seeing each other, first as friends and then romantically. This infancy of their affair was blissfully untroubled by the external world. Cohen was disciplined in his work. Rising early, he would sit on the terrace in the sun and religiously bash out his three pages a day on an old typewriter. In the evening, he played his guitar and sang lullabies to Ihlen\u2019s little boy. At that time, he had no thought of becoming a musician. Ihlen, still only just 25, was deeply in love. She sent her son back to Norway to live with his grandmother, then moved in with Cohen who, on turning 26, bought himself a house on Hydra. But, pretty and alluring as the island was, it required labour to live there. Even getting drinking water was an effort. Ihlen took care of Cohen, as he in turn provided for her. Without making any conscious decision, she effectively became his muse. By today\u2019s standards of gender equality, and the #MeToo awareness of male abuse of power, the very idea of a muse seems a dubious anachronism. Broomfield is alive to changing mores but feels it would be wrong to \u201cjudge the past by today\u2019s morality\u201d. \u201cI suppose being a muse feels like an 18th-century concept because it\u2019s not monetised,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think Leonard always gave her the credit that was her due.\u201d He draws a comparison with the record producer Rick Rubin, who tries to become close friends with the artists he produces before reinventing them by fostering a particular quality he\u2019s identified. \u201cI think that\u2019s kind of what Marianne did. She was somebody who had this incredible instinct to know the strength of people.\u201d It was out of a desire to rebalance the image of the couple, he says, that he put Ihlen\u2019s name first in the title. Nonetheless, the film also picks up on her discomfort at her role as facilitator rather than creator. Helle Goldman, the translator of Ihlen\u2019s biography, So Long Marianne, grew up on Hydra and her parents knew Cohen and Ihlen. She mentions an anecdote from the film. Ihlen recalled that, on being introduced to a group of artists and not knowing how to describe what she did, she said that her life was her art. \u201cIt\u2019s a silly thing to say, but the fact that she was from a very early age defined as a male artist\u2019s muse did handicap her for a while,\u201d says Goldman. \u201cYet she enjoyed creating a pleasant home, tending to her loved ones, cooking and so forth. Leonard remarked on how appealing this was.\u201d Cohen used to wish for a matriarchy, though not necessarily in his own private life. Goldman doesn\u2019t believe that Ihlen ever saw her situation through any kind of feminist lens. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a sexist issue, but a human one, of how to define herself.\u201d One definition that weighed on her was that of single mother. Ihlen had to return to Norway and her son, while Cohen needed to get back to Canada to earn some money. They drove to Norway together, then the aspiring novelist flew to Montreal. It was the first of many estrangements to come. This was a time, of course, when phones were a rarity and communication was by handwritten letters. That sweet agony of separation, intolerable yet full of poetic longing, is one that is unimaginable in the age of text and Snapchat. In the film, there is footage of Cohen in concert, introducing a song by talking about his relationship with Marianne. At first, he says, he lived with her for most of the year, then two months, then two weeks, until, he says in a wry delivery, he lives with her two days a year. It\u2019s delivered with warmth and irony, but it also speaks of a painful truth. There were stints together on Hydra, in Montreal and, most unhappily, in New York. For the next decade, Cohen came and went. Two long stays on Hydra produced two novels, The Favourite Game and Beautiful Losers, a strange, mystical fiction I recall reading as a hungry-for-experience teenager travelling around the Greek islands. Cohen had a breakdown when it was completed and, realising that he would never fully support himself, let alone anyone else, by writing literature, he turned his attentions to music. In 1966, Judy Collins recorded a song Cohen played her called Suzanne, along with the much later Hallelujah, his best-known hit. Thereafter, he took up songwriting, recording and performing and became an international star. To be a tortured singer-songwriter in the mid-1960s with Cohen\u2019s saturnine good looks and quietly penetrating personality was not a set of circumstances to advance the cause of fidelity. Joni Mitchell once called Cohen a \u201cboudoir poet\u201d and for all his manners and sensitivity, he was incapable of turning down the wealth of opportunities that came his way. That a later album, produced by a demented Phil Spector, was entitled Death of a Ladies\u2019 Man was not entirely ironic. There is a revealing scene in the film in which a stunningly beautiful young woman comes on to him, seemingly in the company of her boyfriend. It\u2019s all Cohen can do not to seduce her in front of the watching cameras. As Goldman comments: \u201cHe was quite a womaniser. He was very romantic and also I guess really horny. That\u2019s an interesting combination.\u201d It was around this time that the young Broomfield turned up in Hydra. The incursion is subtly handled in the film, with the Englishman deliberately minimising his part so as not to distract from the romance at the centre of the film. Initially, he wrote himself out of the narrative, but it\u2019s an interlude that deserves its place in the story. He was smitten by Ihlen and she followed him back to England, then came to visit him at university in Cardiff. \u201cThere was a big age gap between us,\u201d he says. \u201cI was really out of my depth. It was quite hard for me to embrace this enormous world. She was very close to Julie Felix, whom she encouraged as a songwriter and who was on The Frost Report and friends with David Frost.\u201d A year earlier, on Hydra, Ihlen had met the great documentary-maker DA Pennebaker, who made the classic film of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1965 English concert tour Don\u2019t Look Back, and she suggested that Broomfield should consider film-making. \u201cShe just showed me this world of possibilities that I\u2019d never even imagined,\u201d he says. Remarkably, Pennebaker\u2019s son managed to dig out the film he shot on Hydra in 1967 and send it to Broomfield during the editing process. It shows Marianne at 32, an attractive and proud woman who carried no air of entitlement. She and Broomfield were together for almost a year. He says she was instrumental in pushing him to make his first film, Who Cares?, in 1971, about slum clearance. He has since made more than 30 films, winning countless awards. Among them have been several first-rate films about musicians, although for my money Marianne and Leonard is the best of these. Broomfield, whom I\u2019ve known for a couple of decades, says Ihlen remained in love with Cohen. At the end of their year together, she went to New York to try to restart the relationship with him. Cohen was living at the famously louche Chelsea hotel in Manhattan and hanging out with people such as Janis Joplin (about whom he wrote Chelsea Hotel), Joni Mitchell and Nico from the Velvet Underground. With her son, Marianne moved into a run-down apartment in Clinton Street. One night, she was mugged on the doorstep. Cohen kept her at a distance, informing her that the Chelsea hotel wasn\u2019t \u201cher scene\u201d. \u201cI think it was a very harrowing experience for her,\u201d says Broomfield. It marked the end of the affair and equally, as the 1960s came to a close, the end of an era. The shining promise that Hydra represented at the beginning of that decade gradually darkened until Ihlen\u2019s great love seemed to disappear into a fug of dissolution in downtown New York. As Cohen used to say: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve lived on Hydra, you can\u2019t live anywhere else, including Hydra.\u201d A generation of artists had set out in search of themselves, a journey that, in Ihlen\u2019s case, took in Jungian psychology, the I Ching, LSD and various other fads. Following Cohen\u2019s lead, she also dabbled in Scientology. As Broomfield shows in his film, very few of those who gathered on Hydra emerged with either their art enhanced or their lives more sorted. Divorce, suicide and madness were some of the endings that the journey had in store. The self, it turned out, could be selfish and destructive. While paying tribute to its beauty and simplicity, Broomfield says that Hydra was \u201ca very tough island\u201d that, for artists, required \u201can iron will\u201d to succeed or else the lure of cheap alcohol and ready affairs would prove too great. Cohen had that will. It was the success that his efforts brought him that did for his romance with Ihlen. There were other factors too. According to Broomfield, who met Cohen several times, the singer wanted to have Jewish children, something that Ihlen accepted, though he thinks it was an enormous disappointment to her that they didn\u2019t have a child. But, he says, she \u201cwasn\u2019t someone to feel sorry for herself\u201d. Indeed, while her experience in New York left a bitter taste, Ihlen said later of her time with Cohen: \u201cThis relationship was a gift to me. And a gift for Leonard, I might also add, not to underestimate myself completely.\u201d The person who most struggled with the dislocation and uncertainty that their life together brought was Ihlen\u2019s son, Axel Jnr. He was sent to board at Summerhill, the experimental school in Suffolk. There were other children of Hydra expats there, and, in keeping with the wisdom of the times, Ihlen believed that its unstructured regime, where lessons were optional, would suit her son. In fact he was unmoored and desperate for his mother. As he grew older, he developed psychiatric problems and has subsequently spent a large part of his life in and out of institutions. Ihlen would look back on Summerhill and the periods that her son spent in Norway without her with deep regret. Goldman believes that if Axel\u2019s difficulties were environmental, they probably had more to do with Hydra: \u201cYou have to understand that the kids that stayed on the island became very messed up later. I know some of them. It did not turn out well for them.\u201d Though Ihlen retained a connection to Hydra, returning each year, her residency came to an abrupt end in 1972 when a young woman carrying a baby knocked on the door of the house she had shared with Cohen. She asked Ihlen when she would be moving out. This was Suzanne Elrod, who, depending on which account you believe, met Cohen in the Chelsea hotel lift or at a Scientology meeting in 1969. In any case, they had two children together before splitting up, acrimoniously, in 1978. Cohen would go on to discover Zen Buddhism and live for several years in a retreat, lose all his money to a manager he trusted, and make a fortune late in life touring the world. He continued to send money to Ihlen and her son long after they broke up. He was particularly concerned about Axel, to whom he\u2019d been close, and spoke to Broomfield about the boy when they met up. Ihlen returned to Norway to live and found employment working in a secretarial capacity for a company building oil platforms. It was about as far from being a folk singer\u2019s muse as it\u2019s possible to conceive. She married an engineer with three daughters from a previous marriage and they remained together, though in separate apartments in the same building, until she died. Just before her death in July 2016 of leukaemia, a friend of hers, Jan Christian Mollestad, contacted Cohen, who sent an email to his former lover, which Mollestad read out to Ihlen. It said: Dearest Marianne, I\u2019m just a little behind you, close enough to take your hand. This old body has given up, just as yours has too, and the eviction notice is on its way any day now. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten your love and your beauty. But you know that. I don\u2019t have to say any more. Safe travels old friend. See you down the road. Love and gratitude. Leonard Four months later, Cohen died after a fall at his home in Los Angeles. Owing to a radio interview with Mollestad, in which he paraphrased the deathbed message at longer length, a different version of the email was initially reported. It was hailed as a romantic classic of eternal love. The real version is a little more economical but no less touching. Earlier this month, a cache of more than 50 love letters between Ihlen and Cohen sold for $870,000 at auction \u2013 the money will help secure Axel Jnr\u2019s future. The scene of Ihlen hearing the letter read out is shown in Broomfield\u2019s film. It\u2019s clear that, as she confronts death with grace and humour, the words are a kind of completion, mortality\u2019s ultimate balm. There have been many thousands of travellers who have fallen in love on the Greek islands since Ihlen and Cohen first met. The shimmering Mediterranean gently lapping at the sun-bleached shore of a gorgeous fishing village: it\u2019s a scene that creates a timeless sense of the world in which feelings, intensified by the heat and light, can seem as if they will last for ever. Most often, they burn out and remain only as embers in the memory. But with Marianne and Leonard they had a long and meaningful afterlife in their own thoughts, in his songs and now in Broomfield\u2019s richly poignant elegy.

Mental health and psychosocial support should be available to all people in conflict and post-conflict situations. Neglecting people\u2019s mental suffering \u2013 staying silent \u2013 is not an option. If we truly want to help a country with reconstruction, we shouldn\u2019t just rebuild the bombed bridges. We should also help people repair their broken souls. Humanitarian organisations are doing what they can. Survival of the body, not the soul, is their first concern. That\u2019s understandable, but it\u2019s only half of the solution. Access to mental healthcare is a human right. This is already the case in theory. But it should also be happening in practice. The good news: there are already many initiatives. But they are too dispersed and isolated to be effective. That is why I am campaigning for greater focus on psychosocial support. I will do so in concert with partners such as the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, the WHO and the International Red Cross. And I will urge my counterparts from other countries to act, too. In October, I will also host an international conference on the subject in Amsterdam. I want everyone to understand the devastating long-term effects of mental suffering. Mental healthcare must be recognised as a basic need. And it should be made structurally available. Now is the time to act. Investing in mental wellbeing is an investment in prevention, in reconstruction and in human dignity. It\u2019s an investment in people, in a stable foundation, in the future. We should all work together on this. Mental health was neglected in Rwanda 25 years ago. We must ensure we do everything we can to tackle it in today\u2019s conflicts.

      "body": "<p>David Lynch is best known for his strange, beguiling, often nightmarish work for cinema and television \u2013 films such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/interactive/2013/aug/24/philip-french-blue-velvet-review\" title=\"\">Blue Velvet</a></em> and <em>Mulholland Drive</em> and the TV phenomenon <em>Twin Peaks</em> \u2013 but from his home studio in the Hollywood Hills he also produces music, paintings, sculptures, books, short films and music videos. The breadth of Lynch\u2019s creative interests will be on full display this week at the <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/david-lynch-at-home/\" title=\"\">Manchester </a><a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/david-lynch-at-home/\" title=\"\">international </a><a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/david-lynch-at-home/\" title=\"\">festival</a>, where the 73-year-old presents a special season of screenings, live music and talks at the city\u2019s Home arts centre, alongside his first major UK exhibition of visual art.</p> <p>Lynch was born in Montana and grew up in various parts of the white-picket-fence middle America he would later interrogate in his films. He studied painting in Philadelphia before making a transition to experimental cinema. His 1977 debut, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/22/david-lynch-eraserhead\" title=\"\">Eraserhead</a></em>, became a cult classic and paved the way for <em>The Elephant Man</em>, which was nominated for eight Oscars, and a big-budget adaptation of <em>Dune</em>, a painful flop on its release in 1984. Over time Lynch\u2019s films have become increasingly oblique, culminating in the fractured fever dream of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/mar/11/features.review77\" title=\"\">Inland Empire </a></em>(2006), though his 1999 road movie, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/dec/05/davidlynch.philipfrench\" title=\"\">The Straight Story</a></em>, was unexpectedly linear and tender-hearted, steering clear of the violence and depravity that marks much of his work.</p> <p>Lynch hasn\u2019t directed a film in 13 years, and it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019ll ever go back to Hollywood, though his 18-episode return to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/sep/06/twin-peaks-was-this-the-long-perfect-goodbye-from-david-lynch\" title=\"\">Twin Peaks</a></em> in 2017 threw up enough mysteries to keep his diehard fans occupied for years to come. On a video link from his Los Angeles home, Lynch \u2013 dressed in a trademark black shirt and full of beans after a morning\u2019s meditation and coffee drinking \u2013 discussed some of the more outlandish responses to <em>Twin Peaks</em>, as well as Brexit, his love of factories, and why the chickens are coming home to roost for America.</p> <p><strong>What should we expect from your season at the Manchester </strong><strong>international </strong><strong>festival?</strong><br>My participation is paintings, drawings, lithographs and some sculpture.

And I deeply love <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> for how it captures the golden age of Hollywood and its fall. It\u2019s just a great Hollywood story.</p> <p><strong>According to the press notes, some of your artworks in the show are inspired by Manchester\u2019s industrial history.</strong><br>I don\u2019t know about that. I went to northern England in the 90s on a search for factories, because I love to photograph factories and I always heard that northern England had the ultimate factories. Even though I\u2019ve never been a factory worker, for some reason I just love the idea of smokestacks, fire, the brick, the narrow streets, the whole factory life. But the trip was very depressing, because when I got up there it was really too late. They were tearing down a smokestack a week and the old factories were disappearing, replaced by pathetic, corrugated metal buildings, with cows in the fields where the factories once were. I guess it\u2019s good for the environment but it\u2019s bad for photography, I\u2019ll tell you that.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve often described creative ideas as fish. Are the fish biting at the moment?</strong><br>Well, as you know if you ever fished, you have to have patience \u2013 some days you catch some, some days you don\u2019t. I am fishing now, and I\u2019m gathering fish together, but I haven\u2019t started cooking them. Right now, I\u2019d say the ideas are in the world of sculpture and painting.</p> <p><strong>Do have everything you need at home to make work, to the point that you don\u2019t really need to leave?</strong><br>I\u2019ve got everything. Though I would like to have a giant soundstage, and much more room for storage and building \u2013 a mini-studio. But now, thanks to the digital world, it\u2019s becoming possible to build an entire world right at your desk.</p> <p><strong>Is that a good thing, even if it means going out into the world less?</strong><br>I don\u2019t like going out anyway. I like to stay at home. Of course I do think it\u2019s important sometimes to go out and see new things and feel the so-called reality. And that can conjure ideas. But I think human beings can sense the air and feel what\u2019s going on in the world without going out. I haven\u2019t been over to England recently, but I can feel this Brexit thing, I can feel the torment. It\u2019s a deeply strange situation. Nobody really thought you\u2019d want to exit [the EU]. It is a terrible disaster. Totally nuts\u2026 And I can feel in the world, there are many, many gigantic problems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ed1696f5afd3beea8c57247ad80b9aa39959d41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ed1696f5afd3beea8c57247ad80b9aa39959d41/0_0_7635_3973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Lynch\u2019s artwork Bob Finds Himself in a World for Which He Has No Understanding (2000).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Lynch\u2019s artwork Bob Finds Himself in a World for Which He Has No Understanding (2000).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you feel that we\u2019re living in particularly dark times?</strong><br>No, I feel we\u2019ve been in very dark times and much better times are coming. The thing is, bad news sells, frightening things sell, sensationalism sells. So we don\u2019t hear all the good news that\u2019s happening, because it seems kind of boring. But I think there are so many good things happening, and people thinking and inventing.

The drugs have ruined so much.</p> <p><strong>Do you see it as your role as an artist and a film-maker to counteract this in some way, to shake people up?</strong><br>Absolutely not, because then you end up making a message film. You see, I get ideas in fragments, and only when a bunch of fragments come together I say: \u201cOh, this is about this, or this could be about this.\u201d But there\u2019s absolutely no message, no steering anyone any which way.

      "bodyText": "David Lynch is best known for his strange, beguiling, often nightmarish work for cinema and television \u2013 films such as Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive and the TV phenomenon Twin Peaks \u2013 but from his home studio in the Hollywood Hills he also produces music, paintings, sculptures, books, short films and music videos. The breadth of Lynch\u2019s creative interests will be on full display this week at the Manchester international festival, where the 73-year-old presents a special season of screenings, live music and talks at the city\u2019s Home arts centre, alongside his first major UK exhibition of visual art. Lynch was born in Montana and grew up in various parts of the white-picket-fence middle America he would later interrogate in his films. He studied painting in Philadelphia before making a transition to experimental cinema. His 1977 debut, Eraserhead, became a cult classic and paved the way for The Elephant Man, which was nominated for eight Oscars, and a big-budget adaptation of Dune, a painful flop on its release in 1984. Over time Lynch\u2019s films have become increasingly oblique, culminating in the fractured fever dream of Inland Empire (2006), though his 1999 road movie, The Straight Story, was unexpectedly linear and tender-hearted, steering clear of the violence and depravity that marks much of his work. Lynch hasn\u2019t directed a film in 13 years, and it\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019ll ever go back to Hollywood, though his 18-episode return to Twin Peaks in 2017 threw up enough mysteries to keep his diehard fans occupied for years to come. On a video link from his Los Angeles home, Lynch \u2013 dressed in a trademark black shirt and full of beans after a morning\u2019s meditation and coffee drinking \u2013 discussed some of the more outlandish responses to Twin Peaks, as well as Brexit, his love of factories, and why the chickens are coming home to roost for America. What should we expect from your season at the Manchester international festival? My participation is paintings, drawings, lithographs and some sculpture. They\u2019ve done a great job hanging the show \u2013 it\u2019s going to look very sharp. And then my friend Chrysta Bell [the Texan musician who plays FBI agent Tammy Preston in Twin Peaks: The Return] is going to be there with some music [hosting live performances by Anna Calvi, These New Puritans and Hatis Noit]. There\u2019s a cinema section too, including films that have influenced you over the years, such as 8\u00bd, The Wizard of Oz, Sunset Boulevard. Why are these important to you? Federico Fellini is one of the all-time great film-makers and 8\u00bd is maybe my favourite of his \u2013 I did a whole series of lithographs based on the last scenes in that movie. The Wizard of Oz is a cosmic film and meaningful on many, many different levels, and Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of the most beautiful songs ever.

So instead of hobnobbing with other G20 leaders in Japan, the president known popularly as \u201cAmlo\u201d was in Mexico City, preparing to address thousands of supporters in the city\u2019s central square on Monday. During last year\u2019s election campaign, L\u00f3pez Obrador drew comparisons with Donald Trump for his appeal to ordinary people, his disdain for elites and critical media. And like Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador hasn\u2019t stopped campaigning since he took office. Throughout the past year, L\u00f3pez Obrador has criss-crossed the country with a string of public appearances in which he has promised jobs, development and infrastructure projects. Unlike Trump, however, L\u00f3pez Obrador has remained broadly popular, with an approval rating hovering at around 70%.

L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s win was hailed as a turning point for Mexico\u2019s left, as the famously frugal president took the discourse of a fairer country to the presidential palace when he took office on office 1 December 2018. But although L\u00f3pez Obrador declared neoliberalism \u201cdead\u201d in Mexico, his austerity turned out to be more than personal: he has slashed social spending and fired thousands of civil servants. And under the relentless attacks from Donald Trump, L\u00f3pez Obrador has steadfastly refused to rise to the bait: he agreed to crack down on migration enforcement to avert US tariffs on Mexican exports, and his government beat Canada and the US to sign off first on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which replaced Nafta.

A decade on from the financial crisis, the political foundations of the postwar (and post-cold-war) liberal order appear to be crumbling.</p> <p>But while anti-immigrant rhetoric and sentiment are common themes, the circumstances of individual countries are very different. In the US, Trump\u2019s focus is on irregular migration from Mexico and Central America and its supposed impact on crime and security, although there is little or no evidence, in the US or elsewhere, to substantiate his claims. In the UK, the ostensible focus of the Brexit campaign was on EU free movement, predominantly by white eastern Europeans, although future migration from Turkey and points farther east was also a strong theme. In western European countries such as Sweden, Germany, France and Italy, rightwing populists were boosted by public reaction to refugee and migrant flows from Syria and Africa. And in Poland and Hungary, while immigrant flows are extremely small, parties in power have successfully appealed to nationalist sentiments by focusing on the threat of Muslim immigration overrunning \u201cChristian\u201d Europe.</p> <p>Twitter is full of lunatics who talk about \u201crace replacement\u201d or \u201cwhite genocide\u201d. But more respectable versions of much the same argument can be found in the mainstream press. London\u2019s population is no longer majority \u201cwhite British\u201d, but most of us were born in the UK and even more identify as British (white, black, Asian or mixed) and have British citizenship. Nevertheless, the eminent economist Paul Collier <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2491733/With-Britains-population-set-grow-10-million--The-dangerous-liberal-myth-racist-want-curb-immigration.html\" title=\"\">claims</a> that the \u201cindigenous British [have] become a minority in their own capital\u201d. <em>Spectator</em> writer Douglas Murray, who argues for reducing or eliminating Muslim immigration, <a href=\"https://standpointmag.co.uk/issues/march-2013/features-march-13-census-that-revealed-a-troubling-future-douglas-murray-immigration-multiculturalism-race-ethnicity/\" title=\"\">says </a> London has become a \u201cforeign country\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Whiteshift-Populism-Immigration-Future-Majorities/dp/024131710X\" title=\"\">Eric Kaufmann</a>, a political scientist and author of <em>Whiteshift</em>, suggests that we should favour immigrants from ethnic or cultural backgrounds who are easier to \u201cassimilate\u201d into the white majority. The favourite philosopher of some Conservatives, Roger Scruton, <a href=\"https://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2019/04/25/scruton-is-part-of-an-intellectual-culture-giving-respectabi\" title=\"\">thinks</a> it\u2019s impossible for the (British-born) children of Muslim immigrants to be loyal British citizens. So the view that only white people can be \u201creally\u201d British, and that black or Asian Britons are still somehow alien and threatening, remains prevalent in some elite circles.</p> <p>Some argue that if progressive politicians fail to accommodate these views, they will drive their traditional voters to the populist right. But there\u2019s little evidence that this will help those most vulnerable to the lure of rightwing populism or improve public perceptions of immigration. Instead, countries such as Ireland, Canada, and Spain have combined relatively open policies with public consent by building a pro-migration coalition across much of the political spectrum.</p> <p>Germany offers a particularly striking example. Amid the panic about the refugee influx in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/economic-europe-refugees_b_8128288?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJw-TVb5eMjiMnbgrRg7s46vy0_7LYMSlu1BvUcNMvJnG7lMqkJt5pFPoQcTN4VScpTD7zaGIjG7qLT8EctXiPeYef78JkOIrHj_58QjYPAgrcBWQ3uInUfTXmyjMQcW8ts31kv1PrI5Unm7MXiW1fc6MR4EUkecnbVUEEdipmT5\" title=\"\">I wrote that</a> it was an opportunity more than a threat. But many argued that it would be impossible, economically, socially or politically, to absorb so many people from supposedly \u201calien\u201d cultures. But three years on, while far from perfect, the balance sheet appears <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germany-passes-refugee-migration-stress-test-expert-report/a-48639433\" title=\"\">mostly positive</a>. Refugees are learning German and getting jobs. Although the far right continues to try to whip up anti-immigrant hysteria, crime is at its lowest level in almost 30 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7b6bc52e1008108b606d9574ada34c4bae381b4/0_268_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man holds one hand to his lips with a picture of the German chancellor Angela Merkel in his other hand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A migrant from Syria holds a picture of the German chancellor Angela Merkel as he and about 800 others arrive in Munich on 5 September 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brexit, paradoxically, offers a window of opportunity. The most illiberal and restrictionist prime minister in living memory is about to depart. Public concern about immigration has fallen sharply and attitudes towards its effects are more positive than for many years. Both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, as well as the home secretary, Sajid Javid, have signalled that they want an immigration policy better attuned to the needs of the UK economy.</p> <p>Politicians could make the case for liberal policy not just on economic grounds but much more broadly, defending the rights of immigrants, eg EU citizens resident in the UK, UK-born children of immigrants who are denied British citizenship, UK citizens who marry people from abroad, and so on. This would also include a more positive approach to the impacts of immigration on communities and services at a local level \u2013 by promoting integration and channelling funding to areas where there are pressures resulting from population growth. There is a chance for a \u201creset moment\u201d not just in policy but in our wider public and political attitudes to immigration and immigrants: we should not let it slip away.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London and the author of </em>What Do We Know and What Should We Do About Immigration?</p>",

Germany offers a particularly striking example. Amid the panic about the refugee influx in 2015, I wrote that it was an opportunity more than a threat. But many argued that it would be impossible, economically, socially or politically, to absorb so many people from supposedly \u201calien\u201d cultures. But three years on, while far from perfect, the balance sheet appears mostly positive. Refugees are learning German and getting jobs. Although the far right continues to try to whip up anti-immigrant hysteria, crime is at its lowest level in almost 30 years. Brexit, paradoxically, offers a window of opportunity. The most illiberal and restrictionist prime minister in living memory is about to depart. Public concern about immigration has fallen sharply and attitudes towards its effects are more positive than for many years. Both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, as well as the home secretary, Sajid Javid, have signalled that they want an immigration policy better attuned to the needs of the UK economy. Politicians could make the case for liberal policy not just on economic grounds but much more broadly, defending the rights of immigrants, eg EU citizens resident in the UK, UK-born children of immigrants who are denied British citizenship, UK citizens who marry people from abroad, and so on. This would also include a more positive approach to the impacts of immigration on communities and services at a local level \u2013 by promoting integration and channelling funding to areas where there are pressures resulting from population growth. There is a chance for a \u201creset moment\u201d not just in policy but in our wider public and political attitudes to immigration and immigrants: we should not let it slip away. \u2022 Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London and the author of What Do We Know and What Should We Do About Immigration?",

      "body": "<p>Milky tea, fish and chips, the local pub: these were once the enticing mainstays of British life. They\u2019re all still there, of course, but outside the home we drink far more coffee than tea, and on the high street the curry house and chicken takeaway long ago supplanted the deep-fried attractions of the fish and chip shop. Of the traditional triumvirate only the public house remains in a primary position, but that too is under threat.</p> <p>It is estimated that Britain has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/26/uk-pub-closures-financial-crisis-birmingham-ons-figures\" title=\"\">lost 25% of its pubs </a>in the last 20 years. There were around 60,000 in 2000 and now the figure is about 45,000. Closing time has taken on a new meaning, with on average one pub closing down every 12 hours. Of those that remain, many are unrecognisable from the locals of the past, having been re-themed as chain bars or gastropubs.</p> <p>Is this a loss to the British way of life? Has some vital part of the social fabric been neglected and left to slowly fall apart? Listen to the doomsayers, like the <a href=\"https://www.camra.org.uk/press_release/pub-closures-are-making-us-all-poorer-says-camra/\" title=\"\">Campaign for Real Ale </a>(Camra), and that\u2019s certainly the impression. Last year it described<strong> </strong>the situation as \u201cdismal\u201d. Almost on cue, Soho\u2019s celebrated Coach &amp; Horses <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/bars/soho-coach-and-horses-fullers-takeover-a4160371.html\" title=\"\">closed its doors</a> last week after its freeholder, Fuller\u2019s Brewery, took back possession from the leaseholder, Alastair Choat. The pub has been a Soho institution for many decades, with the previous landlord, Norman Balon, famed for his rudeness and, paradoxically, the permissive atmosphere he fostered.</p> <p>It was the scene of <em>Private Eye </em>lunches and the base, as it were, of the notoriously unsober <em>Spectator </em>columnist Jeffrey Bernard. Choat tried to maintain its idiosyncratic spirit, by turning it into what he called London\u2019s first vegetarian and vegan pub and getting a licence to serve naked guests.</p> <p>He made a desperate campaign to keep hold of the pub, even staging a shortened version of the play <em>Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell</em> with <em>Cold Feet</em>\u2019s Robert Bathurst in the lead role, and organising a 12,000-signature petition to halt Fuller\u2019s. But all to no avail. Fuller\u2019s moved back with a promise to restore the pub to its \u201cformer glory\u201d.</p> <p>Given that its former glory was all about its inimitable ambience, it is not clear how that restoration is going to be achieved. What is significant, though, is that Fuller\u2019s is appealing to a vanished heyday as the vision of its future. But heydays are accidental or inspired and certainly can\u2019t be recaptured through corporate planning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ebcbf81b07f8b44fd88b9c80a03a15fa8cbeea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebcbf81b07f8b44fd88b9c80a03a15fa8cbeea1/0_156_3261_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Choat, landlord of the Coach And Horses in Soho, London, and his daughter Hollie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Choat, landlord of the Coach and Horses, and his daughter Hollie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth the Soho that the Coach and Horses epitomised \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/19/rupert-everett-in-defence-of-prostitutes\" title=\"\">bohemian, transgressive, hopelessly drunk</a> \u2013 no longer exists, and any attempt to return to the \u201cfeatures that have made it such a famous pub\u201d, as Fuller\u2019s pledges to do, are doomed to be an exercise in museum curation. What we most love about the past is that is no longer here.</p> <p>Yearning for the idealised pub of yore is not, however, a new pastime. It\u2019s probably almost as old as pubs themselves. Indeed, reminiscing about how a given pub used to be is a staple of pub conversation. The nostalgic lament is, after all, practically a symptom of inebriation.</p> <p>Seventy-three years ago George Orwell <a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-moon-under-water/\" title=\"\">wrote his famous essay</a> about his favourite public house, the Moon Under Water. He listed 10 qualities possessed by this pub, only to reveal at the end that no such pub existed. It was an ideal he\u2019d wished into being.</p> <p>Ironically, many of the things he desired \u2013 Victorian fittings, cast-iron fireplaces, food, garden, family-friendly \u2013 have become fashionable in recent years. Orwell wanted more women and children to be able to visit pubs, and perhaps the most important change in pub culture is that they are no longer a dimly lit masculine preserve. In a survey a few years ago, more than 50% of female respondents said they regularly visited pubs.</p> <p>Of the pubs that have closed, the majority have been small, and therefore perhaps the kind that struggled to attract women.

Not Shakespeare or the royal palaces or the Lake District, but a pub crawl. In the words of the late Derek Jameson, do they mean us?</p> <p>Last Thursday evening in Southwark, I joined John Warland, who set up Liquid History Tours eight years ago, and a Californian couple, John Rae and his wife Colleen, who had arranged their own private pub tour. Rae has already twice been on the main tour that made the Travellers\u2019 Choice awards list, which he describes as the best he has ever experienced.</p> <p>\u201cI like learning about history while getting a little bit drunk,\u201d he explains, not unreasonably. We started at the George, off Borough High Street, the last surviving galleried coaching inn. It dates to at least 1543, and quite possibly back to Chaucer\u2019s days \u2013 <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> (written in the late 14th century) begins at a similar nearby inn, the Tabard, which has not survived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cea4326d294e9029add0fdddb567582422d90d83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cea4326d294e9029add0fdddb567582422d90d83/0_205_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The George Inn just off Borough High Street London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The George Inn, just off Borough High Street, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Setchfield/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Warland reminded us, Dickens mentions the George in <em>Little Dorrit</em>, and was a frequent visitor to the pub himself. But then he was a frequent visitor to many pubs around London and Kent. Any serious study of the subject will sooner or later come back to literature, which has enjoyed a long and fruitfully symbiotic relationship with pubs.</p> <p>If you want to know about the London demi-monde in the 1930s and 1940s, for instance, then there is no more vividly informative place to turn than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/06/patrick-hamilton-hangover-square-world-slide-abyss-rereading\" title=\"\">the novels of Patrick Hamilton</a>. His prose hits you with the smell of beer and cigarettes as if you\u2019d opened a saloon bar door from that the period. Hamilton, it should be noted, died of cirrhosis of the liver.</p> <p>Warland is a font of major and minor cultural knowledge, as he leads us through Borough Market, with two brief pale ale pit-stops, and past the Globe theatre, with full Shakespeare digression, over the Millennium bridge, where he points out the artist Ben Wilson\u2019s micro-works on flattened chewing gum, to two pubs, the Cockpit and the art nouveau wonder the Black Friar, that, coincidentally, were past watering holes for the <em>Observer\u2019s</em> ever-thirsty staff.</p> <p>The ever-welcoming Cockpit abuts a building on St Andrew\u2019s Hill that used to be one of of the <em>Observer\u2019s</em> many previous homes. As Peter Corrigan, a former sports editor of this newspaper, once put it: \u201cIf you had taken away the Cockpit, the <em>Observer</em> would have collapsed in more ways than one.\u201d</p> <p>We move on to Fleet Street, where the word and the wine once lived in productive if unruly unison. Nowadays newspapers, following Rupert Murdoch\u2019s lead, have long since departed the area, journalism runs on sparkling water, and newspaper offices are about as wild and hectic as those of your average accountancy firm.</p> <p>At the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, dating from 1538, I leave the tour, and in a parting comment Warland observes that, in his experience, good pubs tend to survive. No doubt he\u2019s right, although it does raise the question again of what makes a good pub.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0cef532e106f5399161824941d9f5a40f3dc37e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0cef532e106f5399161824941d9f5a40f3dc37e/0_104_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s oldest pub, Ye Olde Fighting Cocks in St Albans, Hertfordshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s oldest pub, Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, in St Albans, Hertfordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cath Harries/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seeking more objective criteria, I went in search of Britain\u2019s oldest pub.

      "bodyText": "Milky tea, fish and chips, the local pub: these were once the enticing mainstays of British life. They\u2019re all still there, of course, but outside the home we drink far more coffee than tea, and on the high street the curry house and chicken takeaway long ago supplanted the deep-fried attractions of the fish and chip shop. Of the traditional triumvirate only the public house remains in a primary position, but that too is under threat. It is estimated that Britain has lost 25% of its pubs in the last 20 years. There were around 60,000 in 2000 and now the figure is about 45,000. Closing time has taken on a new meaning, with on average one pub closing down every 12 hours. Of those that remain, many are unrecognisable from the locals of the past, having been re-themed as chain bars or gastropubs. Is this a loss to the British way of life? Has some vital part of the social fabric been neglected and left to slowly fall apart? Listen to the doomsayers, like the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and that\u2019s certainly the impression. Last year it described the situation as \u201cdismal\u201d. Almost on cue, Soho\u2019s celebrated Coach &amp; Horses closed its doors last week after its freeholder, Fuller\u2019s Brewery, took back possession from the leaseholder, Alastair Choat. The pub has been a Soho institution for many decades, with the previous landlord, Norman Balon, famed for his rudeness and, paradoxically, the permissive atmosphere he fostered. It was the scene of Private Eye lunches and the base, as it were, of the notoriously unsober Spectator columnist Jeffrey Bernard. Choat tried to maintain its idiosyncratic spirit, by turning it into what he called London\u2019s first vegetarian and vegan pub and getting a licence to serve naked guests. He made a desperate campaign to keep hold of the pub, even staging a shortened version of the play Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell with Cold Feet\u2019s Robert Bathurst in the lead role, and organising a 12,000-signature petition to halt Fuller\u2019s. But all to no avail. Fuller\u2019s moved back with a promise to restore the pub to its \u201cformer glory\u201d. Given that its former glory was all about its inimitable ambience, it is not clear how that restoration is going to be achieved. What is significant, though, is that Fuller\u2019s is appealing to a vanished heyday as the vision of its future. But heydays are accidental or inspired and certainly can\u2019t be recaptured through corporate planning. In truth the Soho that the Coach and Horses epitomised \u2013 bohemian, transgressive, hopelessly drunk \u2013 no longer exists, and any attempt to return to the \u201cfeatures that have made it such a famous pub\u201d, as Fuller\u2019s pledges to do, are doomed to be an exercise in museum curation. What we most love about the past is that is no longer here. Yearning for the idealised pub of yore is not, however, a new pastime. It\u2019s probably almost as old as pubs themselves. Indeed, reminiscing about how a given pub used to be is a staple of pub conversation. The nostalgic lament is, after all, practically a symptom of inebriation. Seventy-three years ago George Orwell wrote his famous essay about his favourite public house, the Moon Under Water. He listed 10 qualities possessed by this pub, only to reveal at the end that no such pub existed. It was an ideal he\u2019d wished into being. Ironically, many of the things he desired \u2013 Victorian fittings, cast-iron fireplaces, food, garden, family-friendly \u2013 have become fashionable in recent years. Orwell wanted more women and children to be able to visit pubs, and perhaps the most important change in pub culture is that they are no longer a dimly lit masculine preserve. In a survey a few years ago, more than 50% of female respondents said they regularly visited pubs. Of the pubs that have closed, the majority have been small, and therefore perhaps the kind that struggled to attract women. At the same time, micropubs that, with a nod to Orwell, prioritise authenticity, good beer, and abjure games and machines, have flourished in recent years. Turnover across the pub business has actually remained the same, which suggests that things are not as bad as the closures suggest. Other elements of Orwell\u2019s checklist \u2013 that the pub be tobacco-smoke stained and that motherly barmaids should address customers as \u201cdear\u201d (\u201cpubs where the barmaids call you \u2018ducky\u2019 always have a disagreeable raffish atmosphere\u201d) \u2013 have not aged so well. Orwell\u2019s biographer DJ Taylor has noted that pubs were \u201ca symbol of working-class life that [Orwell] tended to sentimentalise\u201d. But in a sense pubs are a symbol of whatever community it is we tend to sentimentalise. And when in multicultural Britain they are not able to facilitate that symbolism \u2013 the Muslim pub, for example, is almost an oxymoron \u2013 then they can also represent division and exclusion.

Viewed from abroad, of course, these differences dissolve into a wholesome image.

Last year was all about trying (and, in the end, failing) to get Warren Barguil into the polka dots. This year Andre Griepel has joined up so expect to see at least one Arkea-Samsic jersey at the business end of the flat stages.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Warren Barguil </strong>The 2017 King of the Mountains was second behind Julian Alaphilippe last year and will give it his all once the gradients go up. Until then the focus will be on the Gorilla.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Barguil is a fan of French Ligue 2 side Lorient and is friends with former Lorient and now Dortmund player Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> Barguil, Greipel, Delaplace, Gespert, Vachon, Bouet, plus two TBC </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6579f2acf493b11814ac13b903843408ada6c7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6579f2acf493b11814ac13b903843408ada6c7a1/1845_573_2644_1586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre Greipel will be on the hunt for sprint victories\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre Greipel will be on the hunt for sprint victories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>ASTANA</strong></h2> <p>The Kazakh squad won two stages last year \u2013 Omar Fraile and Magnus Cort Nielsen winning back to back between the Alps and Pyrenees \u2013 and similar smash-and-grab raids seemed to be all that was in the offing again this time around. That changed, though, when Jakob Fuglsang took victory in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 \u2013 a race won by Chris Froome before his Tour wins in 2013, 2015 and 2016, and by Geraint Thomas last year.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Jakob Fuglsang </strong>The 34-year-old Dane (whose name translates as \u201cBirdsong\u201d) finished just outside the top 10 in 2018 and is having a great year: he won Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge in the spring and the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 (for the second time) this month.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>The team\u2019s general manager, Alexander Vinokourov, is an honorary colonel in the Kazakh army.

His Nibz, having finished second in the Giro, says he \u201cwon\u2019t necessarily go for the GC\u201d which would be good news for Damiano Caruso, Matej Mohoric and Domenico Pozzovivo who will fancy joining the Italian in search of stage wins.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Vincenzo Nibali </strong>The Italian is a modern great but he tends not to race both the Giro and the Tour. His decision to do so this year suggests he\u2019s either feeling fantastic or has his eyes on the polka dots. Either way, he\u2019s likely to enliven the race in the mountains.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>McLaren, as in F1\u2019s McLaren, is a 50% owner of the team (a deal that was ever-so-slightly overshadowed as it was announced on the same day Sky decided to pull out of cycling).</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> TBC</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"088ae0835eec05a2054a39b731f1d6a7019087b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088ae0835eec05a2054a39b731f1d6a7019087b0/0_205_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vincenzo Nibali after the finish of the Giro in Verona\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vincenzo Nibali after the finish of the Giro in Verona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Di Meo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>BORA-HANSGROHE</strong></h2> <p>The German team had a fine Tour in 2018, with Peter Sagan winning three stages and the green jersey. Rafal Majka is likely to be their GC contender again, though in truth the only jersey the Polish rider is likely to wear is the one with polka dots. Emanuel Buchmann has had solid season so far (he was third in the Dauphin\u00e9) and is improving all the time, while sprinter Sam Bennett won two stages at Paris\u2013Nice.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Peter Sagan </strong>Has owned the green jersey since 2012 (his controversial expulsion in 2017 excluded) \u2013 but there are a few doubts creeping in for once. If he claims green again he will take sole ownership of the Tour record. Stage nine on Bastille Day looks tailor-made for him.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Bass playing, Nirvana-loving, self-described \u201cgrunge cyclist\u201d Daniel Oss says he has one regret in the sport: not stopping for a beer with fans on Alpe d\u2019Huez during the Tour in 2015.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> Sagan, Buchmann, Konrad, Oss, P\u00f6stlberger, Muehlberger, plus two TBC</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9f7f621556928ed342a78f75927ab03205d2b34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9f7f621556928ed342a78f75927ab03205d2b34/0_53_2899_1740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Sagan celebrates winning the third stage of the Tour of Switzerland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Sagan celebrates winning the third stage of the Tour of Switzerland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>CCC</strong></h2> <p>Goodbye BMC, hello CCC. Orange is the new black-and-red. And it\u2019s a much-changed lineup with Richie Porte, Tejay van Garderen, Stefan K\u00fcng and Damiano Caruso among a raft of departures. Greg van Avermaet is still around, though, and the vastly experienced Serge Pauwels and Laurens Ten Dam will provide support.</p> <p><strong>Main man:</strong> <strong>Greg van Avermaet </strong>The Belgian, for so long a beast in the Classics, provided one of the stories of the Tour last year, taking the yellow jersey after the team time trial on stage three and holding it through stage 10, the first day in the Alps. But he\u2019s not had the best of seasons so far.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Van Avermaet was a goalkeeper on the books of Belgian football club Beveren as a teenager.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> TBC</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96104b2c885c7c17f87e0b608cb66c050a7f4015\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96104b2c885c7c17f87e0b608cb66c050a7f4015/0_579_4875_2925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Van Avermaet at the Tour of Switzerland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Van Avermaet at the Tour of Switzerland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>COFIDIS, SOLUTIONS CREDITS</strong></h2> <p>The playbook for the perennial wildcard team will remain the same: get into the breaks \u2013 <em>all the breaks </em>\u2013 and see what happens. Christophe Laporte had the sprinting duties last year after Nacer Bouhanni and the team management fell out, but his best effort was second on stage 18.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Nacer Bouhanni </strong>A throwback wildman who could start an argument in an empty room is likely to be back on the startline after missing the 2018 edition. Abandoned the Dauphin\u00e9 during the second stage but at least he managed to do so without chinning anybody.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike</strong> Darwin Atapuma says the thing he misses most from his native Colombia is the food \u2013 particularly cuy (guinea pig).</p> <p><strong>Squad: </strong>TBC</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86038cae821a91accb14d1ae31dc882f10d95420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86038cae821a91accb14d1ae31dc882f10d95420/0_105_5410_3246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nacer Bouhanni might be back on the startline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nacer Bouhanni might be back on the startline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>DECEUNINCK-QUICK-STEP</strong></h2> <p>A team that can do it all \u2013 Julian Alaphilippe was King of the Mountains last year and could claim the polka dots again; Elie Viviani can sprint with the best of them; Yves Lampaert will look for the breaks; Enric Mas can threaten the top 10 on GC. Fernando Gaviria won the opening stage last year but he\u2019s gone, giving the team a wider focus. The challenge might be in squeezing all their talent into an eight-man team.</p> <p><strong>Main man:</strong> <strong>Julian Alaphilippe </strong>Won two mountain stages and the polka dots last year, and added Milan-San Remo to his palmar\u00e8s this spring. Expect to see him outsprinting the climbers and outclimbing just about everybody.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Philippe Gilbert \u2013 who, disappointingly, has not been selected \u2013 owns a bike shop in Monaco, imaginatively called \u201cThe Bike Shop by Philippe Gilbert\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> Alaphilippe, Asgreen, Devenys, Lampaert, Mas, Morkov, Richeze, Viviani </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed0d160a0de3864cc36209c3364cbeb7163c3641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed0d160a0de3864cc36209c3364cbeb7163c3641/0_54_2103_1262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"France\u2019s Julian Alaphilippe: king of the climbers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France\u2019s Julian Alaphilippe: king of the climbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>DIMENSION DATA</strong></h2> <p>The South African team have a couple of cards to play, with Edvald Boasson Hagen in decent form so far this year and Mark Cavendish making optimistic noises about his fitness after two years lost to the Epstein Barr virus. There\u2019s plenty of experience in the squad, with Bernhard Eisel and Mark Renshaw riding in support and Roman Kreuziger a new arrival.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Mark Cavendish </strong>Still stuck on 30 stage wins, four behind the record held by Eddy Merckx. His last one was in 2016, when it seemed certain he\u2019d blast past the Cannibal, but after two injury-plagued seasons can he rediscover his best form?</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Ben King is an experienced bow hunter. \u201cThere\u2019s something more primitive and satisfying about it. It\u2019s more of an art and a challenge.\u201d He says friends call him \u201can educated redneck\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Squad: </strong>TBC</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd0ef16db44c5ed3eca2f3e86d429ac986ad3931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd0ef16db44c5ed3eca2f3e86d429ac986ad3931/0_229_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Mark Cavendish get back to somewhere near his best?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Mark Cavendish get back to somewhere near his best?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>EF EDUCATION FIRST</strong></h2> <p>Another team of all the talents, sponsored by an educational company who presumably go to the ATM machine and put in their PIN number on the LCD display. The former Sky rider Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n is likely to be the nominal leader but the Canadian Michael Woods has had an impressive year and the 2012 white jersey winner, Tejay van Garderen, a new signing for this season, suggested he may be returning to his best with second in the Dauphin\u00e9. Alberto Bettiol surprised everyone to win Ronde van Vlaanderen in the spring and may get the chance to ride the Tour again, having missed out in 2018. Add in Sep Vanmarcke, Tanel Kangert, Simon Clarke and Taylor Phinney and they have a squad that can conjure wins from all angles.</p> <p><strong>Main man:</strong> <strong>Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n </strong>The laid-back Colombian, who finished second behind Chris Froome in 2017 before crashing out last year, will start as the team leader though Woods and Van Garderen provide potential plan Bs.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>After Lawson Craddock crashed on the opening stage last year, fracturing his shoulder, he pledged to donate $100 for every stage he finished to the Greater Houston Cycling Association. He finished as the lanterne rouge but raised $200,000.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> TBC</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2aba42ddb5a941e46a81b757fe6e01611e89908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2aba42ddb5a941e46a81b757fe6e01611e89908/0_310_5120_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tejay van Garderen in time-trial mode during the Dauphin\u00e9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tejay van Garderen in time-trial mode during the Dauphin\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>GROUPAMA-FDJ</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps the Frenchest of the French teams \u2013 their red, white and blue jerseys make sure of that \u2013 are putting everything behind the darling of French cycling, Thibaut Pinot, who is back on the startline after missing the 2018 race through illness. With Pinot\u2019s plans in mind sprinter Arnaud D\u00e9mare has been left out, while his breakaway-loving support team will have to forget about personal glory this time around.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Thibaut Pinot </strong>Allez Thibaut! Allez! It\u2019s seven years since Pinot, then aged 22, won in Porrentruy with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMmyyEOeVTs\">Marc Madiot screaming in his ear</a> and, despite finishing third in 2014, he\u2019s been short of success on the roads of France. Missed last year\u2019s race after being hospitalised with exhaustion at the 2018 Giro but is back and seems to be in decent form.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike</strong> Pinot is a Paris Saint-Germain fan and met the squad (including then manager Unai Emery) in 2016. Pinot described Emery\u2019s office as \u201csimple and effective\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> Pinot, Bonnet, Reichenbach, Molard, Ladagnous, Gaudu, Roux, K\u00fcng </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1254df4b742078050f86d73710b239f2a9340ed5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1254df4b742078050f86d73710b239f2a9340ed5/0_222_3920_2353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thibaut Pinot will have high hopes of finishing in the top 10, at the very least\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thibaut Pinot will have high hopes of finishing in the top 10, at the very least.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>INEOS</strong></h2> <p>Well at least they\u2019ll have a clear plan. It seemed the Chris Froome/Geraint Thomas dynamic would be the dominant narrative of the Tour but Froome\u2019s crash at the Dauphin\u00e9 put paid to that. Instead the battle looks to be between Thomas and the young Colombian Egan Bernal, who have been named as joint leaders. As ever, they will look to dictate the pace in the mountains and, as ever, they look to have the team to do it, even without their four-time champion.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Geraint Thomas </strong>Won the Dauphin\u00e9 before his 2018 victory but opted for the Tour of Switzerland this time around and promptly caused panic by falling off. The damage was minor but some serious training rides have been required in the aftermath.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Thomas is well known for his ability to switch off from racing. \u201cWhen he is off the bike he goes quite crazy with fun,\u201d says his teammate Wout Poels.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> Thomas, Bernal, Castroviejo, Kwiatkowski, Moscon, Poels, Rowe, Van Baarle </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4af3f21fa0b35d895398f30f7d066629564b5999\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4af3f21fa0b35d895398f30f7d066629564b5999/0_353_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Geraint Thomas has lost a key ally in Chris Froome but the Ineos team remains formidable\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geraint Thomas has lost a key ally in Chris Froome but the Ineos team remains formidable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>JUMBO-VISMA</strong></h2> <p>Primoz Roglic (fourth last year) is having a rest after his Giro exertions so the initial focus will be on Dylan Groenewegen\u2019s attempts to add to the two stage he won last year. George Bennett and Steven Kruijswijk will both trouble the top 10 on GC, while Wout van Aert is a fascinating callup \u2013 the three-times world cyclo-cross champion a constant threat in the Classics this spring.</p> <p><strong>Main man:</strong> <strong>Dylan Groenewegen </strong>The prospect of flat-stage sprint battles between the Dutchman and Fernando Gaviria is mouthwatering. Groenewegen should be reasonably fresh having skipped the Giro but with no Roglic to provide TT stage wins the pressure will be on the sprinter.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Tony Martin and his parents fled Cold War East Germany to the west via Hungary and Austria. \u201cThe whole operation was pretty dangerous,\u201d he says.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> Kruijwijk, Van Aert, De Plus, Bennett, Groenwegen, Teunissen, Grondahl, Martin </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f0b000814bce844553540a9eefdb2c01433ac1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f0b000814bce844553540a9eefdb2c01433ac1f/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wout van Aert will ride in his first Grand Tour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wout van Aert will ride in his first Grand Tour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>KATUSHA-ALPECIN</strong></h2> <p>Marcel Kittel\u2019s decision in May to step away from the sport leaves Katusha\u2013Alpecin without their biggest hitter and means the team will have a different focus. Ilnur Zakarin is usually a good bet for the top 10 in Grand Tours (he was 10th in the Giro this year). Nils Politt may be eyeing a big victory having come so close at Paris-Roubaix and enjoyed a decent Dauphin\u00e9.</p> <p><strong>Main man: Ilnur Zakarin </strong>The Russian was banned for doping as a teenager but has a fine record in Grand Tours, with four top-10 finishes in his last five outings.

This time new signing Richie Porte is the great hope. He has a strong team around him, though: Bauke Mollema has three top-10 finishes to his name, while Koen de Kort, Toms Skujins and Jasper Stuyven are capable riders. Sprinter John Degenkolb is likely to be left out with the team putting all their energies into the GC battle.</p> <p><strong>Main man:</strong> <strong>Richie Porte </strong>Perhaps the unluckiest man in the peloton after crashes in 2017 and 2018, and with Vincenzo Nibali joining the team next year, the Australian may be feeling time is running out.</p> <p><strong>Off the bike </strong>Bauke Mollema got into cycling after riding 12km to school, where he \u201cconcentrated in ancient language and culture, especially Roman\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Squad:</strong> Porte, Bernard, Ciccone, De Kort, Felline, Mollema, Skujins, Stuyven </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abf11703dbeff20c405c1e86cb7802869e43b302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abf11703dbeff20c405c1e86cb7802869e43b302/0_276_5120_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richie Porte is a new signing for Trek-Segafredo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richie Porte is a new signing for Trek-Segafredo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>UAE TEAM EMIRATES</strong></h2> <p>A fascinating lineup with the absence of Fernando Gaviria offset by the return of Fabio Aru.

      "bodyText": "AG2R LA MONDIALE Perennial French challengers who\u2019ll come to the fore when the race goes uphill (which this year is pretty much straight away). Expect to see their brown shorts in plenty of breaks, especially if/when Romain Bardet\u2019s GC hopes fade. Main man: Romain Bardet After five top 10 finishes in the tour and two podiums, he can\u2019t really be described as France\u2019s next big thing any longer (his teammate Pierre Latour was the white jersey winner in 2018 and despite his season disrupted by a fractured wrist has taken up the mantle). Time trial remains a concern \u2013 even with just 27km of TT at the Tour. Support comes from Belgian Classics hardman Oliver Naesen. Off the bike Tony Gallopin is one half of a cycling power couple \u2013 his wife is former French national road racing champion Marion Rousse. Squad: Bardet, Naesen, Gallopin, Cosnefroy, Latour, Cherel, Frank, TBC ARKEA-SAMSIC Wildcard regulars over the last few years who have an intriguing new string to their bow. Last year was all about trying (and, in the end, failing) to get Warren Barguil into the polka dots. This year Andre Griepel has joined up so expect to see at least one Arkea-Samsic jersey at the business end of the flat stages. Main man: Warren Barguil The 2017 King of the Mountains was second behind Julian Alaphilippe last year and will give it his all once the gradients go up. Until then the focus will be on the Gorilla. Off the bike Barguil is a fan of French Ligue 2 side Lorient and is friends with former Lorient and now Dortmund player Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro. Squad: Barguil, Greipel, Delaplace, Gespert, Vachon, Bouet, plus two TBC ASTANA The Kazakh squad won two stages last year \u2013 Omar Fraile and Magnus Cort Nielsen winning back to back between the Alps and Pyrenees \u2013 and similar smash-and-grab raids seemed to be all that was in the offing again this time around. That changed, though, when Jakob Fuglsang took victory in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 \u2013 a race won by Chris Froome before his Tour wins in 2013, 2015 and 2016, and by Geraint Thomas last year. Main man: Jakob Fuglsang The 34-year-old Dane (whose name translates as \u201cBirdsong\u201d) finished just outside the top 10 in 2018 and is having a great year: he won Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge in the spring and the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 (for the second time) this month. Off the bike The team\u2019s general manager, Alexander Vinokourov, is an honorary colonel in the Kazakh army. His excuse after being done for doping in the 2007 Tour? \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake. There was an enormous amount of blood in my thighs, which could have led to my positive test.\u201d Squad: Fuglsang, Gorka Izaguirre, LL S\u00e1nchez, Fraille, Nielsen, Lutsenko, Bilbao, Houle BAHRAIN-MERIDA This will be the Bahraini team\u2019s third Tour and they haven\u2019t made much impact so far, with Vincenzo Nibali crashing out last year. His Nibz, having finished second in the Giro, says he \u201cwon\u2019t necessarily go for the GC\u201d which would be good news for Damiano Caruso, Matej Mohoric and Domenico Pozzovivo who will fancy joining the Italian in search of stage wins. Main man: Vincenzo Nibali The Italian is a modern great but he tends not to race both the Giro and the Tour. His decision to do so this year suggests he\u2019s either feeling fantastic or has his eyes on the polka dots. Either way, he\u2019s likely to enliven the race in the mountains. Off the bike McLaren, as in F1\u2019s McLaren, is a 50% owner of the team (a deal that was ever-so-slightly overshadowed as it was announced on the same day Sky decided to pull out of cycling). Squad: TBC BORA-HANSGROHE The German team had a fine Tour in 2018, with Peter Sagan winning three stages and the green jersey. Rafal Majka is likely to be their GC contender again, though in truth the only jersey the Polish rider is likely to wear is the one with polka dots. Emanuel Buchmann has had solid season so far (he was third in the Dauphin\u00e9) and is improving all the time, while sprinter Sam Bennett won two stages at Paris\u2013Nice. Main man: Peter Sagan Has owned the green jersey since 2012 (his controversial expulsion in 2017 excluded) \u2013 but there are a few doubts creeping in for once. If he claims green again he will take sole ownership of the Tour record. Stage nine on Bastille Day looks tailor-made for him. Off the bike Bass playing, Nirvana-loving, self-described \u201cgrunge cyclist\u201d Daniel Oss says he has one regret in the sport: not stopping for a beer with fans on Alpe d\u2019Huez during the Tour in 2015. Squad: Sagan, Buchmann, Konrad, Oss, P\u00f6stlberger, Muehlberger, plus two TBC CCC Goodbye BMC, hello CCC. Orange is the new black-and-red. And it\u2019s a much-changed lineup with Richie Porte, Tejay van Garderen, Stefan K\u00fcng and Damiano Caruso among a raft of departures. Greg van Avermaet is still around, though, and the vastly experienced Serge Pauwels and Laurens Ten Dam will provide support. Main man: Greg van Avermaet The Belgian, for so long a beast in the Classics, provided one of the stories of the Tour last year, taking the yellow jersey after the team time trial on stage three and holding it through stage 10, the first day in the Alps. But he\u2019s not had the best of seasons so far. Off the bike Van Avermaet was a goalkeeper on the books of Belgian football club Beveren as a teenager. Squad: TBC COFIDIS, SOLUTIONS CREDITS The playbook for the perennial wildcard team will remain the same: get into the breaks \u2013 all the breaks \u2013 and see what happens. Christophe Laporte had the sprinting duties last year after Nacer Bouhanni and the team management fell out, but his best effort was second on stage 18. Main man: Nacer Bouhanni A throwback wildman who could start an argument in an empty room is likely to be back on the startline after missing the 2018 edition. Abandoned the Dauphin\u00e9 during the second stage but at least he managed to do so without chinning anybody. Off the bike Darwin Atapuma says the thing he misses most from his native Colombia is the food \u2013 particularly cuy (guinea pig). Squad: TBC DECEUNINCK-QUICK-STEP A team that can do it all \u2013 Julian Alaphilippe was King of the Mountains last year and could claim the polka dots again; Elie Viviani can sprint with the best of them; Yves Lampaert will look for the breaks; Enric Mas can threaten the top 10 on GC. Fernando Gaviria won the opening stage last year but he\u2019s gone, giving the team a wider focus. The challenge might be in squeezing all their talent into an eight-man team. Main man: Julian Alaphilippe Won two mountain stages and the polka dots last year, and added Milan-San Remo to his palmar\u00e8s this spring. Expect to see him outsprinting the climbers and outclimbing just about everybody. Off the bike Philippe Gilbert \u2013 who, disappointingly, has not been selected \u2013 owns a bike shop in Monaco, imaginatively called \u201cThe Bike Shop by Philippe Gilbert\u201d. Squad: Alaphilippe, Asgreen, Devenys, Lampaert, Mas, Morkov, Richeze, Viviani DIMENSION DATA The South African team have a couple of cards to play, with Edvald Boasson Hagen in decent form so far this year and Mark Cavendish making optimistic noises about his fitness after two years lost to the Epstein Barr virus. There\u2019s plenty of experience in the squad, with Bernhard Eisel and Mark Renshaw riding in support and Roman Kreuziger a new arrival. Main man: Mark Cavendish Still stuck on 30 stage wins, four behind the record held by Eddy Merckx. His last one was in 2016, when it seemed certain he\u2019d blast past the Cannibal, but after two injury-plagued seasons can he rediscover his best form? Off the bike Ben King is an experienced bow hunter. \u201cThere\u2019s something more primitive and satisfying about it. It\u2019s more of an art and a challenge.\u201d He says friends call him \u201can educated redneck\u201d. Squad: TBC EF EDUCATION FIRST Another team of all the talents, sponsored by an educational company who presumably go to the ATM machine and put in their PIN number on the LCD display. The former Sky rider Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n is likely to be the nominal leader but the Canadian Michael Woods has had an impressive year and the 2012 white jersey winner, Tejay van Garderen, a new signing for this season, suggested he may be returning to his best with second in the Dauphin\u00e9. Alberto Bettiol surprised everyone to win Ronde van Vlaanderen in the spring and may get the chance to ride the Tour again, having missed out in 2018. Add in Sep Vanmarcke, Tanel Kangert, Simon Clarke and Taylor Phinney and they have a squad that can conjure wins from all angles. Main man: Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n The laid-back Colombian, who finished second behind Chris Froome in 2017 before crashing out last year, will start as the team leader though Woods and Van Garderen provide potential plan Bs. Off the bike After Lawson Craddock crashed on the opening stage last year, fracturing his shoulder, he pledged to donate $100 for every stage he finished to the Greater Houston Cycling Association. He finished as the lanterne rouge but raised $200,000. Squad: TBC GROUPAMA-FDJ Perhaps the Frenchest of the French teams \u2013 their red, white and blue jerseys make sure of that \u2013 are putting everything behind the darling of French cycling, Thibaut Pinot, who is back on the startline after missing the 2018 race through illness. With Pinot\u2019s plans in mind sprinter Arnaud D\u00e9mare has been left out, while his breakaway-loving support team will have to forget about personal glory this time around. Main man: Thibaut Pinot Allez Thibaut! Allez! It\u2019s seven years since Pinot, then aged 22, won in Porrentruy with Marc Madiot screaming in his ear and, despite finishing third in 2014, he\u2019s been short of success on the roads of France. Missed last year\u2019s race after being hospitalised with exhaustion at the 2018 Giro but is back and seems to be in decent form. Off the bike Pinot is a Paris Saint-Germain fan and met the squad (including then manager Unai Emery) in 2016. Pinot described Emery\u2019s office as \u201csimple and effective\u201d. Squad: Pinot, Bonnet, Reichenbach, Molard, Ladagnous, Gaudu, Roux, K\u00fcng INEOS Well at least they\u2019ll have a clear plan. It seemed the Chris Froome/Geraint Thomas dynamic would be the dominant narrative of the Tour but Froome\u2019s crash at the Dauphin\u00e9 put paid to that. Instead the battle looks to be between Thomas and the young Colombian Egan Bernal, who have been named as joint leaders. As ever, they will look to dictate the pace in the mountains and, as ever, they look to have the team to do it, even without their four-time champion. Main man: Geraint Thomas Won the Dauphin\u00e9 before his 2018 victory but opted for the Tour of Switzerland this time around and promptly caused panic by falling off. The damage was minor but some serious training rides have been required in the aftermath. Off the bike Thomas is well known for his ability to switch off from racing. \u201cWhen he is off the bike he goes quite crazy with fun,\u201d says his teammate Wout Poels. Squad: Thomas, Bernal, Castroviejo, Kwiatkowski, Moscon, Poels, Rowe, Van Baarle JUMBO-VISMA Primoz Roglic (fourth last year) is having a rest after his Giro exertions so the initial focus will be on Dylan Groenewegen\u2019s attempts to add to the two stage he won last year. George Bennett and Steven Kruijswijk will both trouble the top 10 on GC, while Wout van Aert is a fascinating callup \u2013 the three-times world cyclo-cross champion a constant threat in the Classics this spring. Main man: Dylan Groenewegen The prospect of flat-stage sprint battles between the Dutchman and Fernando Gaviria is mouthwatering. Groenewegen should be reasonably fresh having skipped the Giro but with no Roglic to provide TT stage wins the pressure will be on the sprinter. Off the bike Tony Martin and his parents fled Cold War East Germany to the west via Hungary and Austria. \u201cThe whole operation was pretty dangerous,\u201d he says. Squad: Kruijwijk, Van Aert, De Plus, Bennett, Groenwegen, Teunissen, Grondahl, Martin KATUSHA-ALPECIN Marcel Kittel\u2019s decision in May to step away from the sport leaves Katusha\u2013Alpecin without their biggest hitter and means the team will have a different focus. Ilnur Zakarin is usually a good bet for the top 10 in Grand Tours (he was 10th in the Giro this year). Nils Politt may be eyeing a big victory having come so close at Paris-Roubaix and enjoyed a decent Dauphin\u00e9. Main man: Ilnur Zakarin The Russian was banned for doping as a teenager but has a fine record in Grand Tours, with four top-10 finishes in his last five outings. Unlikely to threaten the yellow jersey, though. Off the bike Zakarin used to box and enjoys singing Tatarstani folks songs. Squad: Zakarin, Dowsett, Zabel, Schmidt, Politt, Gon\u00e7alves, Debusschere, Haller LOTTO SOUDAL The Belgian behemoths used to rely on Andre Griepel to guarantee a stage win or two but the Gorilla has swung off for pastures new. That leaves the squad reliant on Caleb Ewan, who surged to two Giro stage wins this year, on the flat stages. They don\u2019t have a GC contender so once we reach they hills there\u2019s free rein for Tiesj Benoot, who was prominent in the Classics this year, and Thomas De Gendt to sniff out opportunities. Main man: Thomas De Gendt Belgian hardman who won the stage to Mont Ventoux in 2016 Off the bike The team\u2019s name comes from a Belgian lottery and a chemical company whose name is a portmanteau of \u201cSoudeert alles\u201d, which translates as \u201cfixes everything\u201d. Squad: De Buyst, Benoot, Ewan, De Gendt, Keukeleire, Kluge, Monfort, Wellens MITCHELTON-SCOTT Australian outfit with the best social media game in the business \u2013 their Backstage Pass videos are required viewing during Grand Tours \u2013 and a young, hungry lineup. Simon Yates, winner of the Vuelta last year, was a little disappointing in the Giro but his brother Adam will get the nod here with Simon in support. Main man: Adam Yates Was right in the mix last year until he took a battering in the Alps \u2013 he lost 28 minutes to the other GC contenders on Alpe d\u2019Huez. Picked himself up to ride in support of his brother at the Vuelta and, with a fine season so far under his belt (second in Volta a Catalunya, fifth at the Tour of the Basque Country, fourth at Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge) he\u2019ll be eyeing the podium at least. Off the bike New Zealander Jack Bauer (omitted from the squad) used to play bass in a band called Dream Farm. Squad: A Yaes, S Yates, Haig, Durbridge, Hepburn, Juul-Jensen, Impey, Trentin MOVISTAR Seem set to head into the Tour with a trident of team leaders \u2013 Mikel Landa, Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde. The plan also seemed to get Movistar there or thereabouts \u2013the trio were 7th, 10th and 14th respectively in the 2018 Tour \u2013 but not to the top of the podium, but that changed at the Giro when Richard Carapaz bagged the pink jersey after starting as a Landa lieutenant. Main man: Nairo Quintana Has three TDF podium finishes, and wins in the Giro and Vuelta behind him but has found himself under the wheels of the Sky train in recent years. May be boosted more than most by the absence of his bete noire, Chris Froome. Off the bike Winner Anacona\u2019s father was a cycling fan and wanted to name his son after Dutch champion Peter Winnen. However, there was a typo on the birth certificate. \u201cHe realised it, but he liked the sound of the name,\u201d says Anacona Jr. Squad: TBC SUNWEB The German team\u2019s buildup has not exactly gone smoothly. Tom Dumoulin was out, then in, then out again, having failed to recover from the knee injury he suffered at the Giro. His absence means the GC podium is out of reach but it will allow the team to pour their energies into Michael Matthews\u2019 quest to wrench the green jersey from Peter Sagan. Main man: Michael Matthews The Australian took green when Sagan was kicked off the Tour in 2017 and is probably the best placed to challenge the Slovakian again. Off the bike Giro time-trial winner and committed Christian Chad Haga has a tattoo on his forearm that reads: \u201cEternity gained, only life remains.\u201d Squad: Andersen, Arndt, Bol, Haga, K\u00e4mna, Kelderman, Matthews, Roche TOTAL DIRECT \u00c9NERGIE Direct \u00c9nergie (the one-time Europcar team) have added a bit of petrol money to their sponsorship but there\u2019ll be a notable absentee \u2013 this Tour will be the first since 2000 without Sylvan Chavanel, who rode his last race for the team in October. With no realistic GC hope or sprint star, breakaways and stage wins will be the goal. Main man: Lilian Calmejane Won a stage in 2017 and has 35th and 30th place finishes in his two Tours to date. Another stage win will be the goal and perhaps cracking the top 20. Off the bike In his early 20s, Calmejane spent four months in Nottingham studying business. Squad: TBC TREK-SEGAFREDO It\u2019s not really happened for the team who burst on to the scene, armed with a couple of Schlecks, amid much fanfare in 2011. This time new signing Richie Porte is the great hope. He has a strong team around him, though: Bauke Mollema has three top-10 finishes to his name, while Koen de Kort, Toms Skujins and Jasper Stuyven are capable riders. Sprinter John Degenkolb is likely to be left out with the team putting all their energies into the GC battle. Main man: Richie Porte Perhaps the unluckiest man in the peloton after crashes in 2017 and 2018, and with Vincenzo Nibali joining the team next year, the Australian may be feeling time is running out. Off the bike Bauke Mollema got into cycling after riding 12km to school, where he \u201cconcentrated in ancient language and culture, especially Roman\u201d. Squad: Porte, Bernard, Ciccone, De Kort, Felline, Mollema, Skujins, Stuyven UAE TEAM EMIRATES A fascinating lineup with the absence of Fernando Gaviria offset by the return of Fabio Aru. Dan Martin will be optimistic about bettering his eighth-place finish in 2018, while Sergio Henao and Rui Costa provide experienced support. Alexander Kristoff will look to challenge Peter Sagan for the green jersey. Main man: Dan Martin Comes into the race on the back of three successive top 10 finishes in the Tour. Has the team around him to aim at a podium place this time. Off the bike Martin, a lover of fine food, is part-owner of a restaurant chain in London called Frog. Squad: Aru, Bystr\u00f8m, Costa, Henao, Kristoff, Laengen, Martin, Philipsen WANTY-GOBERT Belgian team in their third tour and with the classic wildcard playbook \u2013 get a man in every break and hope for the best. They do, though, have a rising star in the 25-year-old Guillaume Martin, who has finished just outside the top 20 in his two Tours to date and was third in the white jersey classification last year. Main man: Guillaume Martin The young Frenchman outclimbed some big names in the Alps last year. Next step will be a stage win. Off the bike Bart De Clercq was a decent cross-country runner but had to give up the sport due to shin problems. Squad: TBC",

      "body": "<p>Moments after losing a tight, gruelling first-round battle in the qualifying rounds of Wimbledon, Alexandra Cadantu silently exited the court alone, her head bowed and eyes clenched shut. She settled on a towel in the middle of the vast Roehampton field and picked up her phone to speak to her loved ones.</p> \n<p>As the 29-year-old admitted, this was actually one of her least lonely losses in recent years \u2013 her father and manager had travelled to London and they were waiting in the wings to comfort her. But for every other week in the year, with her ranking of 205, the Romanian has no choice but to travel the world and suffer bitter defeats alone.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the ATP player council met at Wimbledon to discuss prize money, the need to push tennis\u2019s institutions to be more transparent over revenue and to better distribute money through the tiers of the game. Sergiy Stakhovsky, a member of the ATP council competing in Roehampton, places the onus on the ATP events rather than the slams.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor a lot of guys, the money is an issue,\u201d he says. \u201cI do believe that the grand slams made a significant step in the right direction. I think that now it\u2019s the turn of our own tour to make better conditions for the rest. The grand slams, they have increased [prize money] 300% in the past six years, which is a significant step. But the Tour didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/wimbledon-2019-contenders-barty-osaka-djokovic-federer-nadal\">Wimbledon men\u2019s and women\u2019s form guide: the players to watch in SW19</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In recent weeks the public debates over earning a living have focused on the men\u2019s game and, while women enjoy equal pay at the slams, their plight lower down the rankings has been less visible. Cadantu was once a top-100 player dreaming of an even greater future. From 2011, she made the cut three years in a row. She climbed to a career high of world No 59 in 2014, but by the end of the year had to start over again after severe injuries including a six-centimetre abdominal rupture and surgery for a deviated septum.</p> \n<p>Injured tennis players earn nothing, yet Cadantu had a coach to pay and bills to settle. She rushed back. Her body was vulnerable, so she quickly fell into a vicious circle of injuries. She would enter a series of tournaments, but after the first event her arms and legs would scream for mercy. Her ranking collapsed but the urge to play through the pain and recover losses locked her into the cycle. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing a top player who has money or a sponsor would not do. But in my case I had to go because maybe I would win some money,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>The world No 115 Ysaline Bonaventure qualified at Roehampton for the main draw at Wimbledon \u2013 and a guaranteed \u00a345,000 even if she goes out in the first round. The 24-year-old Belgian explains that injured players are essentially working for free: \u201cIt is tough. You have to practise, you still have to pay your coaches, you have to pay the rent of your apartment. You have to pay a lot of things. It is tough that we don\u2019t have any backup when we are injured.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vasek Pospisil, a member of the ATP player council whose ranking has fallen from 73 to 188 after eight months out with injury, recently suggested that it costs him $300,000-$400,000 per year to travel with a coach and physio for 30 weeks. Cadantu has travelled to 13 different tournaments this year, including three different trips to Asia where the easier competition offers more opportunities but costs more. Until Wimbledon, she had only earned $16,913 (\u00a313,322).</p> \n<p>The drastic disparity in prize money between tournaments only adds further pressure, with a player\u2019s performance at the four slams defining whether they will earn enough money for the year or suffocate in debt. Cadantu earned a paltry $126 (\u00a399) after winning a qualifying round in a low-tier event in Singapore this January, while she would have matched Bonaventure\u2019s \u00a345k with three at Roehampton.</p> \n<p>Cadantu\u2019s struggles pushed her to the edge and she eventually set up a GoFundMe in August last year, asking fans to help her return to where she once was. \u201cEverything is difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to travel yourself and it\u2019s not easy when everyone else is with coaches, physios and a team [and] you have to manage yourself, to think all the time about the flight tickets and how to get the cheapest hotels or food.\u201d</p> \n<p>Across the Roehampton grounds, the 27-year-old Danielle Lao sliced her way through to the final qualifying round for the first time. Unlike most of her peers, Lao\u2019s journey began after an illustrious college tennis career at the University of South Carolina. In college, tennis is a team sport and as Lao transitioned to the tour, she struggled with both the responsibility and the reality of being alone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"505499f7dd080e13f543cc6a129c0b8c269a2839\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/505499f7dd080e13f543cc6a129c0b8c269a2839/0_27_4824_2894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Lao\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danielle Lao initially paid her coach with lunch each day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With her degree in communications and business, there was the promise of a far more lucrative job if she really wanted it. She did not, at least not yet. Instead, Lao was so broke when she started that she could not afford a coach. In the end, the American met with her childhood coach, Kal Moranon, and they came to an agreement.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe said: \u2018You still have a love for the game and I want to help you out, so let\u2019s finish this. You don\u2019t have to pay me until you make money. So come, let\u2019s hit balls, let\u2019s work on your game and then we can get lunch.\u2019\u201d And so, for the first few years, Lao paid her coach with lunch. Without him, she says, her professional career probably wouldn\u2019t have left the ground.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"71a04290-c8da-4884-bcd5-899df083e8b9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is the new format? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The All English Lawn Tennis Club announced in October 2018 that it would introduce a final-set tie-break when the score reached 12-12. It means an end to the drama of matches such as the record John Isner v Nicolas Mahut match in 2010, which ended 70-68 as they battled to win by the old rule of two games ahead in the final set.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why did they make the change? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the dramatic 26-24 semi-final final set between Kevin Anderson and Isner last year, with the whole match lasting 6hr 36min, Anderson struggled in the final, losing 6\u20132, 6\u20132, 7\u20136 to Novak Djokovic. After talking to players and reviewing match data Wimbledon decided to make the change. There were also scheduling complexities \u2013 the women\u2019s final between Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber was delayed by more than two hours when the other men\u2019s semi-final was pushed into Saturday as a result of the Anderson\u2011Isner match.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How do the majors compare?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Wimbledon singles matches will still be able to go longer than those at the US and Australian Opens, with the latter this year joining the New York event in going to a tie-break at 6-6, as in any other set. However, Wimbledon will use the standard first-to-seven tie-break, while Melbourne opted for the first-to-10 format, used in doubles in place of a final set (as with Andy Murray\u2019s recent Queen\u2019s semi-final victory alongside Feliciano L\u00f3pez). France are still holding on to the traditional rules, meaning they can, in theory, go on indefinitely in singles matches (doubles matches employ a final-set tie\u2011break). Beno\u00eet Paire and Pierre-Hughes Herbert won 11-9 in the fifth at Roland Garros last month, playing 4 hours 33 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Has the decision been received well?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Anderson, who suggested changes in his post-match interview, has welcomed it as \u201ca good compromise\u201d. Greg Rusedski, though, believes all tie-breaks should be triggered at 6-6. He said: \u201cIt creates more drama and players will be less tired for the next round.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>But weren\u2019t the epic matches part of the Wimbledon fairytale? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Even Andy Murray admitted it was a struggle to sit through Isner\u2011Anderson. In fact, only 15 singles matches have gone past 12-12 in the final set at Wimbledon in the past two decades. But under the new rule we would have been denied such classics as Roger Federer v Andy Roddick in the 2009 final, when Federer won the final set 16-14.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So many promising players are scuppered by financial ruin. For Lao, the past five years have seen a long, steady arc of improvement. At 5ft 3in and 115lb, the Californian is tiny and slight.</p> \n<p>She calls herself \u201cThe Little Giant\u201d, a constant reminder to play bigger than she is, to be more creative. \u201cEverything needs to be a bit more perfect [for me],\u201d she explains. \u201cI have to hit clean. There\u2019s really not too much room for error for me. If I hit the ball a little off centre, I\u2019m going to miss it because there\u2019s just so much power behind their ball.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her time on the practice court has been spent building a game to counter power with slice, spin and the wherewithal to outthink opponents attempting to bludgeon her off the court.</p> \n<p>In the summer of 2016, Lao considered retirement. She was not improving, injuries were constant and she was haemorrhaging money. In December 2017, she flew to Australia anticipating that enough players would withdraw for her to make the cut for the qualifying draw at the next year\u2019s first grand slam. She missed it by one spot, and as the alternate had to watch other players win and lose as she earned nothing. For Lao, aside from it funding much of her year, the utility of slam first-round prize money is that it allows her to travel more with her coach. For Cadantu the struggle goes on alone.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Moments after losing a tight, gruelling first-round battle in the qualifying rounds of Wimbledon, Alexandra Cadantu silently exited the court alone, her head bowed and eyes clenched shut. She settled on a towel in the middle of the vast Roehampton field and picked up her phone to speak to her loved ones. As the 29-year-old admitted, this was actually one of her least lonely losses in recent years \u2013 her father and manager had travelled to London and they were waiting in the wings to comfort her. But for every other week in the year, with her ranking of 205, the Romanian has no choice but to travel the world and suffer bitter defeats alone. On Friday, the ATP player council met at Wimbledon to discuss prize money, the need to push tennis\u2019s institutions to be more transparent over revenue and to better distribute money through the tiers of the game. Sergiy Stakhovsky, a member of the ATP council competing in Roehampton, places the onus on the ATP events rather than the slams. \u201cFor a lot of guys, the money is an issue,\u201d he says. \u201cI do believe that the grand slams made a significant step in the right direction. I think that now it\u2019s the turn of our own tour to make better conditions for the rest. The grand slams, they have increased [prize money] 300% in the past six years, which is a significant step. But the Tour didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d In recent weeks the public debates over earning a living have focused on the men\u2019s game and, while women enjoy equal pay at the slams, their plight lower down the rankings has been less visible. Cadantu was once a top-100 player dreaming of an even greater future. From 2011, she made the cut three years in a row. She climbed to a career high of world No 59 in 2014, but by the end of the year had to start over again after severe injuries including a six-centimetre abdominal rupture and surgery for a deviated septum. Injured tennis players earn nothing, yet Cadantu had a coach to pay and bills to settle. She rushed back. Her body was vulnerable, so she quickly fell into a vicious circle of injuries. She would enter a series of tournaments, but after the first event her arms and legs would scream for mercy. Her ranking collapsed but the urge to play through the pain and recover losses locked her into the cycle. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing a top player who has money or a sponsor would not do. But in my case I had to go because maybe I would win some money,\u201d she says. The world No 115 Ysaline Bonaventure qualified at Roehampton for the main draw at Wimbledon \u2013 and a guaranteed \u00a345,000 even if she goes out in the first round. The 24-year-old Belgian explains that injured players are essentially working for free: \u201cIt is tough. You have to practise, you still have to pay your coaches, you have to pay the rent of your apartment. You have to pay a lot of things. It is tough that we don\u2019t have any backup when we are injured.\u201d Vasek Pospisil, a member of the ATP player council whose ranking has fallen from 73 to 188 after eight months out with injury, recently suggested that it costs him $300,000-$400,000 per year to travel with a coach and physio for 30 weeks. Cadantu has travelled to 13 different tournaments this year, including three different trips to Asia where the easier competition offers more opportunities but costs more. Until Wimbledon, she had only earned $16,913 (\u00a313,322). The drastic disparity in prize money between tournaments only adds further pressure, with a player\u2019s performance at the four slams defining whether they will earn enough money for the year or suffocate in debt. Cadantu earned a paltry $126 (\u00a399) after winning a qualifying round in a low-tier event in Singapore this January, while she would have matched Bonaventure\u2019s \u00a345k with three at Roehampton. Cadantu\u2019s struggles pushed her to the edge and she eventually set up a GoFundMe in August last year, asking fans to help her return to where she once was. \u201cEverything is difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to travel yourself and it\u2019s not easy when everyone else is with coaches, physios and a team [and] you have to manage yourself, to think all the time about the flight tickets and how to get the cheapest hotels or food.\u201d Across the Roehampton grounds, the 27-year-old Danielle Lao sliced her way through to the final qualifying round for the first time. Unlike most of her peers, Lao\u2019s journey began after an illustrious college tennis career at the University of South Carolina. In college, tennis is a team sport and as Lao transitioned to the tour, she struggled with both the responsibility and the reality of being alone. With her degree in communications and business, there was the promise of a far more lucrative job if she really wanted it. She did not, at least not yet. Instead, Lao was so broke when she started that she could not afford a coach. In the end, the American met with her childhood coach, Kal Moranon, and they came to an agreement. \u201cHe said: \u2018You still have a love for the game and I want to help you out, so let\u2019s finish this. You don\u2019t have to pay me until you make money. So come, let\u2019s hit balls, let\u2019s work on your game and then we can get lunch.\u2019\u201d And so, for the first few years, Lao paid her coach with lunch. Without him, she says, her professional career probably wouldn\u2019t have left the ground. So many promising players are scuppered by financial ruin. For Lao, the past five years have seen a long, steady arc of improvement. At 5ft 3in and 115lb, the Californian is tiny and slight. She calls herself \u201cThe Little Giant\u201d, a constant reminder to play bigger than she is, to be more creative. \u201cEverything needs to be a bit more perfect [for me],\u201d she explains. \u201cI have to hit clean. There\u2019s really not too much room for error for me. If I hit the ball a little off centre, I\u2019m going to miss it because there\u2019s just so much power behind their ball.\u201d Her time on the practice court has been spent building a game to counter power with slice, spin and the wherewithal to outthink opponents attempting to bludgeon her off the court. In the summer of 2016, Lao considered retirement. She was not improving, injuries were constant and she was haemorrhaging money. In December 2017, she flew to Australia anticipating that enough players would withdraw for her to make the cut for the qualifying draw at the next year\u2019s first grand slam. She missed it by one spot, and as the alternate had to watch other players win and lose as she earned nothing. For Lao, aside from it funding much of her year, the utility of slam first-round prize money is that it allows her to travel more with her coach. For Cadantu the struggle goes on alone.",

Krantz was the \u201cqueen of the bonkbuster\u201d, those glitzy novels with their gaudy covers and snappy often one-word titles \u2013 <em>Scruples</em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/jun/11/shirley-conran-lace-feminist-bonkbuster\" title=\"\">Lace</a></em>, <em>Rivals</em> \u2013 that dominated commercial fiction in the late 1970s and 1980s, spinning stories of fabulous lives lived at full tilt and stuffed full of sex, secrets and shopping.</p> <p>As a teenager, I thrilled to those books: to Krantz\u2019s <em>Scruples</em>, in which her formidable heroine, Billy Ikehorn (nee Winthrop), essentially anticipated the hipster shopping experience by about two decades, opening the shop that gave the book its title, a perfect pleasuredome with an on-site bar in which women tried on shoes and sipped champagne while their husbands drank beer and played backgammon; to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/29/shirley-conran-interview-lace-republished\" title=\"\">Shirley Conran</a>\u2019s <em>Lace</em>, every 80s schoolgirl\u2019s most feverish fantasy (just ask them about the notorious goldfish scene), in which four women meet at an elite Swiss finishing school before going on to conquer the worlds of fashion, publishing, journalism and (more randomly) charity fundraising; and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jilly-cooper\" title=\"\">Jilly Cooper</a>\u2019s <em>Rivals</em>, which gave the genre a very British spin by having her heroes compete for an ITV franchise while fitting in the odd game of naked tennis.</p> <p>It might seem like a stretch to claim that everything I\u2019ve ever learned I learned from bonkbusters, and yet in an odd way it\u2019s true.</p> <p>Their initial appeal might lie in their almost fairytale glamour \u2013 there was a reason the late, great Jackie Collins set her books largely in Hollywood, where both the stakes and the stars were high. It was a chance to escape the humdrum reality of life \u2013 particularly teenage pre-internet life where the hours stretched on for days \u2013 by diving into a luxurious world filled with backstabbing and betrayal, where women were asked \u201cwhich one of you bitches is my mother?\u201d, and glamorous but down-at-heel progeny of white Russian princes-in-exile were forced to get ahead in advertising on their own.</p> <p>But behind all the Ritz and romance \u2013 Krantz\u2019s heroines in particular were fond of a good wedding or three \u2013 something more interesting was going on. Critics often sneer at these books as vacuous and stuffed full of \u201ctrivial\u201d concerns such as clothes, shoes and makeup (the wonderfully acerbic Angela Carter memorably described reading Krantz as like \u201cbeing sealed inside a luxury shopping mall whilst being softly pelted with scented sex technique manuals\u201d), yet they are also part of a rich tradition of novels which place women\u2019s interior lives and, most importantly, their sexual desires centre-stage, and, crucially, they are usually, although not always, at their heart about female friendship.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Underneath the froth, these were books written by women who understood the ways in which women\u2019s lives were changing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thus <em>Lace </em>might have a reputation as the steamiest bonkbuster of them all, a novel filled with lovingly described scenes of sex and masturbation, with erotic encounters with Swiss ski instructors, playboy princes and men about town, but no one ever really remembers the men. Instead, this is a book about the friendship between its four heroines, Maxine, Judy, Pagan and Kate, a friendship built around a secret child and intended to see them through thick and thin (or \u201csick and sin\u201d as the French Maxine rather more realistically has it).</p> <p>It is also a determinedly feminist book. Conran\u2019s real interest lies not in her heroine\u2019s marriages but in their careers, and she reserves her most lovingly detailed passages for those moments when Judy pulls off a publishing coup or Kate sneaks across the border into a war zone. Her teenage readers might have come for that goldfish but they left convinced that with the right combination of gumption and moxie and, more importantly, with the support of their friends, then any career was there for the taking.</p> <p>Similarly <em>Princess Daisy</em>, Krantz\u2019s second novel and my favourite, is as much about heroine Daisy\u2019s friendship with \u201cauto industry heiress\u201d Kiki Kavanaugh, always present with a quick quip, as it is about her desire to support and protect her twin sister Danielle, who suffered a brain injury during their birth. And while both Daisy and Kiki are heiresses, they are heiresses who work, with Daisy, estranged from her family thanks to her spectacularly evil half-brother Ram, paying Dani\u2019s medical bills by working as runner on a TV production company and painting society portraits on the side.</p> <p>For underneath the froth, these were books written by women who not only understood the ways in which women\u2019s lives were changing but who were eager to capture those changes on the page. Women such as Rona Jaffe, celebrated for her classic \u201cgirls in the city\u201d novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/28/best-everything-rona-jaffe-review\" title=\"\">The Best of Everything</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/28/best-everything-rona-jaffe-review\" title=\"\"> </a>(1958), who would go on to write 1979\u2019s <em>Class Reunion</em>, which followed four women from their time at Radcliffe College through bad marriages and by-and-large better careers to their college reunion 20 years later. And Lisa Alther, whose <em>Kinflicks</em>, published in 1976, told the riotous coming-of-age of Ginny Babcock, teen renegade turned sorority sister, lesbian, suburban mother and more.</p> <p>As the 80s progressed, so the bonkbuster began to spread in different directions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/barbara-taylor-bradford\" title=\"\">Barbara Taylor Bradford</a> created the self-made woman par excellence with <em>A Woman of Substance</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/28/penny-vincenzi-obituary\" title=\"\">Penny Vincenzi</a> combined tight plots with a flair for characterisation in a string of hits from <em>Old Sins</em> to <em>A Question of Trust,</em> and June Flaum Singer threw the kitchen sink at it with <em>The Movie Set</em>, which came with the irresistible tagline \u201cThey started out as five nice girls, but nice girls don\u2019t survive in The Movie Set\u201d. Best of all, perhaps, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/12/sally-beauman-obituary\" title=\"\">Sally Beauman</a>, who hit the headlines when her debut <em>Destiny</em>, a racy sex-stuffed tale of forbidden love, was the subject of a million-pound advance, and who would go on to write <em>Dark Angel</em>, an addictive blend of family house saga, mystery and secret desires which offered new possibilities for the genre.</p> <p>But its queens saw no need to change. Krantz gave us <em>I\u2019ll Take Manhattan</em>, in which Maxi Amberville, who at 29 \u201chas already discarded three husbands on two continents\u201d, bends the magazine industry to her will, Collins introduced the all-conquering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/sep/21/top-five-jackie-collins-novels\" title=\"\">Lucky Santangelo</a>, mob daughter and Lady Boss long before the notion was an internet meme, and Cooper turned her eye to the worlds of polo, music and art while still ensuring that her heroes and heroines were only ever one sultry Cotswold evening away from stripping off and getting to it.</p> <p>And that perhaps was the lesson that the best bonkbusters delivered. There\u2019s none of the fey whimpering from the shadows of a <em>Fifty Shades</em> here, instead \u2013 whether writing about friendships, work or sex \u2013 these books celebrated women. They told their audience that those relationships, careers and desires were both worthwhile and wonderful, and they made their readers feel they could be wonderful too. They weren\u2019t perfect by any means, \u2013 many have a near-pathological obsession with \u201cthe perfect weight\u201d and there are crude insults that jar on re-reads \u2013 but the greatest of them, from Beauman and Conran to Vincenzi and Taylor Bradford, tell women not to hide in the shadows but to stand proudly centre stage. It is for that confidence \u2013 or as a bonkbuster heroine would have it, that brio \u2013 that Krantz in particular will be missed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"73112b3ea4edd191f7a03541e68053337623251e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73112b3ea4edd191f7a03541e68053337623251e/33_79_300_375/300.jpg\" alt=\"Valley of the Dolls by Jacqueline Susann\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valley of the Dolls by Jacqueline Susann.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Page turners</h2> <h2>Valley of the Dolls</h2> <p><strong>Jaqueline Susann</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>1966</strong><br>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t write, she types\u201d bitched Gore Vidal, but Susann\u2019s Hollywood tale is an unputdownable story of fame, excess and addiction.</p> <h2>Scruples</h2> <p><strong>Judith Krantz</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>1978</strong><br>Krantz\u2019s debut tells of ugly duckling Billy Winthrop and her rise to fashion glory thanks to \u2026 weight loss, secretarial skills and the decision to open luxury shop Scruples.</p> <h2>The Debutantes</h2> <p><strong>June Flaum Singer, 1982</strong><br>Flaum Singer drew loose inspiration from the life of the late Gloria Vanderbilt in this over-the-top story of four close friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"29b43aafc51737be497c1f40b6d69bbc06363834\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b43aafc51737be497c1f40b6d69bbc06363834/0_0_293_500/293.jpg\" alt=\"Lace by Shirley Conran\" width=\"293\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lace by Shirley Conran</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lace</h2> <p><strong>Shirley Conran, 1984</strong><br>Famous for its opening \u2013 \u201cwhich one of you bitches is my mother?\u201d \u2013 Conran\u2019s tale is really a feminist saga of friendship and ambition.</p> <h2>Sundowners</h2> <p><strong>Lesley Lokko, 2003</strong><br>Lokko dragged the blockbuster into the 21st century with this addictive story of four boarding school friends which mixes astute commentary on race and politics amid the glamour.</p>",

Krantz was the \u201cqueen of the bonkbuster\u201d, those glitzy novels with their gaudy covers and snappy often one-word titles \u2013 Scruples, Lace, Rivals \u2013 that dominated commercial fiction in the late 1970s and 1980s, spinning stories of fabulous lives lived at full tilt and stuffed full of sex, secrets and shopping.

It might seem like a stretch to claim that everything I\u2019ve ever learned I learned from bonkbusters, and yet in an odd way it\u2019s true. Their initial appeal might lie in their almost fairytale glamour \u2013 there was a reason the late, great Jackie Collins set her books largely in Hollywood, where both the stakes and the stars were high.

Thus Lace might have a reputation as the steamiest bonkbuster of them all, a novel filled with lovingly described scenes of sex and masturbation, with erotic encounters with Swiss ski instructors, playboy princes and men about town, but no one ever really remembers the men. Instead, this is a book about the friendship between its four heroines, Maxine, Judy, Pagan and Kate, a friendship built around a secret child and intended to see them through thick and thin (or \u201csick and sin\u201d as the French Maxine rather more realistically has it).

Her teenage readers might have come for that goldfish but they left convinced that with the right combination of gumption and moxie and, more importantly, with the support of their friends, then any career was there for the taking. Similarly Princess Daisy, Krantz\u2019s second novel and my favourite, is as much about heroine Daisy\u2019s friendship with \u201cauto industry heiress\u201d Kiki Kavanaugh, always present with a quick quip, as it is about her desire to support and protect her twin sister Danielle, who suffered a brain injury during their birth.

And Lisa Alther, whose Kinflicks, published in 1976, told the riotous coming-of-age of Ginny Babcock, teen renegade turned sorority sister, lesbian, suburban mother and more. As the 80s progressed, so the bonkbuster began to spread in different directions. Barbara Taylor Bradford created the self-made woman par excellence with A Woman of Substance, Penny Vincenzi combined tight plots with a flair for characterisation in a string of hits from Old Sins to A Question of Trust, and June Flaum Singer threw the kitchen sink at it with The Movie Set, which came with the irresistible tagline \u201cThey started out as five nice girls, but nice girls don\u2019t survive in The Movie Set\u201d. Best of all, perhaps, was Sally Beauman, who hit the headlines when her debut Destiny, a racy sex-stuffed tale of forbidden love, was the subject of a million-pound advance, and who would go on to write Dark Angel, an addictive blend of family house saga, mystery and secret desires which offered new possibilities for the genre. But its queens saw no need to change. Krantz gave us I\u2019ll Take Manhattan, in which Maxi Amberville, who at 29 \u201chas already discarded three husbands on two continents\u201d, bends the magazine industry to her will, Collins introduced the all-conquering Lucky Santangelo, mob daughter and Lady Boss long before the notion was an internet meme, and Cooper turned her eye to the worlds of polo, music and art while still ensuring that her heroes and heroines were only ever one sultry Cotswold evening away from stripping off and getting to it. And that perhaps was the lesson that the best bonkbusters delivered.

Scruples Judith Krantz, 1978 Krantz\u2019s debut tells of ugly duckling Billy Winthrop and her rise to fashion glory thanks to \u2026 weight loss, secretarial skills and the decision to open luxury shop Scruples. The Debutantes June Flaum Singer, 1982 Flaum Singer drew loose inspiration from the life of the late Gloria Vanderbilt in this over-the-top story of four close friends. Lace Shirley Conran, 1984 Famous for its opening \u2013 \u201cwhich one of you bitches is my mother?\u201d \u2013 Conran\u2019s tale is really a feminist saga of friendship and ambition.

Only chumps who believe in a democratic contest of ideas go in for such foolishness.</p> <p>For example, Morrison told the <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/wa-chamber-commerce-and-industry-address\">Western Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a> that he wanted \u201cto take a fresh look at how the [industrial relations] system is operating and where there may be impediments to shared gains for employers and employees\u201d.</p> <p>This issue was not mentioned once in his election <a href=\"https://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2019/05/12/coalition-campaign-launch\">campaign launch speech</a> in May.

      "bodyText": "This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, decided that with the election out of the way, he should now tell the country what he proposes doing for the next three years. It really is a lot easier to do this way, without having to go through the bother of persuading voters about your policies\u2019 worth. Only chumps who believe in a democratic contest of ideas go in for such foolishness. For example, Morrison told the Western Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry that he wanted \u201cto take a fresh look at how the [industrial relations] system is operating and where there may be impediments to shared gains for employers and employees\u201d. This issue was not mentioned once in his election campaign launch speech in May. The fact that Morrison wants to talk up changes to industrial relations only after the votes have been cast and counted is a rather obvious way of showing contempt for voters. Admittedly most of his speech contained little new \u2013 it was just a rehash of mindless nothingness that he had uttered during his time as treasurer \u2013 serving the soggy, barely reheated meal of red tape and bracket creep to the chamber of commerce diners, who lapped it up like the docile audience they were required to be. Red tape and bracket creep are terms that allow you to ignore whoever mentions them with minimal fear of missing out on any intelligent points. Like other phrases such as \u201cbaseload power\u201d and \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d, the speaker generally is either ignorant or purposefully misleading you. Morrison argued that the ALP needed to pass all the government\u2019s tax cut plans, including the one to flatten income tax rates so that the marginal tax rate for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 would be 32.5%. This, he suggested, \u201cis an important change for the future, to banish the bandit of bracket creep\u201d. What crap. Bracket creep is where despite doing the same job, a pay rise takes your income into a higher marginal tax bracket. Some economists like to argue that this is a great disincentive to work; but mostly they overstate it, and all agree that the biggest disincentive is for lower income earners \u2013 because small increases in tax matter more for someone on $30,000 than someone on $130,000. In reality, the big disincentive to extra work is not bracket creep but the interaction of income with other costs and government payments \u2013 such as childcare and the family tax benefit \u2013 where earning more can result in your actual disposable income dropping because you lose out on benefits and have to pay for childcare. That is not so much of an issue for people earning $88,000, who because of a pay rise will earn $91,000, and thus see $1,000 of their income now taxed at 37% because it has crossed the $90,000 threshold. And someone on $45,000 sure as hell is not worried about getting such a big pay rise that they would now earn more than $90,000. Paying a higher marginal tax rate because you get a higher paying job is also not bracket creep \u2013 it is progressive taxation. It is a system so designed because of the reality that someone on $180,000 can afford to give up a greater percentage of their income to tax than someone on $45,000. If you really want to take care of bracket creep, you would index all income tax thresholds to average earnings, and have them changed automatically every three to five years. The purpose of Morrison\u2019s flat tax policy is not to rid us of bracket creep, but to reduce income tax \u2013 and to reduce it most for high income earners. Research by the parliamentary budget office shows that the top 10% of income earners get 31% of the total benefits from the stage 3 tax cuts. As I noted after the budget, stage 3 of the tax cuts delivers those earning $200,000 a 4.54% tax reduction, while those on $60,000 get a cut of just 0.6%. So don\u2019t be fooled into thinking it is a policy designed in any way to help those on median incomes. It is a policy which, the Grattan Institute has found, will make our tax system much less progressive. In his speech, Morrison also talked about the evils of red tape, suggesting an example of a better time as when \u201cin 1966, the late Sir Arvi Parbo took the Kambalda nickel mine near Kalgoorlie from discovery to operation in 18 months\u201d. He contrasted this with \u201cthe Roy Hill iron ore mine [which] took around 10 years to complete around 4,000 approvals\u201d. The year 1966 is an interesting one to pick \u2013 it coincidentally was the year the Wittenoom blue asbestos mine stopped production \u2013 not because of red tape but falling profitability. It says something that our prime minister wishes for a time when mining regulations were so lax that not only could you basically destroy the environment, you could also mine asbestos with impunity. The thing about red tape is that it sounds like a bother, but when for example an apartment building starts developing cracks, the first thing people want to know is whether or not the building standards (ie red tape) were adhered to, or if they need to be raised. Banking regulations for example prevented Australia\u2019s financial system from collapsing as did those in the US and UK during the global financial crisis. The history of capitalism shows that when businesses are allowed to reduce red tape, consumers and the economy eventually lose out, because businesses profit from not having to do things that consumers don\u2019t know need to be done. Our prime minister appears to cheer for such an outcome. And so now after the election, we see Morrison\u2019s economic vision \u2013 changes to industrial relations, businesses coming up with ideas on which regulations they no longer want to adhere to, and, as ever, the desire to cut taxes for the wealthiest. Pity. That would have made for an interesting election campaign.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cHave you seen those two guys on YouTube? They\u2019re fantastic!\u201d The word got round last year about <a href=\"https://lejazzetal.com/the-complete-morton-project2/\" title=\"\">pianist Andrew Oliver and clarinettist David Horniblow</a>, who had set themselves the apparently lunatic task of learning all the 94 compositions of Ferdinand \u201cJelly Roll\u201d Morton and recording and posting videos of the whole lot by the end of 2018. Not only did they succeed, their playing was so dynamic and heartfelt that I really missed them when they\u2019d finished.</p> <p>I thought I knew Morton, the first jazz composer, pretty well, but some of what these two had played was quite new to me. More important, their approach, although perfectly authentic in style, had a freshness and immediacy that was all their own. These 15 numbers, rerecorded in a proper studio, with a concert piano, make an impressive selection from a fascinating life\u2019s work.</p> <p>Morton (1890-1941) started out playing ragtime in New Orleans brothels, becoming a popular bandleader and recording artist in the 1920s, only to fall out of fashion in later life. Nowadays he tends to get patronisingly labelled as \u201cearly jazz\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHave you seen those two guys on YouTube? They\u2019re fantastic!\u201d The word got round last year about pianist Andrew Oliver and clarinettist David Horniblow, who had set themselves the apparently lunatic task of learning all the 94 compositions of Ferdinand \u201cJelly Roll\u201d Morton and recording and posting videos of the whole lot by the end of 2018. Not only did they succeed, their playing was so dynamic and heartfelt that I really missed them when they\u2019d finished. I thought I knew Morton, the first jazz composer, pretty well, but some of what these two had played was quite new to me. More important, their approach, although perfectly authentic in style, had a freshness and immediacy that was all their own. These 15 numbers, rerecorded in a proper studio, with a concert piano, make an impressive selection from a fascinating life\u2019s work. Morton (1890-1941) started out playing ragtime in New Orleans brothels, becoming a popular bandleader and recording artist in the 1920s, only to fall out of fashion in later life. Nowadays he tends to get patronisingly labelled as \u201cearly jazz\u201d. These spirited and accomplished performances bring his music vividly to life.",

Prior to AHMM\u2019s scheme, alternative strategies for decanting involved consigning MPs to the regions, and two entirely speculative proposals for a floating parliament moored next to the Palace of Westminster, one provocatively featuring a trio of redundant Woolwich ferries to create a \u201cHouseboat of Commons\u201d.</p> <p>More to the point, the AHMM scheme faithfully retains the adversarial oblong, which appears simply cut and pasted into renderings of the interior, as if the functioning of British political life is entirely contingent on talismanic rows of green leather benches. Doubtless MPs will find it comforting, a green leather umbilicus connecting them with the ailing mothership, but it does seem like another missed opportunity to experiment with alternative layouts and explore different ways of conducting debate. Both the devolved <a href=\"http://www.mirallestagliabue.com/project/scottish-parliament-building/\" title=\"\">Scottish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rsh-p.com/projects/national-assembly-for-wales/\" title=\"\">Welsh</a> parliaments have embraced the continental hemicycle without mishap, and the tone of their encounters seems more civilised for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dda8f6cda880a46f4564f36262eab41d02cfe6dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dda8f6cda880a46f4564f36262eab41d02cfe6dd/0_0_2808_1300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One speculative proposal, above, was for a floating parliament moored alongside the Palace of Westminster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"463\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One speculative proposal, above, was for a floating parliament moored alongside the Palace of Westminster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Gensler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dilemma of what to do with tottering parliament buildings is by no means confined to Britain. Austria, Finland and the Netherlands are currently grappling with similar issues, but their experiences cannot match either the level of expense or intensity of feeling engulfing Westminster. Going further back, one conspicuous exemplar is the 1999 reconstruction of the former Reichstag in Berlin to accommodate Germany\u2019s parliament following unification. In an extraordinary act of patronage unthinkable here, leading British architect Norman Foster was selected for<a href=\"https://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/reichstag-new-german-parliament/\" title=\"\"> the remodelling</a>. Foster squared up to the building\u2019s carcass with characteristic technocratic bombast, but it is the more intimate details, such as <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/soviet-graffiti-reichstag\" title=\"\">the graffiti</a> scrawled on the walls by victorious Russian soldiers and now preserved for posterity, that speak most eloquently of the building and its contested place in German history.</p> <p>Hopelessly infatuated with a Victorian vision of itself, Britain seems set on the opposite course, committed to painstakingly licking Barry and Pugin\u2019s decaying wedding cake back into shape. But once MPs get a taste of working life beyond the aspic confines of the palace\u2019s 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases, 31 lifts and three miles of corridors, the genie might well be out of the bottle and they may never return. \u201cWe shape our buildings and then they shape us,\u201d Churchill famously said when advocating the postwar rebuilding that kept things exactly the same. But the more things stay the same, the more they probably need to change.</p>",

For centuries, the UK\u2019s two-party system has been perpetuated in a cramped, adversarial chamber, sustained by an armature of bewilderingly arcane rituals, but as political power ebbs from Westminster and its familiar landscape begins to atomise in the gravitational pull of Brexit, what constitutes a modern and cogent architectural expression of British parliamentary democracy? The recent unveiling of interim accommodation for 650 decanted MPs, who are to be shoehorned into Richmond House, the former Department of Health in Whitehall, for the anticipated eight-year duration of the palace\u2019s patching up, might point the way, but has attracted attention for all the wrong reasons. The officially sanctioned design by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM) involves gutting Richmond House while retaining its concertina-like facade, has simultaneously piqued traditionalists, who resent its air of bland managerialism, and irked modernists, who deplore the desecration of William Whitfield\u2019s 1987 \u201cmasterpiece of contextualism\u201d. Whitfield, who died in March aged 98, made a career out of recherche interventions \u2013 he has been described as the \u201cgo-to architect for cathedral deans\u201d \u2013 and, like Gilbert Scott, could turn his hand to many idioms. Richmond House is listed Grade II*, so battle looms between heritage bodies who would preserve Whitfield\u2019s building and the government. Prior to AHMM\u2019s scheme, alternative strategies for decanting involved consigning MPs to the regions, and two entirely speculative proposals for a floating parliament moored next to the Palace of Westminster, one provocatively featuring a trio of redundant Woolwich ferries to create a \u201cHouseboat of Commons\u201d. More to the point, the AHMM scheme faithfully retains the adversarial oblong, which appears simply cut and pasted into renderings of the interior, as if the functioning of British political life is entirely contingent on talismanic rows of green leather benches. Doubtless MPs will find it comforting, a green leather umbilicus connecting them with the ailing mothership, but it does seem like another missed opportunity to experiment with alternative layouts and explore different ways of conducting debate. Both the devolved Scottish and Welsh parliaments have embraced the continental hemicycle without mishap, and the tone of their encounters seems more civilised for it. The dilemma of what to do with tottering parliament buildings is by no means confined to Britain. Austria, Finland and the Netherlands are currently grappling with similar issues, but their experiences cannot match either the level of expense or intensity of feeling engulfing Westminster. Going further back, one conspicuous exemplar is the 1999 reconstruction of the former Reichstag in Berlin to accommodate Germany\u2019s parliament following unification. In an extraordinary act of patronage unthinkable here, leading British architect Norman Foster was selected for the remodelling. Foster squared up to the building\u2019s carcass with characteristic technocratic bombast, but it is the more intimate details, such as the graffiti scrawled on the walls by victorious Russian soldiers and now preserved for posterity, that speak most eloquently of the building and its contested place in German history. Hopelessly infatuated with a Victorian vision of itself, Britain seems set on the opposite course, committed to painstakingly licking Barry and Pugin\u2019s decaying wedding cake back into shape. But once MPs get a taste of working life beyond the aspic confines of the palace\u2019s 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases, 31 lifts and three miles of corridors, the genie might well be out of the bottle and they may never return. \u201cWe shape our buildings and then they shape us,\u201d Churchill famously said when advocating the postwar rebuilding that kept things exactly the same. But the more things stay the same, the more they probably need to change.",

      "body": "<p>On an early summer\u2019s evening on the outskirts of Basel \u2013 a city almost certainly in Switzerland, but sometimes in France and occasionally Germany \u2013 hundreds of well-heeled men and women stand in line, giddily, champagne flutes in hand, waiting to buy a \u00a3140 brick. It is, naturally, no ordinary brick. It\u2019s flag-down-a-passing-aircraft orange, and prominently branded in an edition of just 999. But, crucially, the brick \u2013 or \u201cceramic block\u201d as its parents have christened it \u2013 has been designed by Virgil Abloh, a 38-year-old from Chicago, in conjunction with the timeless Swiss furniture company <a href=\"https://www.vitra.com/en-gb/home\">Vitra</a>. Right now, Abloh is an alchemist: anything he touches in the worlds of fashion and design turns to gold (or often orange).

For those who are unconvinced by him, his main talents are in orchestrating hype and self-promotion. One of his often-quoted maxims is that you only need to change a design by 3% to make it fresh and original, and he made his name originally by applying this logic to graphic T-shirts, hoodies and sneakers. In <em><a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/my-son-the-prince-of-fashion\" title=\"\">GQ</a></em><a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/my-son-the-prince-of-fashion\" title=\"\">, the author Michael Chabon</a> described Abloh as \u201cone-third hip-hop, one-third hustle, one-third [Malcolm] McLarenesque inside joke\u201d.</p> <p>For others, though \u2013 and it\u2019s an army that is beginning to drown out the doubters \u2013 Abloh is nothing less than a new Marcel Duchamp, the Andy Warhol for our times. His work is reliably playful, ironic and totally unreverential: one of his signatures is to add a lurid zip-tie to Nike sneakers. In March, Justin Bieber was stopped by police, who thought he still had a store security tag on his Air Max 90s. \u201cVirgil, my God, bro,\u201d Bieber posted on Instagram. \u201cYou freaking \u2013 you\u2019re killing me, man!\u201d Other trademarks are horizontal stripes, quotation marks, brash capital letters in Helvetica type. You\u2019ll see them everywhere now: Kendall Jenner, Drake, Beyonc\u00e9, Serena Williams.</p> <p>Abloh is also a pioneer, a relentless polymath. In March 2018, he became <a href=\"https://uk.louisvuitton.com/eng-gb/la-maison/virgil-abloh#biography\" title=\"\">Louis Vuitton\u2019s first African-American artistic director</a>, and a rare black designer in the fashion establishment. His streetwear label <a href=\"https://www.off---white.com/en/GB\" title=\"\">Off-White</a>, founded in 2012, is neck and neck with Gucci as the \u201chottest\u201d brand in the world, according to the influential <a href=\"https://www.lyst.co.uk/the-lyst-index/2019/q1/\" title=\"\">Lyst Index</a>. He\u2019s lectured at Harvard and the Architectural Association in London, and had a series of exhibitions at the <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/\" title=\"\">Gagosian</a> galleries with cult artist <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/artists/takashi-murakami/\" title=\"\">Takashi Murakami</a>. The <em>New Yorker</em> recently called Abloh \u201cmenswear\u2019s biggest star\u201d; last year, <em>Time</em> named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c7973833a46daff6bd45c89b79ea325dcdf03d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7973833a46daff6bd45c89b79ea325dcdf03d48/0_118_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red alert: Louis Vuitton Menswear SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red alert: Louis Vuitton Menswear SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter White/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Abloh taps into is a generation \u2013 millennials, essentially \u2013 who, until recently, have been ignored as serious consumers. His reach is shown most conspicuously by his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/virgilabloh/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a> followers, of whom there are 4.1m. This makes him tremendously desirable for established companies looking for a jab of Botox. Ikea has commissioned him to design a range of products, available from November. When, in May, the homewares giant \u201cdropped\u201d a rug from the collection \u2013 a grey and black wool-nylon blend with \u201cKEEP OFF\u201d across the middle \u2013 it sold out in a finger-click.</p> <p>It\u2019s a version of this frenzy that I\u2019m witnessing at Vitra. The company \u2013 the European manufacturer of the designs of Charles and Ray Eames, Verner Panton and Jean Prouv\u00e9 \u2013 has worked with Abloh on three new designs: the ceramic block and two \u201chacks\u201d of classic Prouv\u00e9 designs, the Antony chair and the Petit Potence wall lamp. There\u2019s a commercial aspect to the collaboration but, for Abloh, that\u2019s not the most exciting part. He sees the Virgil Abloh c/o Vitra project as an opportunity to reach and inspire a young person \u2013 in his head, aged 14 to 17 \u2013 who has never heard of Prouv\u00e9 and probably has no interest in design.</p> <p>So it\u2019s a brick, sure, but maybe for the neophyte it\u2019s also a way into an intimidating, expensive world. \u201cDesign is often something the general public doesn\u2019t notice until it\u2019s broke,\u201d says Abloh. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice a door handle until it doesn\u2019t work. You don\u2019t think about the history related to architecture, cars or phones \u2013 you just use them. Whereas I think we would all benefit from having a knowledge of design. At least that\u2019s the premise that I operate under.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bcea1c54d6e97566db5e7e3610ff81cf1d18bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bcea1c54d6e97566db5e7e3610ff81cf1d18bac/0_169_1910_2385/801.jpg\" alt=\"Line judge: Serena Williams wears Virgil Abloh at the French Open.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Line judge: Serena Williams wears Virgil Abloh at the French Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Abloh is a big man</strong></em> with a gentle manner. He doesn\u2019t often crack a smile this afternoon, but you can tell when he\u2019s into an idea by the fact that his speech cadence, usually languid, quickens. He has offices in Paris, Milan and London, homes in Paris and Chicago, but no desk anywhere. His design work is mainly done on two phones that sit between us as we speak. I\u2019d love to say that our conversation is so compelling that they remain untouched, but that isn\u2019t the case. A sound engineer records our exchange for Abloh\u2019s \u201carchive\u201d.</p> <p>The Abloh story starts in suburban Rockford, Illinois in 1980. His mother Eunice and father Nee, Ghanaian immigrants to America in the 1970s, were respectively a seamstress and a manager of a paint company. As a teenager, Abloh was into skateboarding, soccer and graffiti but, looking back, his greatest inspiration was hip-hop. And he sees obvious parallels with critiques of his design work. \u201cHip-hop\u2019s a music form that\u2019s made by sampling a soul or jazz record and making a completely new genre,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could argue, \u2018Is it music or not?\u2019 But you can say now that it\u2019s the number one [genre] in music.\u201d</p> <p>Abloh is not, by most accepted definitions, actually a millennial himself: most have that category starting with a 1982 birthdate. Certainly his academic career followed a more traditional Generation X path. His parents wanted him to learn a trade, so he studied first civil engineering and then trained as an architect. His heroes were an eclectic crew: Kanye West, Rem Koolhaas, Pharrell Williams and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.</p> <p>The story goes that he engineered a meeting with West by finding out where the rapper screen-printed his merchandise in Chicago. Now, he says that they probably would have run into each other anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re from the same city, so it\u2019s a small circle.\u201d Either way, they clicked and, for a decade from the mid-2000s, they worked on projects together (Abloh is sometimes called West\u2019s creative director). When, in 2009, West decided to slum it as an intern at the fashion house Fendi in Rome for six months \u2013 with a salary of \u00a3400 a month \u2013 Abloh tagged along.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"912a05655bf793965c80dd4554676108ba10f7af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/912a05655bf793965c80dd4554676108ba10f7af/0_128_7605_4563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heron Preston show, Front Row, Spring Summer 2020, Paris Fashion Week Men\u2019s, France - 18 Jun 2019Mandatory Credit: Photo by Swan Gallet/WWD/REX/Shutterstock (10311772r) Virgil Abloh, Carine Roitfeld and Gigi Hadid in the front row Heron Preston show, Front Row, Spring Summer 2020, Paris Fashion Week Men\u2019s, France - 18 Jun 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fashion forward: with Carine Roitfeld and Gigi Hadid Paris Fashion Week Men\u2019s, June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Swan Gallet/WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not many make the jump from intern to artistic director, but Abloh\u2019s ascent tells you what a crazy journey the fashion industry has been on in the past few years. Today, under-35s drive more than 50% of the revenue at some of the top fashion labels and streetwear is mainstream. \u201cFor sure, I bet on it,\u201d he says. \u201cI made a career out of it. When I was showing in fashion week, people were saying, \u2018That\u2019s not fashion.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t referred to as a fashion designer.\u201d</p> <p>Abloh is sometimes described as a dilettante, but he points out that nothing he\u2019s achieved has been easy. \u201cMy career had been 15 years long and there\u2019s only been people paying attention for the last three,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this exact amount of work and type of work for a long time. It\u2019s the life of a designer and artist that not everything works, but when everyone\u2019s watching hopefully it\u2019s working.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>In 2019, everyone\u2019s</strong></em> watching, everything\u2019s working. On the day we meet, Abloh has flown into Switzerland from Chicago, where the Museum of Contemporary Art is staging <a href=\"https://www.mcachicago.org/Publications/Websites/Abloh\" title=\"\">a career-spanning retrospective</a>: he is, to confirm, 38 years old. His latest collections for Off-White and Louis Vuitton were presented at Paris Fashion Week this month (his LV jamboree, which featured floral harnesses, Arsenal\u2019s H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and a red bouncy castle, was \u201cthe standout show\u201d of the week, said <em>W Magazine</em>). He\u2019s had to finish off this project with Vitra and go back and forth with Ikea. Most of us, it\u2019s safe to say, wouldn\u2019t last five minutes as Virgil Abloh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d71eb60cc2b4e5a6a82cec9cfe31402804b8e969\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d71eb60cc2b4e5a6a82cec9cfe31402804b8e969/0_386_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s gotta be the shoes: Virgil Abloh\u2019s Off-White for Nike.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s gotta be the shoes: Virgil Abloh\u2019s Off-White for Nike</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reason for this punishing pace is that he loves what he does and perhaps knows that this is his time. \u201cI feel like now is a tremendous time in culture,\u201d he says, at the Vitra launch. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s the Renaissance. I feel like Bernini just sculpting away, defining a moment of enlightenment. I\u2019m just an eager kid who looks at every day as a possibility to make something and leave a good impact.\u201d</p> <p>Abloh\u2019s private life is mainly that \u2013 private \u2013 but we know he is married to Shannon Sundberg, whom he met in high school, and they have two young children, Lowe and Grey. It\u2019s been estimated that he\u2019s on the road 320 days a year \u2013 \u201ca myth,\u201d he counters \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t deny he has to be obsessive about his work. \u201cAny person you can cite: Steve Jobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Michael Jordan \u2013 they are not common names because they did it nine-to-five,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people on Earth that dedicate themselves to their practice or whatever. I\u2019ve always been like that.\u201d</p> <p>In his staff, Abloh looks for and expects a similar work ethic. At Vitra, he notes that he makes most of his hires straight from social media. \u201cIf you have an awesome Instagram, I\u2019ll follow you, DM you and say, \u2018Hey, do you want a job?\u2019 And if you are self-motivated, you\u2019re going to get promoted in two seconds because that\u2019s ultimately the shot I wanted when I was a kid.\u201d</p> <p>Working at this speed also means that Abloh doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about how people (especially trolls) are responding to what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s adamant that his gaze is set 30 years down the line, not at the comments on an Instagram post. As he puts it: \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for someone else to tell me what grade I get on it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was showing in fashion week, people were saying, \u2018That\u2019s not fashion\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And how does he feel about his work reselling for inflated multiples of their original price? Another shrug. \u201cLike on my list of things to worry about\u2026 I can\u2019t control it,\u201d Abloh replies. \u201cI\u2019m just the creator of the idea, the company is more in control.\u201d</p> <p>On the evidence of his Vitra project \u2013 whether Abloh is interested or not \u2013 he appears to have another hit. The range sold out in days, and it does seem to have initiated a conversation about design among a new crowd. At the end of a public talk he gave at the Vitra Campus, the stage was mobbed by teens and 20-somethings, many of whom were standing in their socks, thrusting up sneakers for Abloh to sign. \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star!\u201d says a design writer that I\u2019m sitting next to. It\u2019s definitely hard to think of another contemporary designer who would inspire such a response \u2013 even harder to name one who would later play a 90-minute DJ set, until 12.30am, at the Vitra summer party (unexpected highlight: Journey\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019.)</p> <p>Of course, Abloh\u2019s designs will likely never be for everyone \u2013 perhaps inevitably for someone who confronts, and affronts, the status quo so directly. At Basel airport the next day, I try to put one of his cinder blocks through the X-ray machine. The security officer looks bemused and pulls me aside for clarification. \u201cFran\u00e7ais, Deutsch, English?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I explain to him that it\u2019s a ceramic design object. He takes a knife, slices the tape on the cardboard packaging. I\u2019m travelling with a PR and he opens Abloh\u2019s Instagram page, showing the brick in situ. The image already has 40,000 likes. The security man\u2019s expression is unchanged: he picks up the brick, spins it around in his hand, puts it back and waves me through without comment.</p> <p><em>There will be another drop of Virgil Abloh c/o Vitra this </em><em>autumn</em><em>.

One of his often-quoted maxims is that you only need to change a design by 3% to make it fresh and original, and he made his name originally by applying this logic to graphic T-shirts, hoodies and sneakers. In GQ, the author Michael Chabon described Abloh as \u201cone-third hip-hop, one-third hustle, one-third [Malcolm] McLarenesque inside joke\u201d. For others, though \u2013 and it\u2019s an army that is beginning to drown out the doubters \u2013 Abloh is nothing less than a new Marcel Duchamp, the Andy Warhol for our times. His work is reliably playful, ironic and totally unreverential: one of his signatures is to add a lurid zip-tie to Nike sneakers. In March, Justin Bieber was stopped by police, who thought he still had a store security tag on his Air Max 90s. \u201cVirgil, my God, bro,\u201d Bieber posted on Instagram. \u201cYou freaking \u2013 you\u2019re killing me, man!\u201d Other trademarks are horizontal stripes, quotation marks, brash capital letters in Helvetica type. You\u2019ll see them everywhere now: Kendall Jenner, Drake, Beyonc\u00e9, Serena Williams. Abloh is also a pioneer, a relentless polymath. In March 2018, he became Louis Vuitton\u2019s first African-American artistic director, and a rare black designer in the fashion establishment. His streetwear label Off-White, founded in 2012, is neck and neck with Gucci as the \u201chottest\u201d brand in the world, according to the influential Lyst Index. He\u2019s lectured at Harvard and the Architectural Association in London, and had a series of exhibitions at the Gagosian galleries with cult artist Takashi Murakami. The New Yorker recently called Abloh \u201cmenswear\u2019s biggest star\u201d; last year, Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. What Abloh taps into is a generation \u2013 millennials, essentially \u2013 who, until recently, have been ignored as serious consumers. His reach is shown most conspicuously by his Instagram followers, of whom there are 4.1m. This makes him tremendously desirable for established companies looking for a jab of Botox. Ikea has commissioned him to design a range of products, available from November. When, in May, the homewares giant \u201cdropped\u201d a rug from the collection \u2013 a grey and black wool-nylon blend with \u201cKEEP OFF\u201d across the middle \u2013 it sold out in a finger-click. It\u2019s a version of this frenzy that I\u2019m witnessing at Vitra. The company \u2013 the European manufacturer of the designs of Charles and Ray Eames, Verner Panton and Jean Prouv\u00e9 \u2013 has worked with Abloh on three new designs: the ceramic block and two \u201chacks\u201d of classic Prouv\u00e9 designs, the Antony chair and the Petit Potence wall lamp. There\u2019s a commercial aspect to the collaboration but, for Abloh, that\u2019s not the most exciting part. He sees the Virgil Abloh c/o Vitra project as an opportunity to reach and inspire a young person \u2013 in his head, aged 14 to 17 \u2013 who has never heard of Prouv\u00e9 and probably has no interest in design. So it\u2019s a brick, sure, but maybe for the neophyte it\u2019s also a way into an intimidating, expensive world. \u201cDesign is often something the general public doesn\u2019t notice until it\u2019s broke,\u201d says Abloh. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice a door handle until it doesn\u2019t work. You don\u2019t think about the history related to architecture, cars or phones \u2013 you just use them. Whereas I think we would all benefit from having a knowledge of design. At least that\u2019s the premise that I operate under.\u201d Abloh is a big man with a gentle manner. He doesn\u2019t often crack a smile this afternoon, but you can tell when he\u2019s into an idea by the fact that his speech cadence, usually languid, quickens. He has offices in Paris, Milan and London, homes in Paris and Chicago, but no desk anywhere. His design work is mainly done on two phones that sit between us as we speak. I\u2019d love to say that our conversation is so compelling that they remain untouched, but that isn\u2019t the case. A sound engineer records our exchange for Abloh\u2019s \u201carchive\u201d. The Abloh story starts in suburban Rockford, Illinois in 1980. His mother Eunice and father Nee, Ghanaian immigrants to America in the 1970s, were respectively a seamstress and a manager of a paint company. As a teenager, Abloh was into skateboarding, soccer and graffiti but, looking back, his greatest inspiration was hip-hop. And he sees obvious parallels with critiques of his design work. \u201cHip-hop\u2019s a music form that\u2019s made by sampling a soul or jazz record and making a completely new genre,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could argue, \u2018Is it music or not?\u2019 But you can say now that it\u2019s the number one [genre] in music.\u201d Abloh is not, by most accepted definitions, actually a millennial himself: most have that category starting with a 1982 birthdate. Certainly his academic career followed a more traditional Generation X path. His parents wanted him to learn a trade, so he studied first civil engineering and then trained as an architect. His heroes were an eclectic crew: Kanye West, Rem Koolhaas, Pharrell Williams and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The story goes that he engineered a meeting with West by finding out where the rapper screen-printed his merchandise in Chicago. Now, he says that they probably would have run into each other anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re from the same city, so it\u2019s a small circle.\u201d Either way, they clicked and, for a decade from the mid-2000s, they worked on projects together (Abloh is sometimes called West\u2019s creative director). When, in 2009, West decided to slum it as an intern at the fashion house Fendi in Rome for six months \u2013 with a salary of \u00a3400 a month \u2013 Abloh tagged along. Not many make the jump from intern to artistic director, but Abloh\u2019s ascent tells you what a crazy journey the fashion industry has been on in the past few years. Today, under-35s drive more than 50% of the revenue at some of the top fashion labels and streetwear is mainstream. \u201cFor sure, I bet on it,\u201d he says. \u201cI made a career out of it. When I was showing in fashion week, people were saying, \u2018That\u2019s not fashion.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t referred to as a fashion designer.\u201d Abloh is sometimes described as a dilettante, but he points out that nothing he\u2019s achieved has been easy. \u201cMy career had been 15 years long and there\u2019s only been people paying attention for the last three,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this exact amount of work and type of work for a long time. It\u2019s the life of a designer and artist that not everything works, but when everyone\u2019s watching hopefully it\u2019s working.\u201d In 2019, everyone\u2019s watching, everything\u2019s working. On the day we meet, Abloh has flown into Switzerland from Chicago, where the Museum of Contemporary Art is staging a career-spanning retrospective: he is, to confirm, 38 years old. His latest collections for Off-White and Louis Vuitton were presented at Paris Fashion Week this month (his LV jamboree, which featured floral harnesses, Arsenal\u2019s H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn and a red bouncy castle, was \u201cthe standout show\u201d of the week, said W Magazine). He\u2019s had to finish off this project with Vitra and go back and forth with Ikea. Most of us, it\u2019s safe to say, wouldn\u2019t last five minutes as Virgil Abloh. The reason for this punishing pace is that he loves what he does and perhaps knows that this is his time. \u201cI feel like now is a tremendous time in culture,\u201d he says, at the Vitra launch. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s the Renaissance. I feel like Bernini just sculpting away, defining a moment of enlightenment. I\u2019m just an eager kid who looks at every day as a possibility to make something and leave a good impact.\u201d Abloh\u2019s private life is mainly that \u2013 private \u2013 but we know he is married to Shannon Sundberg, whom he met in high school, and they have two young children, Lowe and Grey. It\u2019s been estimated that he\u2019s on the road 320 days a year \u2013 \u201ca myth,\u201d he counters \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t deny he has to be obsessive about his work. \u201cAny person you can cite: Steve Jobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Michael Jordan \u2013 they are not common names because they did it nine-to-five,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people on Earth that dedicate themselves to their practice or whatever. I\u2019ve always been like that.\u201d In his staff, Abloh looks for and expects a similar work ethic. At Vitra, he notes that he makes most of his hires straight from social media. \u201cIf you have an awesome Instagram, I\u2019ll follow you, DM you and say, \u2018Hey, do you want a job?\u2019 And if you are self-motivated, you\u2019re going to get promoted in two seconds because that\u2019s ultimately the shot I wanted when I was a kid.\u201d Working at this speed also means that Abloh doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about how people (especially trolls) are responding to what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s adamant that his gaze is set 30 years down the line, not at the comments on an Instagram post. As he puts it: \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for someone else to tell me what grade I get on it.\u201d And how does he feel about his work reselling for inflated multiples of their original price? Another shrug. \u201cLike on my list of things to worry about\u2026 I can\u2019t control it,\u201d Abloh replies. \u201cI\u2019m just the creator of the idea, the company is more in control.\u201d On the evidence of his Vitra project \u2013 whether Abloh is interested or not \u2013 he appears to have another hit. The range sold out in days, and it does seem to have initiated a conversation about design among a new crowd. At the end of a public talk he gave at the Vitra Campus, the stage was mobbed by teens and 20-somethings, many of whom were standing in their socks, thrusting up sneakers for Abloh to sign. \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star!\u201d says a design writer that I\u2019m sitting next to. It\u2019s definitely hard to think of another contemporary designer who would inspire such a response \u2013 even harder to name one who would later play a 90-minute DJ set, until 12.30am, at the Vitra summer party (unexpected highlight: Journey\u2019s Don\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019.) Of course, Abloh\u2019s designs will likely never be for everyone \u2013 perhaps inevitably for someone who confronts, and affronts, the status quo so directly. At Basel airport the next day, I try to put one of his cinder blocks through the X-ray machine. The security officer looks bemused and pulls me aside for clarification. \u201cFran\u00e7ais, Deutsch, English?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I explain to him that it\u2019s a ceramic design object. He takes a knife, slices the tape on the cardboard packaging. I\u2019m travelling with a PR and he opens Abloh\u2019s Instagram page, showing the brick in situ. The image already has 40,000 likes. The security man\u2019s expression is unchanged: he picks up the brick, spins it around in his hand, puts it back and waves me through without comment. There will be another drop of Virgil Abloh c/o Vitra this autumn. Visit vitra.com for more information",

Sherman is the gawky boy, the Manhattan dowager, the foolish clown and the silver screen goddess; she is the mall chick, the soccer mum and the corpse. In the most recent sequence here, she appears four times over in the same lifesize image of a blonde kidult got up in athleisure, expensive extensions ironed flat. She looks 40, pretending to be 20. Sherman herself is now 65.</p> <p>The more you see of her shape-shifting illusions, the more astonishing they seem. How can she be the Texan cowgirl with her wide smile and wizened tan, as well as the elderly gumshoe in mackintosh and trilby.

But still this does not account either for the sheer variety of her transformations, or the feat of her vanishing acts.</p> <p>As a student in the 70s, Sherman disappeared into the full range of figures from Cluedo, cook to colonel to scarlet woman. The greasepaint was pantomime coarse, but wholly convincing. It was almost impossible to know that each part was played by the same woman \u2013 except for the shutter release cable, clearly visible, for the taking of self-portraits.</p> <p>In the 80s, according to the show\u2019s curator, Sherman turned to the grotesque in reaction to the fame of her <em>Film Stills</em>. Possibly the most sinister image in her <em>Fairy Tales</em> sequence shows an androgynous figure in a nightgown, lost in the dark woods, moonlight catching his/her alarmingly vacant face. In another, the human presence, such as it is, has morphed into a sweating pig\u2019s head.</p> <p>And still the collectors snapped up these nightmares for their walls. Sherman has always had to dodge her own success. Her old master portraits \u2013 vast as the great paintings in the galleries upstairs \u2013 have menacing overtones. Here\u2019s a (nearly) Raphael, Rubens and Ingres, except that the brushstrokes are parodied in extravagant and even violent cosmetics. A Renaissance century Madonna bears a breast that is startlingly crude: prosthetics used to challenge aesthetics.</p> <p>The genres multiply. The style of women\u2019s magazine covers is sent up with sardonic wit \u2013 housewife to porn star, and back, in rapid sequence; fashion photography is shrewdly pastiched, with Sherman in heroine chic poses, white as a sheet with blood-rimmed eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4303b01806582b7028a2126a095ff586e445313\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4303b01806582b7028a2126a095ff586e445313/0_0_2620_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled #577 by Cindy Sherman, 2016/18.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"916\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled #577 by Cindy Sherman, 2016/18.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Metro Pictures, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That this is all achieved with makeup is made more or less conspicuous. In the recent photographs of ageing film stars \u2013 almost Anjelica Huston, almost Bette Davis \u2013 the special effects are laid out in full view. Different mouths painted on her own heavily concealed lips; eyebrows erased and replaced with seductive crescents or abrupt hyphens; eye shadows, eyeliners and contact lenses overriding the true colour of her eyes.</p> <p>This show is a masterclass in makeup, quite apart from anything else. You can see some of her methods in an early reverse striptease, as it were, in which Sherman turns herself from spectacled geek all the way through to glamour model \u2013 with a single clear Cindy, perhaps, among the sequential stages. And staging is, of course, the point. For although all these different people seem to have the full force of real beings out there in the world, it is also crucial that we must know that they are neither real, nor quite actresses playing the part, but a single artist inventing an immense succession of selves.</p> <p>Sherman has by now invented more than 600 personae; every one of them is a recognisable type, to some extent, and yet also an individual. The gap between the two is the most fascinating aspect of her art; particularly conveyed in the portraits of women who are not young any more. The hostess who thinks she looks a bit like Hillary Clinton and has taken Annie Leibovitz\u2019s <em>Vogue</em> cover shoots to a makeover artist who hasn\u2019t quite pulled it off. The Fifth Avenue socialite whose facelift has slipped. The Republican matron still trying to look like a college sweetheart.</p> <p>Foundation leaves a tidemark, concealer reveals itself in the studio flashlight. These women are still trying to keep up appearances, but the cracks are beginning to show. And looking hard at these enormous shots, substitutes for the old family portrait above the fireplace, you notice another abiding characteristic of Sherman\u2019s art. No matter that they are photographs, her images never have the momentary status of snapshots. They seem to stand outside time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"102deca4b86a7fd3d8ed618b2a9d579119c8f4a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/102deca4b86a7fd3d8ed618b2a9d579119c8f4a9/0_0_5600_4881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled #602, 2019 by Cindy Sherman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"872\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An eerie feedback loop of herself\u2019: Untitled #602, 2019 by Cindy Sherman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cindy Sherman/Courtesy of the artist and Metro Pictures, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The very latest work is effectively a double portrait. It shows a pale and slightly reptilian man, expensively dressed and standing in an elaborately landscaped garden. He might belong to the art world, perhaps a curator or collector. Certainly he is wearing an early Cindy Sherman T-shirt, from the <em>Rear </em><em>Screen Projections</em>, in which she plays the part of a Hitchcock actress.</p> <p>The artist appears in an eerie feedback loop of herself, young and old, male and female, posing, appearing, trying herself on, forthcoming yet withheld. Between the two faces there are so many nuances, of doubt, anxiety, innocence, reticence, candour. Who is Cindy, what is she? It is almost impossible to fix upon her in this slippery image. As in life, so in art: Sherman makes herself up as she goes along; and her camera catches the truth, that we may all be strangers to ourselves.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/cindy-sherman/exhibition/\">Cindy Sherman</a> is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, until 15 September</p></li> </ul>",

In the 80s, according to the show\u2019s curator, Sherman turned to the grotesque in reaction to the fame of her Film Stills. Possibly the most sinister image in her Fairy Tales sequence shows an androgynous figure in a nightgown, lost in the dark woods, moonlight catching his/her alarmingly vacant face. In another, the human presence, such as it is, has morphed into a sweating pig\u2019s head. And still the collectors snapped up these nightmares for their walls. Sherman has always had to dodge her own success. Her old master portraits \u2013 vast as the great paintings in the galleries upstairs \u2013 have menacing overtones. Here\u2019s a (nearly) Raphael, Rubens and Ingres, except that the brushstrokes are parodied in extravagant and even violent cosmetics. A Renaissance century Madonna bears a breast that is startlingly crude: prosthetics used to challenge aesthetics. The genres multiply. The style of women\u2019s magazine covers is sent up with sardonic wit \u2013 housewife to porn star, and back, in rapid sequence; fashion photography is shrewdly pastiched, with Sherman in heroine chic poses, white as a sheet with blood-rimmed eyes. That this is all achieved with makeup is made more or less conspicuous. In the recent photographs of ageing film stars \u2013 almost Anjelica Huston, almost Bette Davis \u2013 the special effects are laid out in full view. Different mouths painted on her own heavily concealed lips; eyebrows erased and replaced with seductive crescents or abrupt hyphens; eye shadows, eyeliners and contact lenses overriding the true colour of her eyes. This show is a masterclass in makeup, quite apart from anything else. You can see some of her methods in an early reverse striptease, as it were, in which Sherman turns herself from spectacled geek all the way through to glamour model \u2013 with a single clear Cindy, perhaps, among the sequential stages. And staging is, of course, the point. For although all these different people seem to have the full force of real beings out there in the world, it is also crucial that we must know that they are neither real, nor quite actresses playing the part, but a single artist inventing an immense succession of selves. Sherman has by now invented more than 600 personae; every one of them is a recognisable type, to some extent, and yet also an individual. The gap between the two is the most fascinating aspect of her art; particularly conveyed in the portraits of women who are not young any more. The hostess who thinks she looks a bit like Hillary Clinton and has taken Annie Leibovitz\u2019s Vogue cover shoots to a makeover artist who hasn\u2019t quite pulled it off. The Fifth Avenue socialite whose facelift has slipped. The Republican matron still trying to look like a college sweetheart. Foundation leaves a tidemark, concealer reveals itself in the studio flashlight. These women are still trying to keep up appearances, but the cracks are beginning to show. And looking hard at these enormous shots, substitutes for the old family portrait above the fireplace, you notice another abiding characteristic of Sherman\u2019s art. No matter that they are photographs, her images never have the momentary status of snapshots. They seem to stand outside time. The very latest work is effectively a double portrait. It shows a pale and slightly reptilian man, expensively dressed and standing in an elaborately landscaped garden. He might belong to the art world, perhaps a curator or collector. Certainly he is wearing an early Cindy Sherman T-shirt, from the Rear Screen Projections, in which she plays the part of a Hitchcock actress. The artist appears in an eerie feedback loop of herself, young and old, male and female, posing, appearing, trying herself on, forthcoming yet withheld. Between the two faces there are so many nuances, of doubt, anxiety, innocence, reticence, candour. Who is Cindy, what is she? It is almost impossible to fix upon her in this slippery image. As in life, so in art: Sherman makes herself up as she goes along; and her camera catches the truth, that we may all be strangers to ourselves. Cindy Sherman is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, until 15 September",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere are so many things that you get asked to do,\u201d says Jackie Kay of her role as makar, or poet laureate of Scotland, \u201cthat you think, God, wouldn\u2019t it be great to be one of those artists who have 10 or 15 people working for them and they all make this huge big painting? I\u2019d love to have mini-makars. I\u2019d give them this line to do and that commission, because there isn\u2019t really enough of you to do everything you\u2019re asked. It\u2019s just not possible. I\u2019m only the one makar.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily this makar, the third since the position was established by the Scottish parliament in 2004, has found time to meet up in the lobby of a Manchester hotel, prior to an appearance at the city\u2019s literary festival, and compare notes with another eminent national bard. Tracy K Smith is the 22nd poet laureate of the United States and the fourth woman of colour to occupy the role. Her second and final term has just ended \u2013 she will be succeeded by the Native American poet Joy Harjo \u2013 but she has plenty to discuss with Kay about the satisfactions and scarier aspects of the job.</p> <p>Last month, Smith, 47, published <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/eternity-9780141987866.html\" title=\"\">Eternity</a></em>, a selection of work from her four books of poetry to date, beginning with <em>The Body\u2019s Question </em>in 2003 and including the Pulitzer prize-winning <em>Life </em><em>on Mars</em> (2011), which explored sci-fi, astrophysics and the celestial nature of David Bowie. Smith was born in Massachusetts and raised in Fairfield, California, by an engineer father and a schoolteacher mother who both grew up in Alabama during the civil rights era. Reflections on race and slavery surface throughout her work, alongside meditations on desire, loss and the eternal.</p> <p>Kay, 10 years Smith\u2019s senior, is one of the UK\u2019s best-loved poets. Born to a Scottish mother and a Nigerian father in Edinburgh, she was adopted by a white Scottish couple and raised in a suburb of Glasgow. She has written numerous volumes of poetry since <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/adoption-papers.html\" title=\"\">The Adoption Papers</a> </em>in 1991 \u2013 tackling subjects as diverse as sexuality, jazz and Nigel Farage \u2013 as well as a novel, children\u2019s books and a memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/26/red-dust-road-jackie-kay\" title=\"\">Red Dust Road</a></em>, which movingly recounts her search for her biological parents.</p> <p>The two women have never met before, but each has clearly immersed themselves in the other\u2019s writing. \u201cBefore I even came today, I felt like I\u2019d already had a conversation with you, through our work,\u201d says Kay at one point. Both strongly believe in poetry as a means of fostering empathy by inhabiting different characters and different selves. \u201cIn a way I think of your work as a great opera of voices,\u201d Kay tells Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re saying that all of these human beings come through us, that we\u2019re not one person, we\u2019re many.\u201d</p> <p>The two poets need very little prompting to get started and the conversation flows so freely that it\u2019s difficult to get a word in edgeways. Kay speaks in a headlong, ebullient way, taking great pleasure in impersonations as she recalls her travels around Scotland as makar. Smith, currently a professor of creative writing at Princeton, is a touch less animated, weighing her words carefully, but she expresses herself with feeling throughout, not least when talk turns to the necessity of poetry in the age of Trump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d50a755f7ecf97070ba2cf0e5e0f8db3eede57a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d50a755f7ecf97070ba2cf0e5e0f8db3eede57a4/0_111_3500_2469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Makar Jackie Kay with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, at the Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh, 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Makar Jackie Kay with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Let\u2019s start by talking about being a poet laureate \u2013 or makar in Jackie\u2019s case. What\u2019s the experience been like for each of you?</strong></p> <p><strong>JK </strong>It\u2019s a huge honour and a huge surprise to be picked as the national poet, particularly if you had an ambivalent relationship with your country for some of your life. Lots of different things come along with it. I wrote a poem for the opening of the Scottish parliament three years ago and the Queen was there, and the whole of the parliament, and my mum and dad \u2013 my dad, who\u2019d fought as the Communist party candidate for years, said: \u201cI\u2019ve made it at last, I\u2019ve finally got in!\u201d I\u2019ve just written a poem to celebrate 20 years of Scottish devolution that\u2019s multi-voiced, because I see my role \u2013 and I think we have a lot in common in this way \u2013 as not just representing my own voice but the voices you don\u2019t get to hear from. What about you? What was it like when you were asked?</p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>I was honoured and grateful, but also scared because I\u2019d seen so many poets laureate do amazing outreach work and I asked myself, what could I do that they haven\u2019t already done? But then I started thinking about how our national discourse in the US has become so splintered, with such division and intolerance across different perspectives, and I thought, poetry is good medicine for that, it\u2019s something that makes everyone a little bit more attentive.</p> <p>What\u2019s been so exciting to me is going into spaces where there are people who say, \u201cOh I\u2019ve always been bad at poetry\u201d, and I say, \u201cNo, this is our original language. We lived in images and metaphor and associations and dreams until it was taught that we should be thinking otherwise, and what we are doing together now is restoring something that we ought to claim.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Are you reaching audiences that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have reached?</strong></p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>In literal terms, yes. I\u2019ve been going to places where someone from a coastal city, from a university environment, might not ordinarily be invited into. I\u2019ve been to a lot of southern and rural communities, where community is divided along the lines of race, and I\u2019ve spoken to people who are black who say, \u201cI want my daughter here, to see someone who looks like her doing something like this\u201d, and people who are white saying, \u201cI drove two hours to bring my kids here because we live in a community where things are really divided and I want them to know that\u2019s not the way the world should be.\u201d</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>Never underestimate how powerful that is. On a broader scale, I think poetry has the potential to heal some of these divides. If you look at the difficulties in the world at the moment, the answers to some of those difficulties are creative. People are coming in droves to poetry readings all over, because they feel like they need some answers. Poetry provides some of these answers because it\u2019s not a polemic and it speaks to the different losses, divides, uncertainties and fragilities that people carry within them. In these very uncertain times, poetry is community, poetry is soul, it\u2019s the language of being human, it finds a way to reach across.</p> <p><strong>Have your duties as makar taken you to interesting places?</strong></p> <p><strong>JK </strong>It\u2019s been extraordinary going to some really remote parts of Scotland, because you get a real sense of your country changing. I went to an island in the Outer Hebrides, Uist, and at the reading I looked out into the audience and saw a lot of lesbians, and I was amazed \u2013 the Outer Hebrides! I mentioned this to the woman who was driving me around the next day, and without missing a beat she said: \u201cAye, we managed to hang on to our lesbians. We lose our gay men though\u2026\u201d A sentence like that was unthinkable even five years ago in Scotland.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve both written memoirs [Kay published </strong><em><strong>Red Dust Road</strong></em><strong> in 2011, Smith\u2019s </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/03/ordinary-light-tracy-k-smith-review-memoir\" title=\"\">Ordinary Light</a></strong></em><strong> came out in 2015]. How did that compare to writing poetry?</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21cb4824cf9bb1a532e8777387cfc822746dc304\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21cb4824cf9bb1a532e8777387cfc822746dc304/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy K Smith speaks at Harvard University where she received the 2019 Harvard Arts Medal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracy K Smith speaks at Harvard University where she received the 2019 Harvard Arts Medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Marotta/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>TKS </strong>I felt like I was learning to walk again. I really wanted to write about my mother [Kathryn, who died in 1994] and that sense of early loss in prose, rather than poetry, but once I sat down to do that, it was terrifying. It was only through that process that I came to realise my story wasn\u2019t just about the death of a parent, but about growing up black in suburban northern California in the 70s and 80s, where race wasn\u2019t something that we had a vocabulary for discussing outside of my home. And then I became aware of all of the ways I\u2019d avoided hearing my parents\u2019 stories about the hardships they\u2019d endured growing up in the segregated south, because those things hurt me. Writing the book allowed me to acknowledge that, and I think it opened up the space for the poems that I wrote in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/17/wade-in-the-water-tracy-k-smith-review-us-poet-laureate\" title=\"\">Wade in the Water</a></em>.</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>I found writing <em>Red Dust Road</em> frightening, too. And even though <em>The Adoption Papers</em> was autobiographical, it felt very different, because in a poem you can jump, you can hide behind things and go from the general to the universal quite quickly, and you can say, \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t really me.\u201d</p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>\u201cThat was the speaker\u2026\u201d</p> <p><strong>JK</strong> Whereas in a memoir, there is no hiding place, and I found that very difficult for lots of reasons. Ethically, what was my right to write about these people who were still alive? Can I say things they\u2019d be uncomfortable with?</p> <p>The other thing I had to confront was loss. Only when I was writing <em>Red Dust Road</em> did I realise that the loss from having been separated from my original mother was a loss that I carry around with me. It was an uncomfortable thing to confront, but it felt like it would move me on in terms of whatever I tried to write next, and also as a person in my life. Because we run from loss, but actually we\u2019re made of absences and presences, and absences take up just as much space in our life as presences, they\u2019re sat right behind us, they go to bed with us. Absence is a palpable thing. We\u2019re taught to think that it\u2019s not, but anybody who has suffered any kind of grief knows that grief walks alongside you and you can\u2019t really escape it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Poetry takes us to the language of the deep self, and it also reminds us that other people matter</p> <footer> <cite>Tracy K Smith</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>TKS </strong>I was so moved by the passage in <em>Red Dust Road</em> where you are realising that your birth mother\u2019s sense of loss that emerges in Alzheimer\u2019s was always there, and that it was about having a child taken away. That was such a beautiful act of empathy. The conditions of our lives are so different and yet I felt that there\u2019s so many things that they share.</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>I felt that too. I really appreciate the way that you write about loss. My mum and dad are 94 and 88 and I\u2019m living in this stage now of pre-grief. I have a double life: one minute I\u2019m donning the plastic gloves and being a carer and next minute I\u2019m walking out on to stage. It\u2019s kind of doing my head in, but I find reading these poems enormously comforting because you show the different ways in which you keep people with you. That love that you have for them is still in you, and in a sense they\u2019re still here.</p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>I remember reading a Joseph Brodsky essay in college in which he wrote that at the heart of every poem is the desire not to give death the last word, even just in capturing a moment and holding it still until you can mine it. I thought to myself, this will be helpful to me one day, to realise that poems can do this.</p> <p><strong>JK</strong> That\u2019s really amazing.</p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>I have this idea that we are different selves. And there\u2019s something so beautiful about being drawn into that sense of largeness and community.</p> <p><strong>JK</strong> That\u2019s what comes across in so much of your work, the idea of the large self, almost the Whitmanesque self of being large and containing multitudes.</p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>Sometimes I think poetry is a way of defying [the limits of] one\u2019s own intelligence. For me, I don\u2019t understand physics, politics is hard for me, but poems allow me to find a construct by which this can become not only familiar, but intimate. Sometimes I describe my poems as thought experiments. I want to imagine being in the world in a better way: this poem can help me to make the better choice \u2013 to watch, listen, feel, connect, ask \u2013 than I have the wherewithal to make as a person.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel your poems actually make you a better person?</strong></p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>I feel that my poems allow me to go upstairs to that better self, and to live by her courage and insight. And I get to dwell there and impart something, but then I come back downstairs and I\u2019m like: \u201cWhat are your socks doing over there?\u201d [laughs]</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>I don\u2019t feel that my poems allow me to be a better person at all. I think maybe being a poet gives you a different way of listening to the beat of the world, and it lets you see the past and the present as a continuum, but I don\u2019t think it necessarily makes you a better or worse person. It\u2019s to do with your phrase, being awake \u2013 and I like the new use of the word \u201cwoke\u201d. It\u2019s one of those pieces of contemporary language that I actually really enjoy, the idea that, yes, we need to wake up, we need to watch what the world is doing and listen to our young people. We need to care about the world in the way that these young people are caring about the world, and recognise some of our mistakes and see that we\u2019ve got urgent things to deal with, and that we need to let our voices be heard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7cf04cee0a0a73f5a9bb7443fc803c9b636c0874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cf04cee0a0a73f5a9bb7443fc803c9b636c0874/2431_820_5807_3374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy K. Smith and Jackie Key\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Poetry is</strong><strong> increasingly popular, at least </strong><strong>going by sales figures and levels of media interest. Is it because we\u2019re going through difficult times and people are turning to poetry for comfort?</strong></p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>I tend to think that poetry offers a necessary alternative vocabulary. Increasingly we are encouraged or even required to live in this vocabulary driven by the marketplace and technology, and so our terms for love and selfhood and friendship and work have been squeezed into these really flat, monetised words. Young people sometimes write to me and say: \u201cI\u2019m writing a book, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to brand myself and get followers.\u201d Those are not things that you want! Poetry takes us to the language of the deep self, and it also reminds us that other people matter. And it allows people to feel seen and heard, especially people of colour and communities that don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being seen and heard on their terms.</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>There\u2019s been a great democratisation of the world of poetry. In the past, it was seen as only certain kinds of people wrote poems, but now there isn\u2019t that same divide. There\u2019s all sorts of different forms: spoken-word poetry, Instagram poetry\u2026 Poets like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/16/hollie-mcnish-politics-of-poetry-ted-hughes-prize-winner\" title=\"\">Hollie McNish</a> have taken off and are selling lots. But the average poet is not selling lots, that\u2019s a bit of a press distortion; poetry is only selling more for these internet sensations. If you look into the statistics in this country, the average poet sells fewer than 200 books. But it is exciting that these different voices are coming into the world of poetry and making it more varied, more various.</p> <p><strong>There has been some heated debate around Insta-poetry and ideas of accessibility, whether poetry needs be difficult in order to be worthwhile. Where do you stand on that?</strong></p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>There are people who like to be gatekeepers, and that is an explanation for why poetry was made so difficult, unnecessarily, by certain modes of teaching. It means you\u2019ve climbed up and done the scholarship to be able to own something, so how can other people just walk up easily and own this thing?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Poetry doesn\u2019t belong to some wee white man \u2013 it\u2019s bigger than that. It belongs to all\u00a0time</p> <footer> <cite>Jackie Kay</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>JK </strong>Exactly, and I really don\u2019t like it when somebody says poetry should be difficult and inaccessible, that you have to understand every classic form of poetry before you can write it. I agree with you that there are gatekeepers who want to keep people shut out. Those same people will say that fewer people should write poetry, not more, and they are actually writing articles saying that \u2013 there\u2019s been quite a few, not really naming names, but I would if I had a glass of wine\u2026</p> <p><strong>We met too early in the day\u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>JK </strong>We did. But I find it really offensive actually. How dare you think that you can lock poetry up and call it yours? Poetry is bigger than that. Poetry doesn\u2019t belong to some wee white man. It belongs to all of time and it will go on ahead of you and behind you and it\u2019s not going to be kept. Poetry shouldn\u2019t be a zoo animal locked up in a cage, poetry should be out in the wild, whereas some people want to keep it locked up and feed it odd bits of meat and let it roar in their face.</p> <p><strong>Did either of you come across gatekeepers when you were starting out as poets?</strong></p> <p><strong>JK </strong>Lots. If you\u2019re a black writer in any form, there\u2019s this attitude that you have to first of all prove you\u2019re any good. Every single black writer knows what that feels like. And it\u2019s really shocking. When Toni Morrison got given the Nobel prize, she said: \u201cI hope I\u2019m being given this for the right reasons.\u201d That really upset me. I thought, how sad that a writer of such phenomenal talent as Toni Morrison has to worry whether or not they\u2019ve given it to her because she\u2019s black. A white writer never has that worry. And when a black writer does get a prize, other writers, white writers, will say: \u201cOh, it\u2019s so hard for white writers these days.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/21/bantam-jackie-kay-review-home-truths-from-goddess-small-things\">Bantam by Jackie Kay review \u2013 home truths from a goddess of small things</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>TKS </strong>Oh God\u2026</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>And it\u2019s the same with women writers. There is still a terrible prejudice out there against black writers, and people don\u2019t even check themselves. They\u2019ll read a black writer to see, is this any good? That\u2019s the first question they\u2019ll be asking. And the first answer in their head will be: \u201cThey can\u2019t really write.\u201d Any black writer has to get past that first and it\u2019s terribly depressing. People do it unconsciously, they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re doing it. The poetry world is full of people that do that. As soon as any new voices come into the poetry world, you\u2019ll have a number of white writers who\u2019ll say: \u201cWell, I like them, they\u2019re a nice person, but they\u2019re not really any good.\u201d And they won\u2019t know that they\u2019re just doing that by default.</p> <p><strong>That hasn\u2019t changed since you were starting out?</strong></p> <p><strong>JK </strong>No it hasn\u2019t. What\u2019s changed is people of colour getting more recognition, more prizes and more attention. But the default position in several parts of the literary white establishment is, \u201cYes, but they\u2019re not really any good\u201d, and that will take years and years to correct.</p> <p><strong>Is there the same problem in the US?</strong></p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>It\u2019s definitely similar. One thing I will say is that American poetry has been revived and re-energised by the voices of writers of colour and immigrant communities, and publishing has visibly changed over the past two decades as a result of institutions such as <a href=\"https://cavecanempoets.org/\" title=\"\">Cave Canem</a>, which began by hosting a summer retreat for black writers and sponsoring a first book contest, and has become a model for lots of other literary organisations. It\u2019s now patently clear that the best writing that\u2019s coming out of the States is from these places. There\u2019s been a great flourishing, and we see that the American language and the story of America is many, many different things. That makes me very happy.</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>Take an American writer like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\" title=\"\">Audre Lorde</a>, who died in 1992, but is now experiencing a renaissance both here and in the States. She was a woman way ahead of her time. When she published <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/black-unicorn.html\" title=\"\">The Black Unicorn</a></em> in 1981, it got some critical attention, but she was never really taken seriously. And now she\u2019s being taken seriously, all of these years after her death. There have been so many writers from the States and Britain who were pioneering but didn\u2019t get the kind of sales or attention when they were alive.</p> <p>Does living under Trump change your dynamic in being a poet in the world, Tracy?

Poetry comes out of the political world. You can choose to write any kind of poetry in response, it doesn\u2019t need to be polemical. But a poet who says that they\u2019re divorced from the politics of the world is deluded because, to speak plainly, we all live in the political world, we\u2019re all part of it, and why should poets be separate? My son used to ask me when he was wee: \u201cMummy, why are you always going to poetry?\u201d He thought poetry was a place. And for me, poetry <em>is</em> a place in the world, it\u2019s not like a space in your head. It\u2019s a place in the world, a place at the table, it\u2019s a physical thing.</p> <p><strong>Can I bring the conversation back to where we started? As officially appointed national poets, have you ever felt uncomfortable or politically compromised by your position?</strong></p> <p><strong>TKS </strong>Well, the laureateship is a position that sits within the Library of Congress, it\u2019s not part of the executive branch of government. My position is supposed to sit at a remove from political discourse. In fact, as laureate I was discouraged from talking about policy. But poetry talks about the ways that everything touches us. And so it was really beautiful to say: \u201cOK, here\u2019s a poem, this speaker is talking about being a stranger in a place where no one recognises her. Let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d And inevitably someone will say: \u201cWell, this reminds me of when people immigrate to this country.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about that, but in human terms, as opposed to policy terms. There\u2019s very little that poetry doesn\u2019t reach, I would say there\u2019s nothing that poetry can\u2019t reach.</p> <p><strong>JK </strong>Yes, I agree completely with that, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s made me feel uncomfortable, except that you have to step up a bit into a public role. Suddenly people recognise you in a different way from before, and you\u2019re not going incognito quite as much. And that comes with its own little responsibilities, but some of that is really lovely. Last Christmas, I went to throw change to a guy who was busking and he stopped singing and said: \u201cIt\u2019s the makar \u2013 Merry Christmas, makar!\u201d And the other day I was in a Marks &amp; Spencer in Glasgow and this woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s the makar \u2013 five-pound-off voucher for you, makar!\u201d</p> <p>Things like that are very beautiful but they do make you see that you\u2019ve got higher visibility, and therefore higher responsibility and a larger public voice. And you have to use that carefully because you can\u2019t suddenly be pronouncing on things irresponsibly. I take all those things quite seriously. And nobody gives you any lessons. You don\u2019t get any classes or workshops on how to be a national poet.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Bantam </em>is Jackie Kay\u2019s most recent collection (Picador (\u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "\u201cThere are so many things that you get asked to do,\u201d says Jackie Kay of her role as makar, or poet laureate of Scotland, \u201cthat you think, God, wouldn\u2019t it be great to be one of those artists who have 10 or 15 people working for them and they all make this huge big painting? I\u2019d love to have mini-makars. I\u2019d give them this line to do and that commission, because there isn\u2019t really enough of you to do everything you\u2019re asked. It\u2019s just not possible. I\u2019m only the one makar.\u201d Luckily this makar, the third since the position was established by the Scottish parliament in 2004, has found time to meet up in the lobby of a Manchester hotel, prior to an appearance at the city\u2019s literary festival, and compare notes with another eminent national bard. Tracy K Smith is the 22nd poet laureate of the United States and the fourth woman of colour to occupy the role. Her second and final term has just ended \u2013 she will be succeeded by the Native American poet Joy Harjo \u2013 but she has plenty to discuss with Kay about the satisfactions and scarier aspects of the job. Last month, Smith, 47, published Eternity, a selection of work from her four books of poetry to date, beginning with The Body\u2019s Question in 2003 and including the Pulitzer prize-winning Life on Mars (2011), which explored sci-fi, astrophysics and the celestial nature of David Bowie. Smith was born in Massachusetts and raised in Fairfield, California, by an engineer father and a schoolteacher mother who both grew up in Alabama during the civil rights era. Reflections on race and slavery surface throughout her work, alongside meditations on desire, loss and the eternal. Kay, 10 years Smith\u2019s senior, is one of the UK\u2019s best-loved poets. Born to a Scottish mother and a Nigerian father in Edinburgh, she was adopted by a white Scottish couple and raised in a suburb of Glasgow. She has written numerous volumes of poetry since The Adoption Papers in 1991 \u2013 tackling subjects as diverse as sexuality, jazz and Nigel Farage \u2013 as well as a novel, children\u2019s books and a memoir, Red Dust Road, which movingly recounts her search for her biological parents. The two women have never met before, but each has clearly immersed themselves in the other\u2019s writing. \u201cBefore I even came today, I felt like I\u2019d already had a conversation with you, through our work,\u201d says Kay at one point. Both strongly believe in poetry as a means of fostering empathy by inhabiting different characters and different selves. \u201cIn a way I think of your work as a great opera of voices,\u201d Kay tells Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re saying that all of these human beings come through us, that we\u2019re not one person, we\u2019re many.\u201d The two poets need very little prompting to get started and the conversation flows so freely that it\u2019s difficult to get a word in edgeways. Kay speaks in a headlong, ebullient way, taking great pleasure in impersonations as she recalls her travels around Scotland as makar. Smith, currently a professor of creative writing at Princeton, is a touch less animated, weighing her words carefully, but she expresses herself with feeling throughout, not least when talk turns to the necessity of poetry in the age of Trump. Let\u2019s start by talking about being a poet laureate \u2013 or makar in Jackie\u2019s case. What\u2019s the experience been like for each of you? JK It\u2019s a huge honour and a huge surprise to be picked as the national poet, particularly if you had an ambivalent relationship with your country for some of your life. Lots of different things come along with it. I wrote a poem for the opening of the Scottish parliament three years ago and the Queen was there, and the whole of the parliament, and my mum and dad \u2013 my dad, who\u2019d fought as the Communist party candidate for years, said: \u201cI\u2019ve made it at last, I\u2019ve finally got in!\u201d I\u2019ve just written a poem to celebrate 20 years of Scottish devolution that\u2019s multi-voiced, because I see my role \u2013 and I think we have a lot in common in this way \u2013 as not just representing my own voice but the voices you don\u2019t get to hear from. What about you? What was it like when you were asked? TKS I was honoured and grateful, but also scared because I\u2019d seen so many poets laureate do amazing outreach work and I asked myself, what could I do that they haven\u2019t already done? But then I started thinking about how our national discourse in the US has become so splintered, with such division and intolerance across different perspectives, and I thought, poetry is good medicine for that, it\u2019s something that makes everyone a little bit more attentive. What\u2019s been so exciting to me is going into spaces where there are people who say, \u201cOh I\u2019ve always been bad at poetry\u201d, and I say, \u201cNo, this is our original language. We lived in images and metaphor and associations and dreams until it was taught that we should be thinking otherwise, and what we are doing together now is restoring something that we ought to claim.\u201d Are you reaching audiences that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have reached? TKS In literal terms, yes. I\u2019ve been going to places where someone from a coastal city, from a university environment, might not ordinarily be invited into. I\u2019ve been to a lot of southern and rural communities, where community is divided along the lines of race, and I\u2019ve spoken to people who are black who say, \u201cI want my daughter here, to see someone who looks like her doing something like this\u201d, and people who are white saying, \u201cI drove two hours to bring my kids here because we live in a community where things are really divided and I want them to know that\u2019s not the way the world should be.\u201d JK Never underestimate how powerful that is. On a broader scale, I think poetry has the potential to heal some of these divides. If you look at the difficulties in the world at the moment, the answers to some of those difficulties are creative. People are coming in droves to poetry readings all over, because they feel like they need some answers. Poetry provides some of these answers because it\u2019s not a polemic and it speaks to the different losses, divides, uncertainties and fragilities that people carry within them. In these very uncertain times, poetry is community, poetry is soul, it\u2019s the language of being human, it finds a way to reach across. Have your duties as makar taken you to interesting places? JK It\u2019s been extraordinary going to some really remote parts of Scotland, because you get a real sense of your country changing. I went to an island in the Outer Hebrides, Uist, and at the reading I looked out into the audience and saw a lot of lesbians, and I was amazed \u2013 the Outer Hebrides! I mentioned this to the woman who was driving me around the next day, and without missing a beat she said: \u201cAye, we managed to hang on to our lesbians. We lose our gay men though\u2026\u201d A sentence like that was unthinkable even five years ago in Scotland. You\u2019ve both written memoirs [Kay published Red Dust Road in 2011, Smith\u2019s Ordinary Light came out in 2015]. How did that compare to writing poetry? TKS I felt like I was learning to walk again. I really wanted to write about my mother [Kathryn, who died in 1994] and that sense of early loss in prose, rather than poetry, but once I sat down to do that, it was terrifying. It was only through that process that I came to realise my story wasn\u2019t just about the death of a parent, but about growing up black in suburban northern California in the 70s and 80s, where race wasn\u2019t something that we had a vocabulary for discussing outside of my home. And then I became aware of all of the ways I\u2019d avoided hearing my parents\u2019 stories about the hardships they\u2019d endured growing up in the segregated south, because those things hurt me. Writing the book allowed me to acknowledge that, and I think it opened up the space for the poems that I wrote in Wade in the Water. JK I found writing Red Dust Road frightening, too. And even though The Adoption Papers was autobiographical, it felt very different, because in a poem you can jump, you can hide behind things and go from the general to the universal quite quickly, and you can say, \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t really me.\u201d TKS \u201cThat was the speaker\u2026\u201d JK Whereas in a memoir, there is no hiding place, and I found that very difficult for lots of reasons. Ethically, what was my right to write about these people who were still alive? Can I say things they\u2019d be uncomfortable with? The other thing I had to confront was loss. Only when I was writing Red Dust Road did I realise that the loss from having been separated from my original mother was a loss that I carry around with me. It was an uncomfortable thing to confront, but it felt like it would move me on in terms of whatever I tried to write next, and also as a person in my life. Because we run from loss, but actually we\u2019re made of absences and presences, and absences take up just as much space in our life as presences, they\u2019re sat right behind us, they go to bed with us. Absence is a palpable thing. We\u2019re taught to think that it\u2019s not, but anybody who has suffered any kind of grief knows that grief walks alongside you and you can\u2019t really escape it. TKS I was so moved by the passage in Red Dust Road where you are realising that your birth mother\u2019s sense of loss that emerges in Alzheimer\u2019s was always there, and that it was about having a child taken away. That was such a beautiful act of empathy. The conditions of our lives are so different and yet I felt that there\u2019s so many things that they share. JK I felt that too. I really appreciate the way that you write about loss. My mum and dad are 94 and 88 and I\u2019m living in this stage now of pre-grief. I have a double life: one minute I\u2019m donning the plastic gloves and being a carer and next minute I\u2019m walking out on to stage. It\u2019s kind of doing my head in, but I find reading these poems enormously comforting because you show the different ways in which you keep people with you. That love that you have for them is still in you, and in a sense they\u2019re still here. TKS I remember reading a Joseph Brodsky essay in college in which he wrote that at the heart of every poem is the desire not to give death the last word, even just in capturing a moment and holding it still until you can mine it. I thought to myself, this will be helpful to me one day, to realise that poems can do this. JK That\u2019s really amazing. TKS I have this idea that we are different selves. And there\u2019s something so beautiful about being drawn into that sense of largeness and community. JK That\u2019s what comes across in so much of your work, the idea of the large self, almost the Whitmanesque self of being large and containing multitudes. TKS Sometimes I think poetry is a way of defying [the limits of] one\u2019s own intelligence. For me, I don\u2019t understand physics, politics is hard for me, but poems allow me to find a construct by which this can become not only familiar, but intimate. Sometimes I describe my poems as thought experiments. I want to imagine being in the world in a better way: this poem can help me to make the better choice \u2013 to watch, listen, feel, connect, ask \u2013 than I have the wherewithal to make as a person. Do you feel your poems actually make you a better person? TKS I feel that my poems allow me to go upstairs to that better self, and to live by her courage and insight. And I get to dwell there and impart something, but then I come back downstairs and I\u2019m like: \u201cWhat are your socks doing over there?\u201d [laughs] JK I don\u2019t feel that my poems allow me to be a better person at all. I think maybe being a poet gives you a different way of listening to the beat of the world, and it lets you see the past and the present as a continuum, but I don\u2019t think it necessarily makes you a better or worse person. It\u2019s to do with your phrase, being awake \u2013 and I like the new use of the word \u201cwoke\u201d. It\u2019s one of those pieces of contemporary language that I actually really enjoy, the idea that, yes, we need to wake up, we need to watch what the world is doing and listen to our young people. We need to care about the world in the way that these young people are caring about the world, and recognise some of our mistakes and see that we\u2019ve got urgent things to deal with, and that we need to let our voices be heard. Poetry is increasingly popular, at least going by sales figures and levels of media interest. Is it because we\u2019re going through difficult times and people are turning to poetry for comfort? TKS I tend to think that poetry offers a necessary alternative vocabulary. Increasingly we are encouraged or even required to live in this vocabulary driven by the marketplace and technology, and so our terms for love and selfhood and friendship and work have been squeezed into these really flat, monetised words. Young people sometimes write to me and say: \u201cI\u2019m writing a book, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to brand myself and get followers.\u201d Those are not things that you want! Poetry takes us to the language of the deep self, and it also reminds us that other people matter. And it allows people to feel seen and heard, especially people of colour and communities that don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being seen and heard on their terms. JK There\u2019s been a great democratisation of the world of poetry. In the past, it was seen as only certain kinds of people wrote poems, but now there isn\u2019t that same divide. There\u2019s all sorts of different forms: spoken-word poetry, Instagram poetry\u2026 Poets like Hollie McNish have taken off and are selling lots. But the average poet is not selling lots, that\u2019s a bit of a press distortion; poetry is only selling more for these internet sensations. If you look into the statistics in this country, the average poet sells fewer than 200 books. But it is exciting that these different voices are coming into the world of poetry and making it more varied, more various. There has been some heated debate around Insta-poetry and ideas of accessibility, whether poetry needs be difficult in order to be worthwhile. Where do you stand on that? TKS There are people who like to be gatekeepers, and that is an explanation for why poetry was made so difficult, unnecessarily, by certain modes of teaching. It means you\u2019ve climbed up and done the scholarship to be able to own something, so how can other people just walk up easily and own this thing? JK Exactly, and I really don\u2019t like it when somebody says poetry should be difficult and inaccessible, that you have to understand every classic form of poetry before you can write it. I agree with you that there are gatekeepers who want to keep people shut out. Those same people will say that fewer people should write poetry, not more, and they are actually writing articles saying that \u2013 there\u2019s been quite a few, not really naming names, but I would if I had a glass of wine\u2026 We met too early in the day\u2026 JK We did. But I find it really offensive actually. How dare you think that you can lock poetry up and call it yours? Poetry is bigger than that. Poetry doesn\u2019t belong to some wee white man. It belongs to all of time and it will go on ahead of you and behind you and it\u2019s not going to be kept. Poetry shouldn\u2019t be a zoo animal locked up in a cage, poetry should be out in the wild, whereas some people want to keep it locked up and feed it odd bits of meat and let it roar in their face. Did either of you come across gatekeepers when you were starting out as poets? JK Lots. If you\u2019re a black writer in any form, there\u2019s this attitude that you have to first of all prove you\u2019re any good. Every single black writer knows what that feels like. And it\u2019s really shocking. When Toni Morrison got given the Nobel prize, she said: \u201cI hope I\u2019m being given this for the right reasons.\u201d That really upset me. I thought, how sad that a writer of such phenomenal talent as Toni Morrison has to worry whether or not they\u2019ve given it to her because she\u2019s black. A white writer never has that worry. And when a black writer does get a prize, other writers, white writers, will say: \u201cOh, it\u2019s so hard for white writers these days.\u201d TKS Oh God\u2026 JK And it\u2019s the same with women writers. There is still a terrible prejudice out there against black writers, and people don\u2019t even check themselves. They\u2019ll read a black writer to see, is this any good? That\u2019s the first question they\u2019ll be asking. And the first answer in their head will be: \u201cThey can\u2019t really write.\u201d Any black writer has to get past that first and it\u2019s terribly depressing. People do it unconsciously, they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re doing it. The poetry world is full of people that do that. As soon as any new voices come into the poetry world, you\u2019ll have a number of white writers who\u2019ll say: \u201cWell, I like them, they\u2019re a nice person, but they\u2019re not really any good.\u201d And they won\u2019t know that they\u2019re just doing that by default. That hasn\u2019t changed since you were starting out? JK No it hasn\u2019t. What\u2019s changed is people of colour getting more recognition, more prizes and more attention. But the default position in several parts of the literary white establishment is, \u201cYes, but they\u2019re not really any good\u201d, and that will take years and years to correct. Is there the same problem in the US? TKS It\u2019s definitely similar. One thing I will say is that American poetry has been revived and re-energised by the voices of writers of colour and immigrant communities, and publishing has visibly changed over the past two decades as a result of institutions such as Cave Canem, which began by hosting a summer retreat for black writers and sponsoring a first book contest, and has become a model for lots of other literary organisations. It\u2019s now patently clear that the best writing that\u2019s coming out of the States is from these places. There\u2019s been a great flourishing, and we see that the American language and the story of America is many, many different things. That makes me very happy. JK Take an American writer like Audre Lorde, who died in 1992, but is now experiencing a renaissance both here and in the States. She was a woman way ahead of her time. When she published The Black Unicorn in 1981, it got some critical attention, but she was never really taken seriously. And now she\u2019s being taken seriously, all of these years after her death. There have been so many writers from the States and Britain who were pioneering but didn\u2019t get the kind of sales or attention when they were alive. Does living under Trump change your dynamic in being a poet in the world, Tracy? How does Trump affect you personally? TKS It\u2019s changed the world I live in, and it\u2019s changed the questions and preoccupations I live with. As much as I want to feel that [Trump] isn\u2019t a governing presence for me as a writer, I\u2019m thinking about the fear, the hatred, the distance from clarity and reality that we live with now\u2026 I think this is a really good time for poetry. If anybody ever thought poetry was a luxury, that\u2019s gone. Poetry is a necessary remedy to a lot of the darkness we are subject to. JK Audre Lorde wrote this famous essay called Poetry Is Not a Luxury, and it\u2019s lovely that that phrase has come back\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s strange because Trump has rejigged the notions of reality, and in a way poetry and writers need to get more real because there are different demands being placed on the writer in these times. Do you feel it\u2019s complacent, as a poet, to avoid looking at the world around you and what\u2019s going on in politics? JK You can\u2019t escape the world around you. Poetry comes out of the political world. You can choose to write any kind of poetry in response, it doesn\u2019t need to be polemical. But a poet who says that they\u2019re divorced from the politics of the world is deluded because, to speak plainly, we all live in the political world, we\u2019re all part of it, and why should poets be separate? My son used to ask me when he was wee: \u201cMummy, why are you always going to poetry?\u201d He thought poetry was a place. And for me, poetry is a place in the world, it\u2019s not like a space in your head. It\u2019s a place in the world, a place at the table, it\u2019s a physical thing. Can I bring the conversation back to where we started? As officially appointed national poets, have you ever felt uncomfortable or politically compromised by your position? TKS Well, the laureateship is a position that sits within the Library of Congress, it\u2019s not part of the executive branch of government. My position is supposed to sit at a remove from political discourse. In fact, as laureate I was discouraged from talking about policy. But poetry talks about the ways that everything touches us. And so it was really beautiful to say: \u201cOK, here\u2019s a poem, this speaker is talking about being a stranger in a place where no one recognises her. Let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d And inevitably someone will say: \u201cWell, this reminds me of when people immigrate to this country.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about that, but in human terms, as opposed to policy terms. There\u2019s very little that poetry doesn\u2019t reach, I would say there\u2019s nothing that poetry can\u2019t reach. JK Yes, I agree completely with that, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s made me feel uncomfortable, except that you have to step up a bit into a public role. Suddenly people recognise you in a different way from before, and you\u2019re not going incognito quite as much. And that comes with its own little responsibilities, but some of that is really lovely. Last Christmas, I went to throw change to a guy who was busking and he stopped singing and said: \u201cIt\u2019s the makar \u2013 Merry Christmas, makar!\u201d And the other day I was in a Marks &amp; Spencer in Glasgow and this woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s the makar \u2013 five-pound-off voucher for you, makar!\u201d Things like that are very beautiful but they do make you see that you\u2019ve got higher visibility, and therefore higher responsibility and a larger public voice.

      "bodyText": "The number of people who believe that in order to be English you have to be white has halved over the past seven years, with the older generation apparently driving a wider acceptance of people with different ethnic backgrounds. Just over 10% of people believe that ethnicity is an important determining factor in being English, compared to 20% from a 2012 study, according to British Future and the Centre for English Identity and Politics, which is about to publish its follow-up to the 2012 study, This Sceptred Isle. The biggest change was noted among over-65s, where the importance of whiteness fell from 35% to 16%. The new data could challenge the perception that the 2016 Brexit referendum reflected an increase in xenophobic English identity. The findings suggest that during the time of the Brexit vote, perceptions of English identity were becoming more, rather than less, ethnically inclusive. A contributing factor to this shift in perceptions is likely to be emergence of examples of English diversity. Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia was a prominent example. Southgate described the England squad as a team that represented \u201cmodern England\u201d. In an ITV interview, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a bit of time being lost as to what our modern identity is, and I think as a team we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.\u201d This was echoed by Sunder Katwala, director of British Future. \u201cAn inclusive England may be symbolised by Raheem Sterling and Nikita Parris scoring goals for England, or Moeen Ali taking wickets in the World Cup, but it also reflects the lived reality of who most of us now think of as English.\u201d Other signifiers of English identity saw a smaller change. Previous results showed 56% of participants thought it was important for your parents to have been born in England, and the latest show 48% do \u2013 marking a drop of 8%. \u201cThere has been an important generational shift in how we think about England and the English,\u201d said Katwala. \u201cThere has been no doubt that most people who have migrated to England, like my parents, usually felt they were invited to become British but not often to identify as English, too. An increasing number of their children, born in England, have felt they can choose to identify as English as well as British.\u201d However, the survey showed that three factors \u2013 being born in England, paying taxes in England and contributing to English society \u2013 were seen as important in being English by more than 70% of the population. Similar polling carried out by YouGov in 2018 revealed that members of BAME communities are still significantly less likely to consider themselves English. However, the perception that being English is strongly related to being born in England could allow new generations of BAME citizens to be more readily acknowledged as English. John Denham, director of the Centre for English Identity and Politics, said: \u201cThe idea that English is an ethnic identity is widely repeated in the media and politics. That Englishness has become even more inclusive at a time in which our society has become more divided is to be welcomed. \u201cEthnicity is clearly much less important outside a small hardcore of residents. The further development of an inclusive Englishness would benefit from positive engagement by leaders across the political spectrum. This should aim to encourage BAME citizens to see English identity as open to them and that the strongest English identifiers continue to support the opening up of English identity.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Householders keen to install solar panels are weighing up their options after the government unveiled new plans for the way people will be paid for supplying renewable energy. The scheme, which will be launched in January next year, works in a different way to its predecessor \u2013 and is likely be less lucrative. With solar photovoltaic (PV) panels \u2013 the most popular domestic option \u2013 costing between \u00a35,000 to \u00a38,000, and six months before the new scheme is up and running, should consumers buy now, wait or skip it?</p> <h2>What is the scheme?</h2> <p>All energy suppliers with at least 150,000 domestic customers (including the big six, such as EDF Energy and Npower, and smaller companies such as Ovo and Bulb) will be required to buy surplus solar, wind or other renewable energy generated by its customers under the smart export guarantee (SEG).</p> <p>The companies will be able to set their own price for this energy. In the past, they paid into a shared pot to buy the renewable energy domestic households sold or \u201cexported\u201d to the grid. The export price paid was fixed by the government.</p> <h2>How did the old system differ?</h2> <p>It was called the feed-in tariff (FiT) and there were two payments \u2013 a \u201cgeneration tariff\u201d and an \u201cexport tariff\u201d. The scheme was launched in April 2010 and closed for new customers at the end of March this year. Those with existing contracts are not affected and continue to be paid.</p> <p>The \u201cgeneration tariff\u201d paid for all the electricity that households generated. Rates were set by the government and depended on when you signed up to the scheme and the size of your solar PV system.</p> <p>Rates were much higher in the early years \u2013 some paid more than 50p per kilowatt hour, but were cut over the years and fell to around 4p for new customers by March this year. Once you had secured a rate it was fixed for the life of your contract, typically 20 or 25 years.</p> <p>The \u201cexport tariff\u201d paid homeowners for the surplus energy they exported to the grid. Rates were fixed by government for the entire contract term and were around the market rate for electricity. It was 3.82p/kWh until August 2012 and then 5.38p until the FiT scheme ended. For all households under the FiT this rate is paid on 50% of all the energy generated by the solar panels. The actual amount exported to the grid is not measured, so everyone gets this regardless of how much electricity they actually export.</p> <p>By way of example, if a property\u2019s solar panels generate 2,000kWh of electricity in a year and the owner has a FiT contract paying a fixed rate of 20p/kWh (for the generation tariff), they will be paid \u00a3400 for all the energy generated. Under the export tariff the same household is then paid a fixed rate (5.38p/kWh) on half of the energy generated (1,000kWh) \u2013 \u00a353. The household will also be using much of its own solar energy, a saving potentially worth hundreds of pounds a year.</p> <h2>Is the SEG less generous?</h2> <p>It would seem so. Homeowners will only be paid for the energy they export back to their energy supplier. A smart meter is required to show exactly how much. There is no longer a \u201cgeneration tariff\u201d so it is likely to take much longer (potentially 20 years) before the initial costs are covered by the SEG payments and energy savings. Unlike the FiT, the export price is not set by government and there will be no long-term contracts. Typically, consumers will be able to secure short-term fixed rates or opt for a variable rate which will pay the \u201cmarket rate\u201d for energy at the time it is exported.</p> <h2>Should I still get solar panels?</h2> <p>Energy companies do not have to start making payments under the SEG scheme until January 2020, but one company \u2013 Octopus Energy \u2013 has already launched two tariffs. The first pays a fixed rate of 5.5p/kWh and the other a variable rate.</p> <p>Solar panels installed now will be eligible for the scheme and consumers can sign up to suppliers as and when they offer tariffs, or wait until 2020. One benefit of installing now might be to avoid an increase in tax \u2013 from October this year VAT on solar panels and batteries will rise from 5% to 20%.</p> <p>Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, expects solar installations will slow this year, but says that people invest in them for a number of reasons and often it won\u2019t be about making the money back quickly, instead seeing the environmental impact as the most important thing. \u201cAnyone hoping to make money under the smart export guarantee should think carefully. We don\u2019t know what rates or contract terms will be offered and rates might vary widely between energy companies,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Anthony Kyriakides, head of renewables at the Energy Saving Trust (EST), agrees there is significant uncertainty. \u201cHow will people search for different tariffs and compare offers?\u201d he says. \u201cIt is understandable that many homeowners will hold off until things are clearer.\u201d</p> <h2>Can I store my solar energy?</h2> <p>A great idea \u2013 but it costs a lot more. One downside of solar panels is that you can only use the energy generated immediately \u2013 that is, when you are at home putting lights on and running appliances. With a battery system you can store electricity to use later or sell back to your supplier \u2013 either way making savings. But battery systems cost at least \u00a34,000, so it will mean even longer until you have paid off the initial outlay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cafd63bc44342926ba4542ef5796c57594704b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cafd63bc44342926ba4542ef5796c57594704b5c/0_463_3088_1853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Power and his wife Abi installed solar panels at their home in Whitstable, Kent, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ross Power and his wife Abi installed solar panels at their home in Whitstable, Kent, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sent by him</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018You need to stick with it\u2019</h2> <p>Staying in a property for a long time is key to maximising the benefits of solar panels, according to a couple who have had them for the last four years.</p> <p>Ross Power, 38, and his wife Abi Gilchrist, 41, both professional musicians who run London and Kent Soul Choirs, installed PV panels at their home in Whitstable, Kent, in 2015.

      "bodyText": "Festival goers were preparing to see Kylie Minogue\u2019s much-anticipated performance on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury on Sunday, 14 years after the singer had to cancel a headline performance in 2005 to undergo cancer treatment. The announcement of Kylie\u2019s performance, in the \u201clegends\u201d slot at Glastonbury\u2019s biggest stage, came amid criticism of the festival for its lack of women in major headline slots. Janet Jackson played on the Pyramid stage on Saturday after the singer used photoshop to promote herself in a line-up poster. In March, Jackson tweeted the festival poster to her fans, but with the order of the acts altered to make it appear that she had top billing. The three headline acts on the festival\u2019s Pyramid stage this year are all men \u2013 Stormzy, the Killers and the Cure. Only three of the acts in the 12 headline slots on the festival\u2019s four main stages are female-led. Acts like Janet Jackson, Lauryn Hill, Miley Cyrus and Kylie are in less prominent slots. Since 2007, eight out of 10 headliners at Glastonbury (82%) have been all-male. Beyonc\u00e9 in 2011 and Adele in 2016 have been the only female soloists to headline. After the announcement of the Glastonbury lineup, singer songwriter KT Tunstall said: \u201cI have to say it\u2019s still a bit depressing looking at the lineups of festivals. Because it\u2019s been discussed \u2013 everyone knows it\u2019s an issue. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big, bad white bloke going \u2018no women\u2019. I think it\u2019s a really deep systemic problem at all stages of music.\u201d Organiser Emily Eavis has committed to creating an equal gender balance of performers at the festival, after the Guardian revealed in 2015 that the lineup then was 86% male. \u201cWe are working towards 50/50,\u201d she said last week. \u201cSome years it\u2019s 60/40. It\u2019s a challenge we\u2019ve really taken on, and I\u2019m always totally conscious every day that the gender balance should be right.\u201d Eavis also told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs that she was often the only woman in meetings with music moguls and that some male executives still insisted on speaking to her father, Michael Eavis, who co-created the festival at the family\u2019s Worthy Farm in Somerset. \u201cThe live music world has been so male-dominated,\u201d she said. \u201cI go to meetings with just tables of men.

      "bodyText": "MPs who have mental health problems are left to suffer in silence because of an absence of proper support services and a lack of trust in party whips, a major report to be published in the British Medical Journal will say this week. The study carried out by researchers at the institute of psychiatry, part of King\u2019s College London, is expected to find that MPs often feel they have no one to turn to if they struggle with mental health issues, because parliament lags behind most modern workplaces in the services it offers. The report is the result of the first formal research project into the mental health and wellbeing of MPs. One of those involved was the Conservative MP Dr Dan Poulter, who is also an NHS psychiatrist. Many MPs have spoken publicly about the pressure and anxieties that can arise from serving both constituents and their party on difficult and divisive issues such as Brexit, while being constantly in the public eye. The report is expected to raise a number of issues about MPs\u2019 lack of awareness about the support services that are available to them and that have been introduced over recent years \u2013 and the practical problems they face in a workplace run on often archaic rules and traditions. In particular, it is expected to raise concerns that they do not feel able to discuss their mental health and wellbeing with party whips, whose key role is as enforcers of party discipline. If an MP wants to be absent from a vote because of health or other issues, he or she would have to inform the whips of the reasons. The whip also keeps files on each MP about their loyalty and voting record which are used to judge who is thought suitable for promotion when ministerial or shadow ministerial reshuffles occur. The researchers conducted questionnaires with MPs of all parties and found that many believed that the lack of adequate services often prevented them doing their job as well as they should. The report is likely to raise new concerns about the outdated workings of parliament, following recent scandals over sexual harassment of parliamentary staff, which led to urgent investigations and changes in complaints procedures. Speaking in 2012 in a debate on mental health, several MPs gave emotional accounts of their own experiences. Former Labour minister Kevan Jones told colleagues: \u201cLike a lot of men, you try and deal with it yourself. You don\u2019t talk to people. First of all it creeps up on you very slowly. \u201cI think in politics we are designed to think somehow that if you admit fault or frailty you are going to be looked on in a disparaging way both by the electorate but also by your peers as well. \u201cWe have got to talk about mental health in this house.

      "bodyText": "Extraordinary evidence has emerged that the Metropolitan Police targeted a Chinese dissident in London following concerted pressure from Beijing. Shao Jiang, a Tiananmen Square survivor who fled China and was granted political asylum, was arrested in London in October 2015 during a state visit from President Xi Jinping. Video footage shows Shao holding two A4 sheets of paper, one saying \u201cEnd Autocracy\u201d and the other saying \u201cDemocracy Now\u201d before being aggressively detained by officers. After being taken to a local police station for a breach of the peace the 52-year-old was subsequently arrested for conspiracy to commit a section 5 public order act offence. This is a more serious charge that then enabled officers to search his London home, seizing computers which Shao suspects may have been given to Chinese authorities before they were returned to him. Police watchdog investigators then found evidence that the Met\u2019s treatment of Shao, one of the last protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, was influenced by pressure from Beijing to ensure Xi was not \u201cembarrassed\u201d by protests during his visit. Following Chinese pressure, documents show UK government officials, understood to be from the Home Office, also made \u201cunusual requests\u201d to the police about managing the state visit, an intervention that one officer described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. Investigators from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found proof that demands from Chinese officials, including its security service, may have informed the decision to arrest Shao for conspiracy. \u201cThere is evidence to indicate that these requests, together with their consideration of the ongoing risk to the CSV [Chinese state visit] and to Shao\u2019s safety, thereby influenced the decision to arrest Shao for conspiracy,\u201d stated an IPOC report. Speaking for the first time about the incident Shao, who escaped Hong Kong before its handover to China in 1997, told the Observer: \u201cI expected so much more in a democratic country. We are now confronted with the chilling reality that we live in a country where the suppression of peaceful protests has greatly undermined the fundamental values of its own civil liberty and democracy.\u201d The revelations of political pressure emerged during an IOPC investigation into Shao\u2019s arrest. Last Wednesday the watchdog announced that police officers questioned over the arrest will not face disciplinary action. Yet it has also emerged that the IOPC completed its investigation into the treatment of Shao in June 2018, finding then that Met officers had a case to answer for gross misconduct. The Met responded to the misconduct verdict and, despite no new evidence emerging, the IOPC completely reversed its decision and found no case to answer. Emily-Jade Defriend, a solicitor for the law firm Bindmans who is representing Shao, said: \u201cThis is completely unacceptable conduct by a regulator which holds itself out to be an independent watchdog of the police. If the IOPC is unwilling to stand by its findings after a lengthy investigation, then it simply isn\u2019t fit for purpose.\u201d Shao, a PhD researcher on democracy, condemned the regulator\u2019s U-turn as \u201cmorally wrong and procedurally incorrect\u201d. Although significantly redacted, the IOPC report refers to a letter from a Met silver commander, who coordinates public order strategy, that \u201cincluded a list of the ways the Chinese delegation had tried to apply different types of pressure to both silver and more widely, the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service].\u201d The commander, in daily contact with the Home Office and Foreign Office before the visit, told investigators of \u201cunusual requests from the UK government in respect of managing protest during the CSV and in their experience this was unprecedented\u201d. Two senior officers from gold and silver command, along with the head of the police powers unit within the Home Office, added that planning meetings were \u201cnot without difficulty\u201d and hinted there was evidence to suggest both Beijing and UK government officials were to blame. Defriend said: \u201cIt is impossible not to conclude from the findings of the report that political pressure was a determining factor in the arrest.\u201d Following the decision to arrest Shao for conspiracy, his home was searched and his laptop, USB stick and other computers were seized. Although no definitive proof has emerged that these items were passed to Chinese officials before they were returned, Shao received a warning from Google that a \u201cstate actor\u201d had attempted to access his accounts. Arresting Shao for conspiracy meant he could receive bail conditions, which prevented him protesting within 100 metres of the Chinese president. The arresting officer, a superintendent, did not witness Shao\u2019s breach of the peace arrest and IOPC investigators were unable to ascertain how he obtained the information that led him to believe Shao had committed the conspiracy offence. The officer refused to answer IOPC questions about the case, which was eventually dropped because of no evidence. The revelations follow intriguing details of a bad-tempered meeting at the Foreign Office\u2019s Lancaster House in the hours before Shao\u2019s arrest with Chinese officials over security arrangements for the state visit. The episode prompted police commander Lucy D\u2019Orsi to later reveal the Chinese delegation \u201cwalked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip [state visit] was off\u201d. D\u2019Orsi said: \u201cThe assertion that political manipulation of the command team or, indeed, the broader Metropolitan Police took place is wrong and doesn\u2019t reflect the facts. The policing of the state visit was a matter for the MPS.

More than a third \u2013 36% \u2013 of those interviewed as part of the research admit that they regularly cut corners and compromise professional standards to meet targets. \u201cThe privatisation of probation is unprecedented in terms of its scale and scope and it has proven to be something of an unmitigated disaster for professionals,\u201d write Professor Gill Kirton, of Queen Mary University of London, and Dr C\u00e9cile Guillaume, of Roehampton University, in the journal Work, Employment and Society, published by the British Sociological Association. The pair looked at the effects of the government\u2019s privatisation of about half of the probation service in 2015, in which lower-risk offenders were monitored by 21 private companies and the rest left to public sector organisations. They surveyed almost 1,000 probation officers, and carried out face-to-face research with 100. More than a third said they did not have enough time for their clients. More than half said their targets were unrealistic.

Puffin-nesting season is in full swing.</p> <p>On a calm day, it is possible to spot dolphins and even humpback and minke whales en route to the island. Not this particular morning, though. The sea is rough and sick bags are passed around with a jocular \u201cNo 5p charge today!\u201d Even so, the feeling of anticipation is palpable \u2013 and not just among our motley crew. Approaching the island, the sound of squawking seabirds is reaching fever pitch.

Eastern Scotland is enjoying a tourist boom at the moment, thanks partly to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/28/dundee-locals-guide-new-va-museum-waterfront\">Dundee\u2019s new V&amp;A</a>, and while it manages to escape the coach tours that often clog up the roads on the west coast, there are many other reasons to visit.</p> <p>For fans of the puffin, the Isle of May is one of the best places in the UK to see them. Puffins mate for life and always return to the same nest, where they will raise just one charmingly named puffling a year. How they locate their nest year after year is mind-boggling \u2013 maybe that accounts for the anxious looks on their faces. They find a life partner at the age of five and can live well into their 30s, which means they are more successful at relationships than most human couples. Designated paths lead visitors all over the isle, a sort of mini Jurassic Park alive with rabbits, eider ducks and, on rocky outcrops around every corner, its rainbow beak pointing into the prevailing wind, the inimitable puffin \u2013 a bird unparalleled in its ability to cheer a weary soul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56dd2619f12ae2797a76d208f76d5526a7fd46fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56dd2619f12ae2797a76d208f76d5526a7fd46fa/219_1282_2705_3187/849.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Only 140,000 are left in the UK, from an original population of 3.5m\u2019: a red squirrel.\" width=\"849\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Only 140,000 are left in the UK, from an original population of 3.5m\u2019 \u2026 a red squirrel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Smart/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few miles north-west from the East Neuk of Fife I take the road to Dunkeld, gateway to highland Perthshire and home to a large population of red squirrels.

A mandarin duck watches from the tray of a nearby bird table, which creaks under its weight. Woodpeckers come and go, yellowhammers and siskins pop by for a snack.

Undulating fluorescent green fields and valleys fashioned into wide U-shapes by the ice age stretch out as far as the eye can see, dotted with rusty bracken and bluebells, vast skies overhead.

      "body": "<p>Kai Strittmatter is a German journalist who writes for <em>S\u00fcddeutsche </em><em>Zeitung</em> and is currently based in Copenhagen. From 1997 until recently, he had been a foreign correspondent in Beijing. Prior to those postings, he had studied sinology and journalism in Munich, Xi\u2019an and Taipei. So he knows China rather well. Having read his remarkable book, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that he will not be passing through any Chinese airport in the foreseeable future. Doing so would not be good for his health, not to mention his freedom.</p> <p><em>We Have Been Harmonised</em> is the most accessible and best informed account we have had to date of China\u2019s transition from what scholars such as Rebecca MacKinnon used to call \u201c<a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/427159\" title=\"\">networked authoritarianism</a>\u201d to what is now a form of networked totalitarianism. The difference is not merely semantic. An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism\" title=\"\">authoritarian regime</a> is relatively limited in its objectives: there may be elections, but they are generally carefully managed; individual freedoms are subordinate to the state; there is no constitutional accountability and no rule of law in any meaningful sense.</p> <p>Totalitarianism, in contrast, prohibits opposition parties, restricts opposition to the state and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. As the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/05/robert-conquest\" title=\"\">Robert Conquest</a> put it, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism\" title=\"\">totalitarian state</a> recognises no limits to its authority in any sphere of public or private life and seeks to extend that authority to whatever lengths it can.</p> <p>Which pretty well matches Strittmatter\u2019s portrayal of contemporary China under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, its new \u201cleader for life\u201d, who is increasingly looking like Mao 2.0 right down to his Little Red App as the contemporary version of his predecessor\u2019s Little Red Book. Mercifully, though, he does not seem to have Mao\u2019s enthusiasm for sacrificing millions of people on the altar of socialist rectitude. But, as Strittmatter tells it, under Xi\u2019s leadership the Communist party of China (CCP) has been closely following the totalitarian playbook as described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/01/totalitarianism-in-age-donald-trump-lessons-from-hannah-arendt-protests\" title=\"\">Hannah Arendt</a> and other observers of the phenomenon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more one reads, the more pressing one conclusion becomes: almost everything we thought we knew about China is wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first stage is to disconnect citizen/subjects from truth and reality. For this, it\u2019s necessary \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/11/georgeorwell.classics\" title=\"\">George Orwell</a> noted in <em>Politics and the English Language</em> \u2013 to invent a new language by appropriating the existing vernacular so that words cease to have their original meanings and take on interpretations more congenial to the state. The prime objective at this stage is not so much to deceive as to intimidate potential critics or opponents, such as journalists (purveyors of \u201cfake news\u201d) and judges (\u201cenemies of the people\u201d).</p> <p>Having hijacked language and legitimised lies, the next stage is to sow confusion. \u201cIf everybody always lies to you,\u201d Arendt once said, \u201cthe consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer.\u201d With such a people, she added, \u201cyou can then do what you please\u201d. This is made easier by deploying the coercive power of the state to eliminate dissent. In Xi\u2019s China this is largely done by using the law \u2013 which only applies to the subject, not the state.

      "bodyText": "Kai Strittmatter is a German journalist who writes for S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and is currently based in Copenhagen. From 1997 until recently, he had been a foreign correspondent in Beijing. Prior to those postings, he had studied sinology and journalism in Munich, Xi\u2019an and Taipei. So he knows China rather well. Having read his remarkable book, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that he will not be passing through any Chinese airport in the foreseeable future. Doing so would not be good for his health, not to mention his freedom. We Have Been Harmonised is the most accessible and best informed account we have had to date of China\u2019s transition from what scholars such as Rebecca MacKinnon used to call \u201cnetworked authoritarianism\u201d to what is now a form of networked totalitarianism. The difference is not merely semantic. An authoritarian regime is relatively limited in its objectives: there may be elections, but they are generally carefully managed; individual freedoms are subordinate to the state; there is no constitutional accountability and no rule of law in any meaningful sense. Totalitarianism, in contrast, prohibits opposition parties, restricts opposition to the state and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. As the historian Robert Conquest put it, a totalitarian state recognises no limits to its authority in any sphere of public or private life and seeks to extend that authority to whatever lengths it can. Which pretty well matches Strittmatter\u2019s portrayal of contemporary China under Xi Jinping, its new \u201cleader for life\u201d, who is increasingly looking like Mao 2.0 right down to his Little Red App as the contemporary version of his predecessor\u2019s Little Red Book. Mercifully, though, he does not seem to have Mao\u2019s enthusiasm for sacrificing millions of people on the altar of socialist rectitude. But, as Strittmatter tells it, under Xi\u2019s leadership the Communist party of China (CCP) has been closely following the totalitarian playbook as described by Hannah Arendt and other observers of the phenomenon. The first stage is to disconnect citizen/subjects from truth and reality. For this, it\u2019s necessary \u2013 as George Orwell noted in Politics and the English Language \u2013 to invent a new language by appropriating the existing vernacular so that words cease to have their original meanings and take on interpretations more congenial to the state. The prime objective at this stage is not so much to deceive as to intimidate potential critics or opponents, such as journalists (purveyors of \u201cfake news\u201d) and judges (\u201cenemies of the people\u201d). Having hijacked language and legitimised lies, the next stage is to sow confusion. \u201cIf everybody always lies to you,\u201d Arendt once said, \u201cthe consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer.\u201d With such a people, she added, \u201cyou can then do what you please\u201d. This is made easier by deploying the coercive power of the state to eliminate dissent. In Xi\u2019s China this is largely done by using the law \u2013 which only applies to the subject, not the state. In the old days this used to involve show trials; nowadays they are supplemented by televised \u201cconfessions\u201d. Strittmatter quotes a prize example from the humiliated CEO of Toutiao, the biggest news aggregator in the world. \u201cSince receiving the notice yesterday from regulatory authorities,\u201d the poor wretch bleats, \u201cI have been filled with remorse and guilt, entirely unable to sleep. I profoundly reflect on the fact that a deep-level cause of the problems in my company is a weak understanding and implementation of the four consciousnesses of Xi Jinping.\u201d Another requirement of totalitarians is the fostering of collective amnesia. The CCP seems to have been remarkably successful at this \u2013 which is why the recent anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre went entirely unmarked in China and why disasters that happened on the party\u2019s watch are systematically erased from the public record. All of this and much more is energetically related by Strittmatter. The more one reads, the more pressing one conclusion becomes: almost everything we thought we knew about contemporary China is wrong. And this has happened because the lenses through which we viewed this emerging superpower were distorted by arrogance, naivety, complacency, commercial greed and wishful thinking. We thought that if the Chinese wanted to modernise, they would have to have capitalism. And if they had capitalism, they would have to have democracy. And if they wanted to have the internet (and they did), they would have to have openness, which would eventually lead to democracy. All of which turned out to be baloney.

If you\u2019d prefer a multi-episode narrative, there are many. They usually divide into cleanly solved murders and cases that still feel ambiguous. The solved ones focus on why it took so long for the murderer to be caught. The ambiguous ones build a story that the authorities have got the wrong guy.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://culpablepodcast.com/\" title=\"\">Culpable</a></strong>, from the US, is one of the latter. This is a new, investigative, true-crime podcast that \u201cexplores unsettled cases where the people who seem deserving of blame have somehow eluded justice\u201d (now there\u2019s a sentence that has been bashed into submission by lawyers). The first three episodes of its debut series have come out. Classy, with an <em>S-Town</em>-like theme tune and sympathetic presenting from US journalist Dennis Cooper, this series takes a long, hard look at the 2014 death of Christian Andreacchio. Andreacchio, 21, from Mississippi, supposedly shot himself in his apartment. The police closed the case in 45 minutes (!) and the investigating officer did not respond \u2013 ever \u2013 to the Andreacchio family\u2019s repeated efforts to get in touch with him.</p> <p>The family did not think that Andreacchio killed himself. So they tried getting local newspapers and TV stations interested, to no avail. They weren\u2019t even permitted to do a <em>Three Billboards-</em>style ad campaign. Still, the Andreacchios kept hold of all the information they could: police reports, photos, notes, everything. They believed the truth would out.</p> <p><em>Culpable</em> is a careful podcast, and is respectful of the family. It spends the second episode delving into the life of Andreacchio himself, which seems correct. It\u2019s slow-moving, and you have to settle into its pacing, but it\u2019s shaping up to be an excellent show. I hope it results in something that relieves the family\u2019s distress.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/man-in-the-window/\" title=\"\">Man in the Window</a></strong> is very different. Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Paige St John is the show\u2019s researcher, writer and presenter, following the grim path of a Californian serial killer \u2013 the \u201cGolden State Killer\u201d \u2013 who raped and murdered his way through the 1970s and 80s. St John does an excellent job, but this is the type of podcast that I find difficult.</p> <p>Though she is careful to focus on the victims, this means that they simply get to tell an awful tale of rape, or near-rape, or of watching family members die in front of them. The show\u2019s sponsors, a home-security system, trade on the fear this engenders (<em>Culpable</em> also has adverts from a home security system). All true crime is there to scare you silly.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p071k0jv\" title=\"\">Paradise</a></strong>, from 5 Live, which has just finished, is less upsetting. It\u2019s a gripping, and thorough, re-examination of a 1978 murder case in which a couple of young Mancunians, Chris Farmer and Peta Frampton, went to Belize on holiday and ended up at the bottom of the sea. It\u2019s presented by the excellent Stephen Nolan and Daniel Maudsley; I could have done without Nolan moaning about the number of flights he had to take, while I\u2019m never quite convinced by reporters claiming a personal interest (Maudsley\u2019s nan\u2019s house was around the corner from where the couple grew up), but these are small niggles. This is a gripping tale, without the usual BBC structural and pacing problems, and it goes to places you don\u2019t expect.

Vivien Stone is \u2013 was \u2013 a Hollywood actor who was once, says the blurb, \u201call over the silver screen. Now she\u2019s all over the wall.\u201d Set on a film set in 1973, with requisite time-warp cast, is the murderer still on the loose? (Yes.) Packed with awful puns, the show\u2019s high jokes-per-minute ratio batters you into laughter. All eight episodes have been released at once, so this one\u2019s ripe for bingeing.",

Megalodon Thought to be the largest shark that ever lived, its remains have been found on every continent except Antarctica. Megalodon lived between 23m and 2.6m years ago. It grew up to 18 metres in length (the largest recorded great white shark is 6.1 metres). It was originally thought Megalodon died out because of falling sea temperatures linked to climate change. However, research conducted in 2016 has led scientists to conclude that the evolution of the food chain and increased competition may have been the primary factors in its extinction.",

The song used to be played by the BBC in gentler times as a celebration of diversity \u2013 I think the corporation was required by statute to use it in any segment mentioning the Windrush \u2013 and, since last year\u2019s scandals over attempted repatriation, replayed with a kind of silent nagging sarcasm. Because London <em>wasn\u2019t</em> the place for them (geddit?).</p> <p>Only meet, then, that it should have bookended David Olusoga\u2019s quietly excoriating documentary <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00068sk\" title=\"\">The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files</a></strong>, about the sly and slimy decades that preceded Theresa May\u2019s 2012-plus \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a>\u201d, which, no matter how inadvertently and croc-tear regrettably, caught in its web way too many Britons. They were only children when they arrived on His Majesty\u2019s troopship Empire Windrush (the clue\u2019s in the name; they were a part of empire), yet recent years have spun them, now in their 50s and having lived generally splendid (British) lives, into cycles of savage debt and depression. This was important \u2013 no, it was <em>crucial</em> \u2013 watching because, until this very week, in my slothful naivety, I hadn\u2019t truly appreciated the deep levels of historical racism within the British establishment, or press \u2013 and by extension its people \u2013 nor how swiftly a group can be \u201cothered\u201d by a few strokes of a pen, a few cry-wolf headlines. I, in my smugness, tend to congratulate myself on judging people purely by the cuts of their jib, but this was an eye-opener. Because what Olusoga, fast emerging as one of our smartest and kindest modern historians, did was take a teensy bit of all-too-justifiable anger but, quietly and painstakingly and with a minimum of shouty hand-waving from any of the participants, prove that a sizable minority of white people in government and in the press haven\u2019t ever, basically, much liked the idea of black people.</p> <p>It went back to Attlee. No government, left or right, was immune, post-Windrush and ankle-nipped by the press, to covert attempts to stem immigration while studiously <em>not</em> appearing to favour white, \u201csafe\u201d immigration. In 1962, under Macmillan, after a fractious 50s (Churchill had suggested fighting one election on the slogan Keep England White), they almost managed. That year\u2019s Commonwealth Immigrants Act, which promised a voucher scheme based on employment prospects, was greeted by Rab Butler \u2013 I\u2019d once thought him one of the good guys \u2013 as a \u201csad necessity\u201d but, his uncovered memo continued, \u201cthe great merit of this scheme is that it can be presented as making no distinction on grounds of race or colour but would in practice operate on people of colour almost exclusively\u201d. Searing, historically foul and, as I may have mentioned, personally eye-opening, this is what questing TV should be when it quests to change, or even nudge open, minds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedc6dae547486a8aedbac42d45698f9f39ce9d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedc6dae547486a8aedbac42d45698f9f39ce9d1/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Bateman and Dakota Blue Richards in Beecham House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jolly enough\u2019: Tom Bateman and Dakota Blue Richards in Beecham House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Right. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just going to be a big, fat racist now, but merely setting something among the doe-eyed maidens of 1790s India does not a cultural exploration make. You could have sloshed barefoot through the social/historical lessons of <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/beecham-house/2a5715a0001\" title=\"\">Beecham House</a> </strong>and kept your ankles dry. To be fair, it was surely never intended as much more than a Sunday night slice of high-end, sunny, exotic sari-ripping, and to that end it worked with some splendour.</p> <p>Yet there were the doleful expositions \u2013 I half-expected some misbegotten character to point out \u201cthis is, of course, almost 60 years before the Raj, or Crown Rule, came into India, thence to last till 1947\u201d; and the cliches. There was the angry male Indian. There was the docile and subservient female Indian. There was a Brit chap who stood as if inviting all ladies present to gaze longingly on his britches (one did, and she wasn\u2019t fly about it. No punjab intended). Only the nominal stars \u2013 Dakota Blue Richards, a much-missed placement in <em>Endeavour</em>, and one of the Toms or Rosses who frequently and occasionally shirtlessly adorn our Sunday nights (Hardy/Bateman/Poldark, in this case I think Bateman) \u2013 had any character whatsoever to play with.</p> <p>For all that, it\u2019s jolly enough. Think of it as <em>Death in Paradise</em> with a much bigger budget, a lot more elephants and, hard though this may be to imagine, more credible acting.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0004hty\" title=\"\">The Looming Tower</a></strong> drew to its unconscionable climax. The towers fell. (Or did they? Hmm. That\u2019s a question. The answer is yes, as it should be, for example, to: \u201cWould it be a good idea to make children much safer with a small lifelong injection?\u201d) Among other aspects this phenomenal series has revealed is the urgent love with which America has (still) always serenaded Saudi Arabia. The CIA\u2019s mantra was \u201cSaudi shall simply never go down\u201d. The grubby politicking between the CIA and FBI has never been more gruesomely portrayed; despite the fine brushed-clean homeland desks of both agencies, you couldn\u2019t help but itch to want to scrub your fingernails and run from the room, sobbing for a, or indeed any, truth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bff7d199668ee22ab778d32a2075c9025e839a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bff7d199668ee22ab778d32a2075c9025e839a1/0_288_4282_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeff Daniels in The Looming Tower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018standout\u2019 Jeff Daniels in The Looming Tower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JoJo Whilden/BBC/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jeff Daniels and Tahar Rahim have been standout in their flawed but simple empathy for other human beings.

      "bodyText": "The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files (BBC Two) | iPlayer Beecham House (ITV) | ITV Hub The Looming Tower (BBC Two) | iPlayer The Lawyer (Channel 4) | All 4 Aldwyn Roberts is not the best known name in musical history. But, as \u201cLord Kitchener\u201d, who in 1948 sang the first two stanzas of London Is the Place for Me for reporters on Tilbury docks bad-dancing to calypso, his is a name that deserves its place in any history of British racism. The song used to be played by the BBC in gentler times as a celebration of diversity \u2013 I think the corporation was required by statute to use it in any segment mentioning the Windrush \u2013 and, since last year\u2019s scandals over attempted repatriation, replayed with a kind of silent nagging sarcasm. Because London wasn\u2019t the place for them (geddit?). Only meet, then, that it should have bookended David Olusoga\u2019s quietly excoriating documentary The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files, about the sly and slimy decades that preceded Theresa May\u2019s 2012-plus \u201chostile environment\u201d, which, no matter how inadvertently and croc-tear regrettably, caught in its web way too many Britons. They were only children when they arrived on His Majesty\u2019s troopship Empire Windrush (the clue\u2019s in the name; they were a part of empire), yet recent years have spun them, now in their 50s and having lived generally splendid (British) lives, into cycles of savage debt and depression. This was important \u2013 no, it was crucial \u2013 watching because, until this very week, in my slothful naivety, I hadn\u2019t truly appreciated the deep levels of historical racism within the British establishment, or press \u2013 and by extension its people \u2013 nor how swiftly a group can be \u201cothered\u201d by a few strokes of a pen, a few cry-wolf headlines. I, in my smugness, tend to congratulate myself on judging people purely by the cuts of their jib, but this was an eye-opener. Because what Olusoga, fast emerging as one of our smartest and kindest modern historians, did was take a teensy bit of all-too-justifiable anger but, quietly and painstakingly and with a minimum of shouty hand-waving from any of the participants, prove that a sizable minority of white people in government and in the press haven\u2019t ever, basically, much liked the idea of black people. It went back to Attlee. No government, left or right, was immune, post-Windrush and ankle-nipped by the press, to covert attempts to stem immigration while studiously not appearing to favour white, \u201csafe\u201d immigration. In 1962, under Macmillan, after a fractious 50s (Churchill had suggested fighting one election on the slogan Keep England White), they almost managed. That year\u2019s Commonwealth Immigrants Act, which promised a voucher scheme based on employment prospects, was greeted by Rab Butler \u2013 I\u2019d once thought him one of the good guys \u2013 as a \u201csad necessity\u201d but, his uncovered memo continued, \u201cthe great merit of this scheme is that it can be presented as making no distinction on grounds of race or colour but would in practice operate on people of colour almost exclusively\u201d. Searing, historically foul and, as I may have mentioned, personally eye-opening, this is what questing TV should be when it quests to change, or even nudge open, minds. Right. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just going to be a big, fat racist now, but merely setting something among the doe-eyed maidens of 1790s India does not a cultural exploration make. You could have sloshed barefoot through the social/historical lessons of Beecham House and kept your ankles dry. To be fair, it was surely never intended as much more than a Sunday night slice of high-end, sunny, exotic sari-ripping, and to that end it worked with some splendour. Yet there were the doleful expositions \u2013 I half-expected some misbegotten character to point out \u201cthis is, of course, almost 60 years before the Raj, or Crown Rule, came into India, thence to last till 1947\u201d; and the cliches. There was the angry male Indian. There was the docile and subservient female Indian. There was a Brit chap who stood as if inviting all ladies present to gaze longingly on his britches (one did, and she wasn\u2019t fly about it. No punjab intended). Only the nominal stars \u2013 Dakota Blue Richards, a much-missed placement in Endeavour, and one of the Toms or Rosses who frequently and occasionally shirtlessly adorn our Sunday nights (Hardy/Bateman/Poldark, in this case I think Bateman) \u2013 had any character whatsoever to play with. For all that, it\u2019s jolly enough. Think of it as Death in Paradise with a much bigger budget, a lot more elephants and, hard though this may be to imagine, more credible acting. The Looming Tower drew to its unconscionable climax. The towers fell. (Or did they? Hmm. That\u2019s a question. The answer is yes, as it should be, for example, to: \u201cWould it be a good idea to make children much safer with a small lifelong injection?\u201d) Among other aspects this phenomenal series has revealed is the urgent love with which America has (still) always serenaded Saudi Arabia. The CIA\u2019s mantra was \u201cSaudi shall simply never go down\u201d. The grubby politicking between the CIA and FBI has never been more gruesomely portrayed; despite the fine brushed-clean homeland desks of both agencies, you couldn\u2019t help but itch to want to scrub your fingernails and run from the room, sobbing for a, or indeed any, truth. Jeff Daniels and Tahar Rahim have been standout in their flawed but simple empathy for other human beings. Oddly for this age, women got a bum rap: Condoleezza Rice and the female-heavy CIA team who denied shared intelligence are proof if proof were needed that, when it comes to gender, the capacity to attain dickhood is fluid. Rather terrific all round, and such a lump in the throat at the realisation that Daniels\u2019s John O\u2019Neill really did go down with the towers: but it\u2019s hard to entirely celebrate a series that I so savagely wish hadn\u2019t had to be made. If only\u2026 can there be two more lonesome mournful words? The Lawyer, a new thing from that grand Walter Presents strand, is a deeply moreish Scando-thriller, just not in that vein. No psychological angst, no sex-jerseys, no dark nights of the soul or chess-bouts with Death: a simple Danish-Swedish mafia potboiler, heavy with trips across that bridge and beetle-browed menace and damned fine Ikea apartments: you\u2019ll love it.",

These facilities are designed for short-term stays \u2013 some are tents or converted warehouses \u2013 because the system functions primarily to process single male workers. The facilities are so ill-equipped for the detention of children that CBP cannot hold unaccompanied minors, anyone under 18 who is not with a parent or legal guardian, for more than 72 hours. After that period, CBP is supposed to release such migrants to the Office of Refugee and Resettlement (ORR), an agency within the federal Department of Health and Human Services, which matches them with shelters. A group of volunteer lawyers and doctors granted access to border patrol facilities as part of ongoing litigation against the US government found children were being held at processing facilities beyond 72 hours. Some had been there for more than two weeks. On 27 June the group filed a lawsuit against the federal government for violating the Flores agreement \u2013 a legal protection that guarantees migrant children be kept in safe and sanitary conditions \u2013 and demanded immediate inspection of processing centers by public health officials, to \u201cprevent more illnesses and deaths at the border\u201d. In testimony, children at one processing facility in Clint, Texas said they were not being given soap or toothbrushes. Some said they were sleeping on the concrete floor. Others slept in overcrowded cells next to open toilets. In a cell that held 45, six minors including four under the age of two got lice. Two combs were passed around for uninfected children to share. Clothes were covered in mucus, vomit and, for young teenage mothers, breast milk. Time outside was rare: one young boy told a lawyer he looked forward to when the CBP officer came into the cell to clean, as he and the other kids could then play in the hallway. \u201cMy daughter and I have been sleeping on the floor with just a blanket, no mattress for two weeks,\u201d testified a 17-year-old mother from Guatemala in court documents. \u201cI am in a \u2018girls only\u2019 cell, with a toilet separated by a partial wall. The girls help each other by holding up blanket for some privacy when we go to the bathroom.\u201d Five minors have died in US custody after crossing the border. Most recently, in May, a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala died after he got the flu at a border patrol processing center in McAllen, Texas. Two days later, CBP announced that three-dozen migrants were quarantined with the flu at the center. \u201cIt\u2019s profoundly dystopian to think that in 2019 this is being done in the hands of the United States,\u201d said Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University, who visited the facilities earlier this month. A majority of the children interviewed at the Clint facility had been separated from their familial guardians, Binford said. Trump ended his blanketed \u201czero tolerance\u201d family separation policy after intense backlash and issued an executive order that said the federal government would prioritize family unity. But the order, currently in litigation, still gives the government the right to separate children from their families \u201cwhere appropriate and consistent with law and available resources\u201d. The Trump administration has also shut down avenues out of detention, cancelling a refugee program for children traveling from Central America and no longer allowing migrants to stay with family or community members until their asylum court hearing. Previously, CBP would only detain those \u201cwho they have a reason to believe would be a risk to public safety or a flight risk\u201d, said Bran\u00e9, of the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission. The Trump administration, she added, does \u201cthe reverse: they detain everybody they possibly can until they have no beds left.\u201d Asylum seekers such as Baby K and her mother remain trapped in limbo as processing centers overflow. This backlog and paralysis is \u201cintentional\u201d, Bran\u00e9 said, adding that the administration\u2019s strategy has \u201cbeen very clear from the moment [they] came in to power: make the conditions untenable so that people will not come. Punish, and deter people from requesting asylum\u201d. \u2018Political pawns\u2019 Experts say there is a political gain for Trump when he creates a backlog at the border. Hardline immigration policies are popular with Republicans: in a CNN poll conducted last summer, 58% of Republicans polled said they approved of family separation. \u201cIf it looks like our border is being overrun, there\u2019s going to be a lot more political will for some of the president\u2019s political goals, which is building walls [and] limiting all kinds of immigration,\u201d said Jennifer Podkul, senior director for policy and advocacy at Kids in Need of Defense, a human rights not-for-profit group. \u201cThis administration has used immigrants as political pawns since day one.\u201d Crowded and unsanitary conditions in shelters, Bran\u00e9 said, are the logical result of the administration\u2019s choices, not an issue of funding. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the children don\u2019t have soap and toothbrushes because the border patrol cannot afford soap and toothbrushes. The situation is that CBP does not want to provide those things.\u201d CBP officials have denied the lawyers\u2019 reports about the Clint facility and Trump has refused to take responsibility for it conditions, pushing the blame on to Congress. \u201cThe laws are so bad and the asylum rules and laws are so bad that our border patrol people, who are so incredible, aren\u2019t allowed to do their jobs,\u201d the president told reporters on Tuesday. But disturbing details reported from Clint and a graphic photo of a father and daughter drowned while crossing the Rio Grande have stoked outrage in Washington, leading to the resignation of the acting head of the CBP, John Sanders. On Thursday, Congress allocated $4.5bn in supplemental funding to border. It passed despite concern from House progressives that the measure did not include accountability measures for the Trump administration.",

The tiny cohort of privately educated people is not two or three times more likely than the comprehensively educated to end up in influential jobs: the figure is a massive <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Elitist-Britain-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">12 times</a>. So defenders of the status quo are arguing that the privately educated are twelvefold more qualified to be ministers, news editors and diplomats. It\u2019s ludicrous and insulting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The left seems content to combine a moral distaste for parents who go private with a timidity for disrupting the system</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>These figures, which have barely budged in years, prompt a mix of guilt and frustration in me. Guilt because, as someone who went to a private school, I\u2019m uncomfortably aware I\u2019m a symptom of this elitism. Frustration because the solutions we jump to \u2013 slightly lower university requirements for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ey-blind-cv-policy-diversity-workforce-ernst-and-young-trainee-job-applications-academic-education-a7558696.html\" title=\"\">\u201cblind\u201d CV recruitment</a> \u2013 feel like tinkering around the edges.</p> \n<p>You might think that dismantling a system that unfairly benefits just 7% of children \u2013 the extra resources that get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/public-schools-david-kynaston-francis-green-engines-of-privilege\" title=\"\">ploughed into their education</a>, the self-assurance and confidence it instils, the access to the old boys\u2019 network that going to a school such as Eton or Winchester opens \u2013 might be quite popular with the parents of the 93%. But the <a href=\"https://www.isc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Independent Schools Council</a> often wheels out the stat that in one of its surveys, almost six in 10 parents said they would send their child to an <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9667752/More-parents-would-opt-for-an-independent-school.html\" title=\"\">independent school</a> if they could afford to. Despite evidence to the contrary, Brits generally believe we inhabit a meritocracy: in 2012, 84% of people said they thought hard work is essential or very important to getting on in life; just one in three thought the same of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.natcen.ac.uk/blog/what-will-create-a-fairer-society\" title=\"\">knowing the right people</a>.</p> \n<p>We\u2019ve all got a stake in maintaining that illusion. People at the top like to believe they made it there through hard work and talent, not luck and privilege. For the rest, there\u2019s the promise of the possible inherent in the belief that we live in a meritocracy.</p> \n<p>Perhaps this is why even as the left professes its commitment to dismantling privilege, it seems content to combine a moral distaste for parents who go private with a timidity for actually disrupting the system. Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto was a <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/education/\" title=\"\">damp education squib</a>. It proposed charging VAT on private school fees \u2013 floated by Michael Gove a few months earlier, hardly very radical. Its flagship pledge wasn\u2019t to expand the almost <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/805127/Review_of_post_18_education_and_funding.pdf\" title=\"\">\u00a330k average subsidy</a> the disproportionately middle-class young people who go to university get to the disproportionately working-class young people who don\u2019t, but to increase the gap further by scrapping tuition fees altogether. It said nothing about the robust reform needed to a school admissions system that allows more affluent parents to dominate the best state schools via the housing market: houses near top comprehensives attract an average premium of <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/research-paper/selective-comprehensives-2017-state-school-attainment/\" title=\"\">more than \u00a345,000</a>.</p> \n<p>You can\u2019t blame parents for wanting to do what they see as best by their children. The paradox of the Sutton Trust report is that, even as it highlights a huge social problem, it also underlines the great advantage conferred by attending a top public school, followed by an <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Elitist-Britain-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">elite university</a>, in charting a route to career success.

      "bodyText": "The headmaster of Stowe was greeted with utter incredulity a few weeks ago when he publicly worried that his pupils were victims of social engineering. New figures out last week from the Sutton Trust remind us why his musings were so absurd. The tiny cohort of privately educated people is not two or three times more likely than the comprehensively educated to end up in influential jobs: the figure is a massive 12 times. So defenders of the status quo are arguing that the privately educated are twelvefold more qualified to be ministers, news editors and diplomats. It\u2019s ludicrous and insulting. These figures, which have barely budged in years, prompt a mix of guilt and frustration in me. Guilt because, as someone who went to a private school, I\u2019m uncomfortably aware I\u2019m a symptom of this elitism. Frustration because the solutions we jump to \u2013 slightly lower university requirements for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, \u201cblind\u201d CV recruitment \u2013 feel like tinkering around the edges. You might think that dismantling a system that unfairly benefits just 7% of children \u2013 the extra resources that get ploughed into their education, the self-assurance and confidence it instils, the access to the old boys\u2019 network that going to a school such as Eton or Winchester opens \u2013 might be quite popular with the parents of the 93%. But the Independent Schools Council often wheels out the stat that in one of its surveys, almost six in 10 parents said they would send their child to an independent school if they could afford to. Despite evidence to the contrary, Brits generally believe we inhabit a meritocracy: in 2012, 84% of people said they thought hard work is essential or very important to getting on in life; just one in three thought the same of \u201cknowing the right people. We\u2019ve all got a stake in maintaining that illusion. People at the top like to believe they made it there through hard work and talent, not luck and privilege. For the rest, there\u2019s the promise of the possible inherent in the belief that we live in a meritocracy. Perhaps this is why even as the left professes its commitment to dismantling privilege, it seems content to combine a moral distaste for parents who go private with a timidity for actually disrupting the system. Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto was a damp education squib. It proposed charging VAT on private school fees \u2013 floated by Michael Gove a few months earlier, hardly very radical. Its flagship pledge wasn\u2019t to expand the almost \u00a330k average subsidy the disproportionately middle-class young people who go to university get to the disproportionately working-class young people who don\u2019t, but to increase the gap further by scrapping tuition fees altogether. It said nothing about the robust reform needed to a school admissions system that allows more affluent parents to dominate the best state schools via the housing market: houses near top comprehensives attract an average premium of more than \u00a345,000. You can\u2019t blame parents for wanting to do what they see as best by their children. The paradox of the Sutton Trust report is that, even as it highlights a huge social problem, it also underlines the great advantage conferred by attending a top public school, followed by an elite university, in charting a route to career success. And so the problem becomes self-perpetuating. It\u2019s precisely because you can\u2019t expect parents to make the most socially beneficial decisions that more radical government intervention is needed. There\u2019s always the nuclear option of effectively scrapping private schools by banning them from charging fees, as Finland did in the 1970s (it now has one of the most equitable and high-performing school systems in the world). But if that\u2019s deemed impossible, government can seek to break the golden thread of privilege that connects private schools to the elite professions via top universities. Progress in widening access has been glacial \u2013 between 2010 and 2015, just 6% of Oxbridge admissions were to young people with parents in unskilled and semi-skilled work, despite these social classes constituting a quarter of the population. Universities have been far too slow to recognise that it\u2019s hardly an equivalent achievement to get three As at A-level if your parents went to Oxbridge than if you\u2019re the first in your family to go to university. I\u2019ve become convinced it\u2019s time to force them to act, with quotas that would stipulate the proportion of students the most selective universities must take from working-class backgrounds. Suddenly, a private education becomes less of a surefire bet. You could even make it more obvious to parents by flipping quotas on their head into a \u201cprivilege cap\u201d on the proportion of privately educated young people our publicly funded universities can take. Or we could go even further by moving towards a more comprehensive-style university system.

There will be beans and sweet peas. And peace of mind. Order Morning: How to Make Time by Allan Jenkins, for \u00a37.91, from guardianbookshop.com",

A face scrub that isn\u2019t actually a scrub at all</h2> <p>I recoil in horror when anyone tells me that they use face scrubs. The problem is that most are badly formulated and most people over-scrub, creating micro tears in the skin so, essentially, you end up with worse skin than you had to start with. So my response to \u2018Should I be using a face scrub?\u2019 is always a reverberating no. If you need to exfoliate, I suggest using a liquid exfoliator. Still, I accept that some women just like a scrub. So if you must use one, try this.</p> <p>Paula Begoun, the founder and formulator behind it, is known for her frankness concerning products and formulations. She famously calls out beauty BS and what she doesn\u2019t know about skincare could fit on the top of a pipette. She is the only person who could have convinced me to even contemplate a \u2018scrub\u2019. Why? Because this doesn\u2019t actually \u2018scrub\u2019. It is a mild, super-gentle skin-softening cleanser/scrub hybrid with jojoba beads that completely disintegrate as you rub them into your skin.</p> <p>If you\u2019re wearing heavy makeup, it\u2019s worth taking it off first and, no, it won\u2019t replace a liquid exfoliation. However, you will have softer, irritation-free skin because this scrub,that doesn\u2019t really scrub, ensures you could never over scrub.

A face scrub that isn\u2019t actually a scrub at all I recoil in horror when anyone tells me that they use face scrubs. The problem is that most are badly formulated and most people over-scrub, creating micro tears in the skin so, essentially, you end up with worse skin than you had to start with. So my response to \u2018Should I be using a face scrub?\u2019 is always a reverberating no. If you need to exfoliate, I suggest using a liquid exfoliator. Still, I accept that some women just like a scrub. So if you must use one, try this. Paula Begoun, the founder and formulator behind it, is known for her frankness concerning products and formulations. She famously calls out beauty BS and what she doesn\u2019t know about skincare could fit on the top of a pipette. She is the only person who could have convinced me to even contemplate a \u2018scrub\u2019. Why? Because this doesn\u2019t actually \u2018scrub\u2019. It is a mild, super-gentle skin-softening cleanser/scrub hybrid with jojoba beads that completely disintegrate as you rub them into your skin. If you\u2019re wearing heavy makeup, it\u2019s worth taking it off first and, no, it won\u2019t replace a liquid exfoliation. However, you will have softer, irritation-free skin because this scrub,that doesn\u2019t really scrub, ensures you could never over scrub. Clever.

Many have wondered what Lincoln might say if confronted by the people and events of their time.

But we do not have to wonder what Lincoln might say about demagogic exploitation of the Fourth of July or hypocritical displays about the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. His statements on the subject were voluminous, plain and scathing.</p> <p>Here is a small sample:</p> <p>To a friend, <a href=\"https://digital.lib.niu.edu/islandora/object/niu-lincoln%3A38241\">15 August 1855</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the question of liberty, as a principle, we are not what we have been. When we were the political slaves of King George, and wanted to be free, we called the maxim that \u2018all men are created equal,\u2019 a self-evident truth; but now when we have grown fat, and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves, we have become so greedy to be <em>masters</em> that we call the same maxim \u2018a self-evident lie.\u2019 The Fourth of July has not quite dwindled away; it is still a great day \u2013 <em>for burning fire-crackers!!!</em></p> </blockquote> <p>More than the expropriation of Independence Day to justify slavery agitated Lincoln. A week later, <a href=\"https://digital.lib.niu.edu/islandora/object/niu-lincoln%3A37508\">on 24 August</a>, he wrote his close friend Joshua Speed to complain about the rising anti-immigrant, nativist and super-patriotic Know Nothing party as a duplicitous mockery of the Declaration of Independence:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a nation, we began by declaring that \u2018<em>all men are created equal</em>.\u2019 We now practically read it \u2018all men are created equal, <em>except negroes</em>.\u2019 When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes, <em>and foreigners, and Catholics</em>.\u2019 When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.</p> </blockquote> <p>During his famous debates with the racist demagogue Stephen A Douglas in 1858, Lincoln ridiculed Douglas\u2019s denial that the Declaration stood for human equality. In notes preparing for those debates, Lincoln spelled out what both supporters of slavery and those calculatingly indifferent to it were doing, which was:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 to subvert, in the public mind, and in practical administration, our old and only standard of free government, that \u2018all men are created equal,\u2019 and to substitute for it some different standard. What that substitute is to be is not difficult to perceive. It is to deny the equality of men, and to assert the natural, moral, and religious right of one class to enslave another.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>In February 1861, after his election as president, on his way to Washington, Lincoln spoke at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and <a href=\"https://digital.lib.niu.edu/islandora/object/niu-lincoln%3A37124\">declared</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence \u2026 If [the country] can\u2019t be saved upon that principle, it will be truly awful.

      "bodyText": "It is a rare, desperate day that I can eat white chocolate; although melted into warm cream, chilled, then whipped, Green &amp; Black\u2019s White Cooking Chocolate (150g, \u00a32.50) makes a stunning eclair filling. Or you can use it to make your own squirty cream, by piling it into an icing bag with a tube star attachment and squirting it straight into your children\u2019s mouths. You\u2019ve never seen a quicker line-up than when offering this. Luckily, white chocolate has undergone a major rehabilitation in recent years. Rococo\u2019s Lemon and Poppyseed (70g, \u00a35.95) has an exquisite lemon zing and poppyseed crunch, if they could just ramp down the sugar. Its 32% Blonde (70g, \u00a35.95) version \u2013 where sugar isn\u2019t the first ingredient \u2013 is better. Hotel Chocolat\u2019s Mint White (100g, \u00a33.95) has the excitement of mint crystals and peppermint oil, which stops it being too cloying. My favourite, however, was Artisan du Chocolat\u2019s Creamy Mascarpone (45g, \u00a33.95), which is white chocolate with actual mascarpone cheese in it. This lends it a super-creamy taste that I went back for. But then something happened that blew my mind. Pump Street\u2019s 40% Brown Bread (70g, \u00a36.25). I was happily munching through it thinking it was regular milk, until I realised it is actually white chocolate in dark clothing: thanks to a touch of cocoa powder and brown bread crumbs. Now I don\u2019t know what to think. If all else fails, the baker Dan Lepard recommends adding melted white chocolate into tea cake-bakes to give a softer crumb. It works, too.",

In some countries, such as Russia or Brazil, attitudes to immigration or gay rights may have hardened. But in others, including Britain, social attitudes have become more liberal, even as they have become more polarised. In Donald Trump\u2019s America, for instance, people have become <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/4-race-immigration-and- discrimination/4_9-3/\" title=\"\">more supportive of immigration, but also more partisan</a>.</p> <p>But however warped Putin\u2019s vision of liberalism, it is incontestably facing challenges it rarely has before. From America to the Philippines, the rise of populist movements reveals a yearning for belonging and identity that liberalism cannot satisfy. The emergence of non-liberal economic powers such as China calls into question the postwar \u201cliberal order\u201d. Putin, <em>FT</em> editor, Lionel Barber, told Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, \u201cfeels he is on the right side of history\u201d. Many liberals fear that, too. Hence the global impact of Putin\u2019s comments.</p> <p>The real issue, though, is not that social attitudes have become more illiberal, but that liberalism has been unable to address the fundamental issue of the relationship between the individual and society even as that issue has become one of the most salient.</p> <p>As a philosophy, liberalism exists in many, often competing, forms. At the heart of most forms, however, stands the individual. Humans, wrote John Locke, the 17th-century philosophical founder of liberalism, naturally exist in \u201ca State of perfect Freedom to order their Actions\u2026 without asking leave, or depending on the Will of any other Man\u201d.</p> <p>Classically, liberals held that society comprises free individuals who come together in voluntary rational agreement. Any restraint placed on an individual\u2019s liberty, including the right to own property, had to be both justified and minimal.</p> <p>Critics pointed out that humans do not live merely as individuals. We are social beings and find our individuality and discover meaning only through others. Hence the importance to political life not just of individuals but also of communities and collectives.</p> <p>The critique of liberal individualism adopted both conservative and radical garb.</p> <p>Conservatives saw history, tradition and the nation as the means by which the individual became part of a greater whole. A nation, as Edmund Burke, the founder of modern conservatism, wrote, is found not just in a set of values but also in \u201can idea of continuity, which extends in time as well as in numbers and in space\u201d.</p> <p>For radical critics of liberalism, particularly socialists and Marxists, an individual realised himself or herself not through tradition but rather through struggles to transform society, from battles for decent working conditions to campaigns for equal rights. These struggles created organisations, such as trade unions and civil rights movements, which drew individuals into new modes of collective life and forged new forms of belonging and common purpose.</p> <p>Conservative and radical ways of thinking about belonging have long coexisted in tension. The idea of a community or of a nation inevitably draws upon a past that has shaped its present. But the existence of movements for social change transforms the meaning of the past and of the ways in which one thinks of identity. \u201cBritain\u201d or \u201cRussia\u201d means something different if defined in terms of what we want the nation to be, rather than just of what it has been.</p> <p>The tension between liberalism and radicalism has been even more important. Liberalism ensured that the issue of individual rights and liberties remained central to many strands of the left, even as socialists rejected liberal notions of private property. Radicalism injected into liberalism a social conscience. Over time, many strands of liberalism modified both the classical attachment to private property as sacrosanct and the distaste for state intervention.</p> <p>The relationship between liberalism, radicalism and conservatism began to change in the last decades of the 20th century, largely as the left disintegrated. The idea of an alternative to capitalism seemed to many chimerical, more so after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Even before the Berlin Wall had come down, a new kind of economic liberalism, unstitched from the restraints of social need, had emerged \u2013 what many now call \u201cneoliberalism\u201d. At its core was a philosophy of deregulation, privatisation and the introduction of market forces into virtually every nook and cranny of social life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4763c07ef3279717ed8a9cf223ef8131d2ebd498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4763c07ef3279717ed8a9cf223ef8131d2ebd498/0_165_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People React To Election Results In USA Supporters of Republican nominee for President Donald Trump react to returns as the come in on televisions around the room on Election Day of the 2016 US Trump supporters cheer as the results of the 2016 presidential election come in\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In 2016, just a quarter of Trump voters thought their candidate had \u201cgood judgment\u201d but four out of five thought he could \u201cbring about change\u201d.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the organisations that had provided working-class people with hope and dignity crumbled. Trade unions were crushed and radical social movements eroded. Societies became atomised and much of the social architecture essential for people to flourish was dismantled. It was a process not confined to the west, but visible across the globe.</p> <p>Against this background, many of those looking to recreate a sense of social solidarity have been drawn to conservative, even reactionary, ideas of belonging, rooted in nation, tradition and race. And, in an age in which there exist few transformative social movements, many have turned to strongmen to do the job. In the 2016 US presidential elections, just a quarter of Trump voters thought their candidate had \u201cgood judgment\u201d, but four out of five thought he could \u201cbring about change\u201d. Much the same is true of authoritarian leaders across the globe, from Putin to Erdo\u011fan, from Salvini to Duterte.</p> <p>The irony is that the problem faced by liberalism is less the retrenchment of social liberalism than that the retreat of the left has allowed for the success of the ugly side of individualism. The irony, too, is that what is exposed by this is not simply a problem for liberalism, but an even bigger problem for the left.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an <em>Observer </em>columnist</p>",

The real issue, though, is not that social attitudes have become more illiberal, but that liberalism has been unable to address the fundamental issue of the relationship between the individual and society even as that issue has become one of the most salient. As a philosophy, liberalism exists in many, often competing, forms. At the heart of most forms, however, stands the individual. Humans, wrote John Locke, the 17th-century philosophical founder of liberalism, naturally exist in \u201ca State of perfect Freedom to order their Actions\u2026 without asking leave, or depending on the Will of any other Man\u201d. Classically, liberals held that society comprises free individuals who come together in voluntary rational agreement. Any restraint placed on an individual\u2019s liberty, including the right to own property, had to be both justified and minimal. Critics pointed out that humans do not live merely as individuals. We are social beings and find our individuality and discover meaning only through others. Hence the importance to political life not just of individuals but also of communities and collectives. The critique of liberal individualism adopted both conservative and radical garb. Conservatives saw history, tradition and the nation as the means by which the individual became part of a greater whole. A nation, as Edmund Burke, the founder of modern conservatism, wrote, is found not just in a set of values but also in \u201can idea of continuity, which extends in time as well as in numbers and in space\u201d. For radical critics of liberalism, particularly socialists and Marxists, an individual realised himself or herself not through tradition but rather through struggles to transform society, from battles for decent working conditions to campaigns for equal rights. These struggles created organisations, such as trade unions and civil rights movements, which drew individuals into new modes of collective life and forged new forms of belonging and common purpose. Conservative and radical ways of thinking about belonging have long coexisted in tension. The idea of a community or of a nation inevitably draws upon a past that has shaped its present. But the existence of movements for social change transforms the meaning of the past and of the ways in which one thinks of identity. \u201cBritain\u201d or \u201cRussia\u201d means something different if defined in terms of what we want the nation to be, rather than just of what it has been. The tension between liberalism and radicalism has been even more important. Liberalism ensured that the issue of individual rights and liberties remained central to many strands of the left, even as socialists rejected liberal notions of private property. Radicalism injected into liberalism a social conscience. Over time, many strands of liberalism modified both the classical attachment to private property as sacrosanct and the distaste for state intervention. The relationship between liberalism, radicalism and conservatism began to change in the last decades of the 20th century, largely as the left disintegrated. The idea of an alternative to capitalism seemed to many chimerical, more so after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even before the Berlin Wall had come down, a new kind of economic liberalism, unstitched from the restraints of social need, had emerged \u2013 what many now call \u201cneoliberalism\u201d. At its core was a philosophy of deregulation, privatisation and the introduction of market forces into virtually every nook and cranny of social life. At the same time, the organisations that had provided working-class people with hope and dignity crumbled. Trade unions were crushed and radical social movements eroded. Societies became atomised and much of the social architecture essential for people to flourish was dismantled. It was a process not confined to the west, but visible across the globe. Against this background, many of those looking to recreate a sense of social solidarity have been drawn to conservative, even reactionary, ideas of belonging, rooted in nation, tradition and race. And, in an age in which there exist few transformative social movements, many have turned to strongmen to do the job. In the 2016 US presidential elections, just a quarter of Trump voters thought their candidate had \u201cgood judgment\u201d, but four out of five thought he could \u201cbring about change\u201d. Much the same is true of authoritarian leaders across the globe, from Putin to Erdo\u011fan, from Salvini to Duterte. The irony is that the problem faced by liberalism is less the retrenchment of social liberalism than that the retreat of the left has allowed for the success of the ugly side of individualism. The irony, too, is that what is exposed by this is not simply a problem for liberalism, but an even bigger problem for the left. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

Almost all the record-breaking \u00a3126m in penalties imposed on the company last week by Ofwat, its regulator, was to compensate the region\u2019s 4.3m residents for the dirty, untreated water that flowed into rivers, streams and onto beaches.</p> <p>Southern\u2019s managers, who covered up leaks at treatment plants from Kent to Hampshire, are a gift for those who believe it is time to end a 30-year experiment in privatisation and take all the water companies into public ownership.</p> <p>Until now, campaigners have focused on the raw deal given to customers, who must pay through the nose to a private monopoly provider. Loaded with debt by their owners, the water companies must use most of their income to pay the interest, while the rest is paid out of profits to shareholders. Deteriorating networks are maintained to the very minimum insisted on by the regulator. Properly treated water at a fair price is something the privatised industry constantly fails to provide.</p> <p>Now that Europe is sweltering in record-breaking heat, a second front is opening up against the water companies. And this centres on the investment needed, not just to replace leaking pipes but to support efforts to tackle the climate emergency.</p> <p>Even in Britain, water is becoming a scarce resource. In the torrential storms that have become increasingly prevalent, the water runs off the land, into rivers, rages through town centres and out to sea. Parts of the country need more reservoirs, which means giving over land near cities that might otherwise be farmed, left fallow for wildlife or used for some form of development. Where aquifers are running dry due to overextraction, public bodies need to decide on the priorities, juggling the competing demands of farmers, local businesses and households.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0abc377e11895df0d330056008b692514f36f372\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0abc377e11895df0d330056008b692514f36f372/146_559_2479_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A water depth marker stands on dry ground at a reservoir in central England, in February 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Even in Britain, water is becoming a scarce resource.\u2019 A water depth marker stands on dry ground at a reservoir in central England, in February 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Polluted rivers must be cleaned up and that can only come about when there is more pressure on farmers to stop putting so much nitrogen and phosphorous on the land.</p> <p>Treatment plants must be upgraded, as Southern Water will need to do.

      "bodyText": "A smelly sewage works in Southampton was the least of Southern Water\u2019s misdemeanours. Almost all the record-breaking \u00a3126m in penalties imposed on the company last week by Ofwat, its regulator, was to compensate the region\u2019s 4.3m residents for the dirty, untreated water that flowed into rivers, streams and onto beaches. Southern\u2019s managers, who covered up leaks at treatment plants from Kent to Hampshire, are a gift for those who believe it is time to end a 30-year experiment in privatisation and take all the water companies into public ownership. Until now, campaigners have focused on the raw deal given to customers, who must pay through the nose to a private monopoly provider. Loaded with debt by their owners, the water companies must use most of their income to pay the interest, while the rest is paid out of profits to shareholders. Deteriorating networks are maintained to the very minimum insisted on by the regulator. Properly treated water at a fair price is something the privatised industry constantly fails to provide. Now that Europe is sweltering in record-breaking heat, a second front is opening up against the water companies. And this centres on the investment needed, not just to replace leaking pipes but to support efforts to tackle the climate emergency. Even in Britain, water is becoming a scarce resource. In the torrential storms that have become increasingly prevalent, the water runs off the land, into rivers, rages through town centres and out to sea. Parts of the country need more reservoirs, which means giving over land near cities that might otherwise be farmed, left fallow for wildlife or used for some form of development. Where aquifers are running dry due to overextraction, public bodies need to decide on the priorities, juggling the competing demands of farmers, local businesses and households. Polluted rivers must be cleaned up and that can only come about when there is more pressure on farmers to stop putting so much nitrogen and phosphorous on the land. Treatment plants must be upgraded, as Southern Water will need to do. The World Wildlife Fund found that 40% of rivers in England and Wales were polluted with sewage in 2017, mostly from overflows following heavy rain that existing plants failed to process. Overflows are allowed under the current regime if they are exceptional. The WWF report says that 8%-14% of the 18,000 overflows it examined over a nine-month period spilled sewage into rivers at least once a week, and between a third and a half at least once a month. A separate study by Manchester University found that the river Tame at Denton, to the east of the city, ranked as the worst in the world for microplastics. We know others might be worse, we just haven\u2019t tested them yet. The fund managers who dominate ownership of the UK\u2019s water companies have no interest in collaborating to develop a water system fit for a dry future. And they will say that micro-plastics were not put in the water by them, so why should they pay for the clean-up. Equally, why should public bodies use their precious resources to facilitate an upgrade of the system when profit-hungry investors are one of the main beneficiaries? The government cannot sit still while the finger-pointing and blame-shifting prevent more than slow progress. Why should households and businesses, all of them taxpayers, be asked to save water when the utilities\u2019 managers and international owners do little more than count their bonuses? The same could be said of the energy industry, which must also be at the heart of reforms towards a low carbon future but is largely in private sector hands. D\u0175r Cymru (Welsh Water) is a not-for-profit business that is busily repaying debts from its previous life as a profit generator while also improving the network. It is not the only model for change, but it\u2019s a good start. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July 2019 to clarify that the penalties imposed by Ofwat relate to wastewater treatment, not drinking water, and were not all fines; they comprised \u00a3123m in rebates and a \u00a33m fine.",

There may have been as many as 20,000 self-identified LGBTQ people in the streets of Manhattan on that June day in 1970, which was about 19,990 more than almost anyone had ever seen outside before. If the estimates of organizers about the number of visitors to New York prove correct, two marches scheduled for Sunday in Manhattan will shatter that record by more than four million. If you\u2019re curious about what that first march looked like in 1970, or the names and faces of the earliest activists who got us from there to here, there is no better place to start than Love and Resistance: Out of the Closet Into the Stonewall Era.

      "bodyText": "Long before the Stonewall rebellion, well before anyone ever dared fight for gay liberation or celebrate Pride, an LGBTQ identity could sometimes, just sometimes, act like a remarkable passport. In the 1920s and 30s black Harlemites went to Britain, seeking new experiences, opportunities and lovers. In turn, British queers and lesbians came to Harlem too. After the great war, many in the artistic elite were determined to celebrate simple survival. Through drink, drugs, sex and social provocation, these \u201cbright young people\u201d set out to have a good time. For a while, Harlem seemed at the center of the bohemian world. Sojourning there, some of the bright young things came to see \u201canother arrondissement of Paris\u201d. Few noticed overcrowding and poverty, or appreciated that the parents or grandparents of its residents had often been slaves. Rather, among the British who visited a fashionable notion prevailed: that Negros held an unspoiled vitality. By this mojo alone, some thought, the spent-force of white humanity might be saved from itself. Gay Harlem certainly had vitality. On 22 February 1929, the black journalist Geraldyn Dismond wrote for the Interstate Tatler about the \u201cFaggot\u2019s Ball\u201d, a precursor to today\u2019s ball culture at which crowds always gathered to gawk. \u201cThe greatest joy in life,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis to be able to express one\u2019s inner self. The second greatest joy is to be able to mingle with one\u2019s kind. The third greatest joy is to receive the plaudits of one\u2019s fellows. And thereby hangs the success of the Hamilton Lodge dances which for 61 years have thrilled and entertained the most blas\u00e9 of New York.\u201d Purring over \u201cgowns of all descriptions, jewels, feathers and beauty beyond words\u201d, Dismond singled out \u201cabove and over all, a spirit of abandon, hilarity and camaraderie that fired the imagination and made for a true fiesta\u201d. \u201cOf course, a costume ball can be a very tame thing, but when all the exquisitely gowned women on the floor are men and a number of the smartest men are women, ah then, we have something over which to thrill and grow round-eyed \u2026 Never no wells of loneliness in Harlem\u2026\u201d Small wonder so many artistic Brits arrived. The female impersonator Douglas Byng was acclaimed when he appeared at the Cotton Club in 1930. Lady Louis Mountbatten came, as did the actress Beatrice Lillie, Sir Osbert Sitwell, Stephen Tennant, Lord Peter Churchill, Noel Coward, David Plunket-Green and even Archie Leach, who later became the movie star Cary Grant, his New York \u201croommate\u201d the future Hollywood fashion designer George Kelly, known as \u201cOrry-Kelly\u201d. There was also the artist Edward Burra, ballet dancer Fredrick Ashton, Christopher Isherwood, the speed-boat racing heiress Marion \u201cJoe\u201d Carstairs, and Ivor Novello. All came to Harlem, as if on a soul-stirring pilgrimage. In turn, they met the best of Harlem. In print and on the radio, Dismond was its leading society reporter. Selma Burke was a young sculptor, Harold Jackman, a French teacher acclaimed as the handsomest man in Harlem, was the son of a Jamaican mother and a white Harley Street doctor. Ethel Waters was a well-known singer and actor. Among such souls, friendship across the \u201ccolor-line\u201d became a mark of evolved civility. But one windswept night in 1938, this concept would be put to the test. \u2018He crashed my party\u2026\u2019 It was a smart cocktail party, attended by 50 enlightened souls. But it was gatecrashed and its African American host would bring a half-million dollar libel suit against the gatecrasher himself: the great photographer Cecil Beaton. Beaton was familiar with Harlem, having first visited in 1928. By 1929 he was well-known enough there to be asked to help judge the Odd Fellows\u2019 Masquerade Ball, the festivity described by Dismond, licensed by the police, that allowed men and women to cross-dress legally. A decade later, though, Beaton betrayed Harlem\u2019s esteem. On 11 February 1938, Jay William Clifford and his wife\u2019s cocktail party commenced in a top-floor apartment at the Monterey, a building on a plaza with a bronze statue of Washington and Lafayette, overlooking Morningside Park at 114th Street. The modernistic decor had been devised by a gay African American interior designer, Harold Curtis Brown. Trained at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School and in London and Paris, he designed some of Harlem\u2019s most select clubs and chicest apartments. He supplied the Cotton Club with salacious murals where burley \u201cbucks\u201d pursue seductive \u201cwenches\u201d. At the Cliffords\u2019, he created polychrome, tartan-like wall paintings. Beaton was already under a cloud, fresh from a scandal over minutely drawn antisemitic missives discovered in illustrations for American Vogue. When the book Cecil Beaton\u2019s New York appeared, the following year, it would reveal patronizing thoughts about his night at the Cliffords\u2019. Ridiculing artificial ivy twined round the steam pipes of the foyer, mocking the way the faux marble mantelpiece swayed to the touch, Beaton heaped animus on Brown\u2019s decorative theatricality. Worse, he supposedly quoted racist insults by acquaintances, such as: \u201cI like niggers. I know several and they\u2019re just as nice and cozy...\u201d His initial fascination had given way to scorn. Harlem, he wrote, was \u201ca Negro reservation in a white man\u2019s city\u201d. Clifford\u2019s relative affluence lay in his position as US customs inspector, specializing in discovering smuggled narcotics. Beaton called him \u201ca rich Negro\u201d. Going for the jugular with crass characterizations, he described fellow guests as \u201cenormous black mammas, isolated in their jet and sequins\u201d. Jimmie Daniels was a black gay cabaret singer, the toast of Monte Carlo\u2019s Summer Sporting Club and Ciro\u2019s in London. He was mocked by Beaton as a little man at the piano, reciting \u201cembarrassingly mediocre verse in a tragic voice\u2026\u201d Beaton avoided direct reference to other gay black friends and various whites in attendance. Carl Van Vechten, for example, a red-faced blond with an overbite, eluded the author\u2019s ire. Gay but married to the actress Fania Marinoff, Van Vechten was a critic and writer considered the great white father of Harlem\u2019s cultural renaissance. Through him, promising black poets met the best publishers. Gifted artists were presented to rich collectors. Van Vechten also parlayed his Harlem forays into a novel, provocatively titled Nigger Heaven, derived from the local slang for theater balconies, where even in Harlem black people were mostly made to sit. The name was also a clever analogy for Harlem\u2019s geographic and social situation, connected to and overlooking the rest of Manhattan but from a distant remove. Van Vechten was recognizable in Beaton\u2019s account of the Cliffords\u2019 party, by reference to his daisy embroidered shirt collar and cuffs. But he was not named. Nor were Beaton\u2019s friends from home. On their honeymoon, David Tennant and his wife were accompanied Olivia Wyndham, Tennant\u2019s first cousin. Count and Countess Friedrich von Ledebur were present, the countess the former Iris Tree. Godfrey Reinhardt, son of a famed impresario, was another visitor. His presence did prompt lampoon: \u201cWhy, it\u2019s gettin\u2019 to be more\u2019n more like a League of Nations here. Hey, hey, hey!\u201d The point of Beaton\u2019s send-up seems to have been that fellow guests who were black and their hosts \u2013 whom he called \u201ctree-climbers\u201d and \u201coctoroons\u201d \u2013 were guilty of being affected and pretentious. Never mind that the \u201cmiddle class\u201d Beaton might have been called out for putting on airs himself. Naturally enough, when Beaton\u2019s book was published, Jay William Clifford was furious. \u201cHe crashed my party,\u201d he fumed, \u201c[he] disrespected my wife and guest and affronted Negros generally.\u201d It particularly irked him, he said, that Beaton had written to his wife from the Waldorf Astoria, thanking her \u201cfor a wonderful time\u201d. And so, Clifford sued. \u2018The most responsive lover\u2019 So much for Cecil Beaton. On this Pride weekend, more than 75 years later, other guests at the Cliffords\u2019 famous party are more deserving of remembrance. Jimmie Daniels, said the great modern architect Philip Johnson, was \u201clithe, handsome, fun and charismatic, sexually \u2026 the most responsive lover I ever had.\u201d Beginning in 1934, the pair conducted assignations for two years, most often in a large apartment at 1890 Seventh Avenue, a cooperative unit in which Daniels shared a room with lauded novelist Wallace Thurman and which was owned by distinguished actress Edna Lewis Thomas. Thomas was at the Clifford party too, with her husband Lloyd Thomas and her lover, Olivia Wyndham. Edna Lewis Thomas was immortalized by her interpretation of Lady Macbeth in Orson Wells\u2019 stage debut, in Harlem in 1936. Olivia Wyndham, a photographer-party giver and goer, was a member of one of England\u2019s most distinguished families. She first ventured to Harlem in 1930, as the wife of Howland Spencer. Her new husband made a career of marrying rich women and was also gay. He miscalculated. Although a great-great-granddaughter of the last Earl of Egremont, at least by New York society standards Wyndham was poor. And she too had blundered, imagining Spencer a wealthy \u201cbeard\u201d. As for Daniels and Johnson, they drifted apart. \u201cI was sadder than I\u2019d thought I might be,\u201d Johnson later said, though he admitted that the passionate youth \u201cprobably left me for someone who was better in bed\u201d. Johnson\u2019s inability to protect his black boyfriend from the indignity of fancy restaurants failing to provide service on account of his color, or his admitted failure to always include him at parties and on trips, seem more logical reasons for their break-up. Daniels\u2019 next partner was married to a very rich and encouraging lesbian, the acclaimed poet \u201cBryher\u201d, aka Winifred Ellerman. Kenneth Macpherson was a more caring lover. At the Clifford shindig, the Scottish writer was by his boyfriend\u2019s side. Georgette Harvey, a singer with a deep melodious voice, was there too. She came with her lover, the singer Musa Williams. Harvey, who originated the role of Maria in Porgy and Bess, had returned to Harlem after starring in St Petersburg for 16 years, a charmed existence cut short by revolution. She reflected wistfully: \u201cAt the peak of my career I had a large town house, jewels, sables, social position and immense popularity with the livelier members of Czar Nicholas\u2019 court. Among my lovers was one of the most famous of the Russian courtesans. \u201cIn the revolution I lost everything, including seventy-five thousand dollars\u2026Homosexuality is a lonely life\u2026\u201d Were these denizens of Harlem really so different? Were they less accomplished, more boorish and boasting than Beaton and his kind? One suspects not. Years later, in 1950, Our World magazine retraced Beaton\u2019s steps in New York, setting out to see what the black beau monde was really like. Its conclusion? \u201cBeaton lied!\u201d",

The UK has more offshore wind capacity than anywhere in the world, with 37 projects made up of nearly 2,000 turbines. There is nearly 8GW of capacity today, 1.3GW of which was added in 2018. Another 5GW is already committed to. The UK has 44% of all European offshore wind power capacity.</p>\n    <p><b>What obstacles has wind power faced?<br></b>The first subsidies awarded to offshore windfarms promised developers a guaranteed price of up to \u00a3150 per megawatt hour, or roughly three times the wholesale cost of electricity. Such steep subsidies would not be sustainable but cost reductions in the industry have seen that figure drop to as low as \u00a357.50. The offshore wind industry has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/29/wind-turbines-uk-firms-miss-out\">criticised for not using enough UK contractors and suppliers</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>What is the economic benefit to the UK?<br></b>The industry employs around 11,000 people. One of the side effects of offshore wind\u2019s growth has been an injection of money and jobs into coastal towns that in some cases have big pockets of economic deprivation. Ports have been upgraded and new maintenance facilities built, such as the one at Newhaven in East Sussex for the first windfarm in the English Channel. The different parts of turbines are made across the UK, from the Isle of Wight to Hull.</p>\n    <p><b>What does the future hold for offshore wind power in the UK?<br></b>The industry has a target of growing today\u2019s 8GW capacity to 30GW by 2030, which, if achieved, would see offshore wind power supplying more than a third of the UK\u2019s electricity. The government has put a \u00a3557m pot of funding aside for subsidies for renewables in the next few years, most of which is expected to be taken up by offshore windfarms. The industry is also hoping for export opportunities for UK firms, as new markets grow in the US and Asia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Simon Clarke, another MP backing Johnson, said: \u201cAs we are going for net zero, then we need to completely decarbonise our electrical grid, and onshore wind is the cheapest way to do this.

This has led to the 8pm curfew being extended to 10pm across large swaths of the country. And while there are still reports of clan fighting in the western Highlands this is slowly being eradicated thanks to the sturdy intervention of the Royal Dragoons and a crackdown on illicit whisky stills. In places such as Cumbernauld and Thurso, where the druids are holding out, colleges are offering degrees in face-painting and plaid-stitching. Human sacrifices are now confined solely to the remote communities of South Lanarkshire.</p> <p>Sheep and goats remain staples of the rural economy but some places are becoming tourist destinations with visitors enchanted by the possibility of seeing wolves and bears in their natural habitat. In the civilised central belt, limited internet connectivity has been introduced and you don\u2019t see as many kilts being worn at home or in the office.</p> <p>The mortality rate in inner cities has been reduced and life expectancy has reached 37 in some affluent neighbourhoods. Young Scots have forsaken the beer and whisky of an older generation and are embracing sophisticated cocktails such as Bacardi Breezers and MD 20/20.

Vine was obviously delighted to have Burrell bring some perspective and clarity to this emotional and divisive issue. Here are some excerpts. Burrell: \u201cI think the UK is stronger together than they are apart. I mean for goodness sakes, Scotland by itself\u2026 how is it going to survive? It has\u2026 what does it have? Oil, and a monster in a lake. Cheryl from Cheam: \u201cWhisky, wind power?\u201d Annabel from Arundel: \u201cIrn-Bru.\u201d Burrell: \u201cBut getting back to the Queen: the Queen loves Scotland. Her favourite home is in Scotland, Balmoral. She would not want that to be detached from the UK.\u201d Vine: \u201cHow would they take it out? Remove Balmoral?\u201d Burrell: \u201cWhat would our flag look like?\u201d Vine: \u201cWell, I think she would still be in Scotland. It would be like Canada, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Burrell: \u201cShe would go overseas for her holidays.\u201d In those moments, it became clear to us all that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa would have their work cut out trying to make a comeback on daytime political television. In Scotland, the response to this discussion was wearily predictable and, as usual, entirely without self-awareness. The perpetual grievance monkeys in the SNP expressed outrage that no one had mentioned the vibrant Buckfast Tonic Wine market and the Krispy Kreme doughnut and Domino\u2019s Pizza franchises that are taking our economy in new directions. We shouldn\u2019t whinge about the show\u2019s brave attempts to understand the subtle nuances that exist in Scotland\u2019s civic landscape. Instead, we should focus on the positives and rejoice that there is still a sense of solidarity with the challenges we face. Burrell has been a model ambassador for the royal family and it\u2019s gratifying to think that he might put in a good word for us when he next sits down with the Queen. Scotland has undergone something of a cultural renaissance in recent years and Vine\u2019s producers need to think seriously about a location piece direct from the streets of Glasgow or the shores of Loch Ness. Vine himself would be the ideal host, with an assortment of English cultural figures accompanying him such as Basil Brush, Jim Davidson and James Corden. They would find that the march of progress north of the border has been rather splendid. An ambitious programme of street lighting is being rolled out across Scotland\u2019s towns and cities. This has led to the 8pm curfew being extended to 10pm across large swaths of the country. And while there are still reports of clan fighting in the western Highlands this is slowly being eradicated thanks to the sturdy intervention of the Royal Dragoons and a crackdown on illicit whisky stills. In places such as Cumbernauld and Thurso, where the druids are holding out, colleges are offering degrees in face-painting and plaid-stitching. Human sacrifices are now confined solely to the remote communities of South Lanarkshire. Sheep and goats remain staples of the rural economy but some places are becoming tourist destinations with visitors enchanted by the possibility of seeing wolves and bears in their natural habitat. In the civilised central belt, limited internet connectivity has been introduced and you don\u2019t see as many kilts being worn at home or in the office. The mortality rate in inner cities has been reduced and life expectancy has reached 37 in some affluent neighbourhoods. Young Scots have forsaken the beer and whisky of an older generation and are embracing sophisticated cocktails such as Bacardi Breezers and MD 20/20. It\u2019s only a matter of time before David Attenborough and Simon Schama show up to provide some natural and philosophical context to these great tectonic shifts. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

But at the rate they are consolidating power \u2013 over the courts, politics and the media \u2013 this could be the opposition\u2019s last chance. What would it do? Would it allow virtually anyone to seek to be the party\u2019s candidate for president (and gain valuable brand recognition along the way), including spiritual gurus, one-issue entrepreneurs and minor elected officials who have never even run for state office? I doubt it. The party would establish criteria to filter out those who had no real chance. Would it let almost every one of them go on television to debate one other, thereby placing a premium on one-line zingers, fast talk and rapid-fire putdowns? Would it assign them randomly to one of two nights, so several candidates with the most support would not even get to debate one other? Of course not. Instead, it would take the half-dozen who had the best chance and structure the debates so they could demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the forcefulness of their ideas in lengthy back-and-forth exchanges. Would it encourage them to split the party over policy issues that almost no one understands, such as the meaning of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d, thereby causing some voters to become alarmed about a government takeover of the healthcare system and others to worry the government won\u2019t go far enough? No. It would encourage the candidates to emphasize the larger goal, in this case to provide health insurance to everyone, and have them explain that a so-called \u201cpublic option\u201d to buy into Medicare would eventually displace for-profit private insurers anyway, because it would be so much cheaper. Would it let any of this deflect attention from the tyrant keeping children in cages at the border, coddling foreign dictators and inviting them to help him in the next election, shattering alliances with other democracies, using his office to make money for himself and his family, lying non-stop, subsidizing fossil fuels and downplaying climate change, claiming the media is guilty of treason, and undermining other democratic institutions and norms? Of course not. Although it would want its candidates to float some ambitious and sensible proposals that would get people hopeful about the future, it would also want them to keep attention on what the tyrant was doing and the dangers he posed. Finally, given the extraordinarily high stakes in the upcoming election, would it decide on its candidate in much the same way it has done in the recent past \u2013 solely on the basis of who can attract the most primary voters and caucus attenders? No. It would have its eye on the general election. It would be thinking strategically about how to attract voters in places the tyrant won in the last election but could swing back. In America, that would be Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina. This doesn\u2019t mean it would support a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201ccentrist\u201d candidate. These terms mean little in a land succumbing to tyranny and oligarchy. It would do best with a candidate able to create a multiracial coalition to fight the tyrant and his oligarchy \u2013 a coalition combining poor, working class and middle class whites, blacks and Latinos. It would need a candidate who could explain how the tyrant uses racism and xenophobia to divide and conquer, turning the majority against each other. A candidate who could help people understand that a necessary part of fighting tyranny is fighting racism, and a requisite for fighting inequality is reversing climate change. A candidate who could unite the country around an agenda of robust democracy and shared prosperity. This may sound fanciful but the challenge is real and the Democratic party must meet it over the next 17 months. What may be fanciful is that today\u2019s Democratic party has the power to select its candidate in the ways I\u2019ve suggested. Yet the stakes in the 2020 election are larger than any election in living memory. The Democrats\u2019 selection of a candidate therefore is no ordinary thing. In a very real sense, the fates of America and the world depend on it. The question is whether the Democratic party is up to the task.

      "body": "<p>Vladimir Putin has many faces: Russian patriot, man of the people, macho sportsman, global power-broker. But the mask slipped last week. The world glimpsed the real Putin and it was an ugly sight. There is a meanness about him, a smallness of mind born of fear and anger. His world view, warped by the cold war and his KGB training, is twisted, resentful, defensive. He has almost nothing positive to say. Putin is an empty space where leadership and moral example should be.</p> <p>Why, then, should anybody care what he thinks? His remarks proclaiming western liberalism \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/27/putin-skripal-attack-should-not-affect-uk-russia-relations\" title=\"\">obsolete</a>\u201d were deliberately provocative. His inflammatory comments about immigration and multiculturalism, his ill-disguised homophobia and his chilling vow to punish \u201ctraitors\u201d (a reference to last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/28/theresa-may-exchanges-cool-handshake-with-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Salisbury poisonings</a> by Russian agents) were familiar tactics, intended to sow division and unease. Why rise to such obvious incitements? Surely it would be better to ignore him? Western leaders find that impossible in part because they fear Putin may be right. Certainly not on matters of principle, nor in terms of his nasty prejudices. But when he suggests reactionary nationalist and populist forces are everywhere advancing, that the postwar democratic consensus no longer holds and that \u201cthe liberal idea [is in] conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population\u201d, they worry there could be a grain of truth. This is the truly menacing, subversive face of Putinism. And it is infecting the global body politic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s an eat-or-be-eaten world in which cold-eyed men like Putin and Trump are predators-in-chief</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Putinism has an ally in Donald Trump, who greeted Russia\u2019s president as an honoured friend at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/27/the-guardian-view-of-the-osaka-g20-summit-bad-as-he-is-trump-is-not-the-only-problem\" title=\"\">Osaka G20 summit</a>. The two men share a liking for authoritarian governance by executive decree, intolerance for democratic, legal and parliamentary constraints and a crude vision of a world divided by nations, money and brute force.</p> <p>Putin praised Trump\u2019s mistreatment of migrants who, he said, \u201ckill, plunder and rape with impunity\u201d. A smirking Trump joked about Putin\u2019s illicit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/28/smirking-trump-jokes-to-putin-dont-meddle-in-us-election-g20\" title=\"\">election meddling</a> (which helped him win in 2016) and what fun it would be to \u201cget rid\u201d of journalists. In fact, Putin has pursued the latter idea with lethal efficiency for 20 years.</p> <p>In places such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Brazil, the Philippines, Sudan and Egypt, Putinism is catching on. Basically, \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders centralise power, buy off, lock up or eliminate opponents, silence the media, lie to the public and then do whatever they want.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>\u2019s China has its own variation on the theme. Europe\u2019s emulators include Hungary\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-orban\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>. The central, fear-inducing message of such leaders is that the people and the nation are under threat from multiple outside forces and only they will protect them.</p> <p>This is the dystopia evoked by Putin\u2019s bragging. This is the alternative, nightmare world he represents, where democratic consent no longer matters, where individual rights are scorned, where gender and racial differences are penalised, where courts and judges are no longer impartial, where newspapers print what they are ordered, where tolerance and compassion are seen as weaknesses and where international law, regulating relations between states, is ignored. It\u2019s an eat-or-be-eaten world in which cold-eyed men such as Putin and Trump are predators-in-chief.</p> <p>The threat from the right is plain. But those on the left who act as apologists for Putin\u2019s Russia should take a long, hard look at themselves. Collaboration with the many faces of modern fascism is as repulsive as ever. Democracy\u2019s weaknesses, and the imperfections of institutions such as the EU, do not remotely justify their destruction and vilification.</p> <p>Know your enemy: that is the lesson of 1930s Europe and it is urgently applicable today. Essential, vibrant liberal values and beliefs are worth fighting for now, just as much as during the great struggles of the 20th century. The proud legacy of a consensual, rules-based world order is ours to defend, develop and project, not heedlessly squander or tamely surrender to the demagogues of the new nationalist-populist miasma. As the EU council president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/donald-tusk\" title=\"\">Donald Tusk</a>, says, what is really <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/28/ideology-debate-putin-says-liberalism-obsolete-tusk-says-authoritarianism-obsolete\" title=\"\">obsolete</a> is \u201cauthoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs\u201d.</p> <p>And that, surely, is the point. The anxious introspection triggered by Putin should not obstruct a clear-eyed view of the Russia he has built.

      "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has many faces: Russian patriot, man of the people, macho sportsman, global power-broker. But the mask slipped last week. The world glimpsed the real Putin and it was an ugly sight. There is a meanness about him, a smallness of mind born of fear and anger. His world view, warped by the cold war and his KGB training, is twisted, resentful, defensive. He has almost nothing positive to say. Putin is an empty space where leadership and moral example should be. Why, then, should anybody care what he thinks? His remarks proclaiming western liberalism \u201cobsolete\u201d were deliberately provocative. His inflammatory comments about immigration and multiculturalism, his ill-disguised homophobia and his chilling vow to punish \u201ctraitors\u201d (a reference to last year\u2019s Salisbury poisonings by Russian agents) were familiar tactics, intended to sow division and unease. Why rise to such obvious incitements? Surely it would be better to ignore him? Western leaders find that impossible in part because they fear Putin may be right. Certainly not on matters of principle, nor in terms of his nasty prejudices. But when he suggests reactionary nationalist and populist forces are everywhere advancing, that the postwar democratic consensus no longer holds and that \u201cthe liberal idea [is in] conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population\u201d, they worry there could be a grain of truth. This is the truly menacing, subversive face of Putinism. And it is infecting the global body politic. Putinism has an ally in Donald Trump, who greeted Russia\u2019s president as an honoured friend at this weekend\u2019s Osaka G20 summit. The two men share a liking for authoritarian governance by executive decree, intolerance for democratic, legal and parliamentary constraints and a crude vision of a world divided by nations, money and brute force. Putin praised Trump\u2019s mistreatment of migrants who, he said, \u201ckill, plunder and rape with impunity\u201d. A smirking Trump joked about Putin\u2019s illicit election meddling (which helped him win in 2016) and what fun it would be to \u201cget rid\u201d of journalists. In fact, Putin has pursued the latter idea with lethal efficiency for 20 years. In places such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Brazil, the Philippines, Sudan and Egypt, Putinism is catching on. Basically, \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders centralise power, buy off, lock up or eliminate opponents, silence the media, lie to the public and then do whatever they want. Xi Jinping\u2019s China has its own variation on the theme. Europe\u2019s emulators include Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The central, fear-inducing message of such leaders is that the people and the nation are under threat from multiple outside forces and only they will protect them. This is the dystopia evoked by Putin\u2019s bragging. This is the alternative, nightmare world he represents, where democratic consent no longer matters, where individual rights are scorned, where gender and racial differences are penalised, where courts and judges are no longer impartial, where newspapers print what they are ordered, where tolerance and compassion are seen as weaknesses and where international law, regulating relations between states, is ignored. It\u2019s an eat-or-be-eaten world in which cold-eyed men such as Putin and Trump are predators-in-chief. The threat from the right is plain. But those on the left who act as apologists for Putin\u2019s Russia should take a long, hard look at themselves. Collaboration with the many faces of modern fascism is as repulsive as ever. Democracy\u2019s weaknesses, and the imperfections of institutions such as the EU, do not remotely justify their destruction and vilification. Know your enemy: that is the lesson of 1930s Europe and it is urgently applicable today. Essential, vibrant liberal values and beliefs are worth fighting for now, just as much as during the great struggles of the 20th century. The proud legacy of a consensual, rules-based world order is ours to defend, develop and project, not heedlessly squander or tamely surrender to the demagogues of the new nationalist-populist miasma. As the EU council president, Donald Tusk, says, what is really obsolete is \u201cauthoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs\u201d. And that, surely, is the point. The anxious introspection triggered by Putin should not obstruct a clear-eyed view of the Russia he has built. Putin rose to power in 1999-2000 on the back of an atrocious conflict in the Caucasus and has been waging unjust wars, in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria, ever since. Under Putin\u2019s rule, Russia suffers de facto one-party rule, systemic corruption, repression of civil rights, censorship and mafia-style assassinations that routinely go unpunished. The idea that Putinism offers a viable, alternative governance model is as ridiculous as it is sickening. Who massacred the citizens of Grozny and Aleppo and is still killing innocents in Idlib today? Who killed Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko? Who killed Boris Nemtsov? Who killed 298 people aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine? And who tried to kill the Skripals? Vladimir Putin is definitely among the world\u2019s most wanted men \u2013 but not for the reasons he thinks.",

Though really, I order it because it\u2019s the second cheapest on the geographically restless list \u2013 which, at \u00a332, isn\u2019t cheap at all. You\u2019ve got the message. Beyond the door in the gallery, awaiting purchase, is some of the world\u2019s greatest art, and in this dining room is some of London\u2019s best Italian food. This being Bonhams, and this being Bond Street and this being 2019, it all costs. It doesn\u2019t stop Hockney\u2019s lilies being divine or Andrew\u2019s pasta being worthy of a love letter. Just be prepared to gawp at some big numbers come the bill.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Talking of unexpected places in which to find cracking Italian food, Festa Sul Prato is a caf\u00e9 located in the reconditioned toilet block of a park in Deptford, south London. As well as a through-the-day offering including chunky sourdough sandwiches \u2013 salami, gorgonzola and rocket for example, or cream cheese and smoked salmon \u2013 for a fiver, there\u2019s a bigger lunch and dinner menu. There\u2019s a changing list of pastas, alongside mains such as roasted asparagus or fennel sausages with rosemary potatoes. A full meal here could easily cost less than a starter at Emilia (<a href=\"http://festasulprato.com/\">festasulprato.com</a>).</p> <p>Smack Lobster, a casual spin-off from the Burger and Lobster chain, offering a range of lobster rolls in brioche buns, has transitioned to the cloud. It has closed its bricks-and-mortar outpost on Dean Street in London\u2019s Soho, but the menu is still available across central London through Deliveroo. There are plans to roll it out across the capital.</p> <p>Chef-restaurateur Nico Simeone is bringing his ever-changing tasting menu brand to England for the first time.

We drink a bottle of something crisp from Crete, because I\u2019m going there this summer and need to get the training in. Though really, I order it because it\u2019s the second cheapest on the geographically restless list \u2013 which, at \u00a332, isn\u2019t cheap at all. You\u2019ve got the message. Beyond the door in the gallery, awaiting purchase, is some of the world\u2019s greatest art, and in this dining room is some of London\u2019s best Italian food. This being Bonhams, and this being Bond Street and this being 2019, it all costs. It doesn\u2019t stop Hockney\u2019s lilies being divine or Andrew\u2019s pasta being worthy of a love letter. Just be prepared to gawp at some big numbers come the bill. News bites Talking of unexpected places in which to find cracking Italian food, Festa Sul Prato is a caf\u00e9 located in the reconditioned toilet block of a park in Deptford, south London. As well as a through-the-day offering including chunky sourdough sandwiches \u2013 salami, gorgonzola and rocket for example, or cream cheese and smoked salmon \u2013 for a fiver, there\u2019s a bigger lunch and dinner menu. There\u2019s a changing list of pastas, alongside mains such as roasted asparagus or fennel sausages with rosemary potatoes. A full meal here could easily cost less than a starter at Emilia (festasulprato.com). Smack Lobster, a casual spin-off from the Burger and Lobster chain, offering a range of lobster rolls in brioche buns, has transitioned to the cloud. It has closed its bricks-and-mortar outpost on Dean Street in London\u2019s Soho, but the menu is still available across central London through Deliveroo. There are plans to roll it out across the capital. Chef-restaurateur Nico Simeone is bringing his ever-changing tasting menu brand to England for the first time. Six by Nico, already established in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast, will open in Manchester in July (sixbynico.co.uk). Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

The British charity Edinburgh Direct Aid (EDA) as well as the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) are on the ground helping to construct and move families into new wood and tarpaulin shelters, but time is running out before the Monday deadline and the evictions have stretched aid groups\u2019 financial resources. \u201cI cried when we got the order to demolish our home,\u201d said a 47-year-old father of five, Mohamed al-Qasem, who lost his leg after a shelling attack in Syria. \u201cThe breeze-block walls protect us from the worst of the winter storms. I couldn\u2019t do the work with one leg but I had no choice, even if it took me six months on crutches. Now we can relax \u2013 our home is finished and we have obeyed the army rules. But what about the next time they order us to do something? We never know.\u201d Lebanon has become home to about 1.5 million Syrians since the war next door broke out in 2011. Fearing the newcomers would permanently settle \u2013 like the Palestinians before them \u2013 the Lebanese government has not allowed the creation of formal refugee camps and outlawed the construction of \u201cpermanent residences\u201d using concrete. The ordered demolition in Arsal has left 5,000 families and as many as 15,000 children homeless again, according to Save the Children, forced to relive the traumatic experience of sleeping outside or in overcrowded tents. Anti-refugee sentiment has grown and faded in Lebanon over the years, but is on the rise again as a result of a deteriorating economy and the growing profile of the foreign minister, Gebran Bassil, who has spearheaded a new campaign to send Syrians home. Bassil, the leader of Lebanon\u2019s largest Christian party, the Free Patriotic Movement, portrays himself as the protector of the country\u2019s dwindling Christian population by referring to what he says is a Lebanese \u201cgenetic distinction\u201d and nationalist slogans such as \u201cLebanon above all\u201d. It is believed he has ambitions to take over as president from his ageing father-in-law, Michel Aoun. His government coalition allies have begun enforcing laws that were previously rarely implemented, shutting down shops owned by or employing Syrians without permits and ordering the demolition of permanent refugee structures. The hostile rhetoric has spiralled into violent incidents, such as an arson attack on a Syrian settlement near the town of Deir al-Qamar this month which displaced 400 people. After eight years of exile in miserable conditions, many Syrians express a desire to return home. Aid agencies and rights groups say, however, that without a political resolution to the war or guarantees for returners\u2019 safety the country is still too dangerous for any large-scale return programme. \u201cWhile many parts of Syria are not witnessing active conflict any more, vast swaths of the country are still facing unprecedented destruction. This means that many refugees do not have homes to return to or services when they get there,\u201d said Joelle Bassoul, regional media manager for Save the Children. \u201cIn addition, men fear conscription into the Syrian armed forces, and many families are concerned about arrest, detention, and imprisonment if they return.\u201d In Arsal on Friday, a visit from the army to inspect the demolition work sent tensions in the camp skyrocketing. \u201cWe battle on and we will meet the deadline but the future for Syrian refugees in Lebanon is bleak,\u201d Maggie Tookey, overseas project director for EDA, said from the site. \u201cI saw the hopelessness in the eyes of Fatima Zahouri, a young teacher. She asked me: \u2018Is this the way our lives will always be?\u2019\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says Australian authorities are still attempting to establish what happened to Perth student Alek Sigley, who disappeared in North Korea several days ago. Morrison told reporters at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on Saturday evening that he had been in contact with Sigley\u2019s family. He said world leaders at the summit had offered their assistance in attempts to locate the young man. \u201cI will just be measured in what I say because that is all about using the best opportunities we have right now to, to inform ourselves about where Alek is and what his safety is and where he is being held, in what conditions,\u201d he told reporters on Saturday evening. Sigley, one of only a handful of western students in the secretive country, last made contact with his Australian family on Tuesday. His Facebook page, which had been taken down to prevent unnecessary speculation online, briefly reappeared on Saturday. Sigley\u2019s Twitter account has remained online and members of the public have posted messages of support there. The 29-year-old Australian moved to North Korea to study for a master\u2019s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang, and also ran a small tour company specialising in educational trips to North Korea. He posted regularly, on a private blog and on social media accounts, about food, fashion and every day life in the secretive state. Guardian Australia published a first-person account by Sigley in March. Experts have suggested Sigley might have been silenced in the lead-up to US president Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the demilitarised zone (DMZ). When asked if Trump\u2019s visit to the Korean DMZ presented an opportunity for the Americans to make representations, Morrison said he would not allow the issue to be taken up with other agendas. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with everybody to secure Alek\u2019s safety and the best way we can do that is doing it quietly, effectively, working with our partners \u2026 not allowing this to be taken up into other agendas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s simply, for me, about Alek\u2019s safety. Sorry.\u201d The treatment of foreign citizens by the secretive North has long been a contentious issue. American student Otto Warmbier died in 2017 after being detained in North Korea for stealing a propaganda poster from his hotel room.",
