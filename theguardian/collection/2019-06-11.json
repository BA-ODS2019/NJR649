      "bodyText": "Universities should hire specialist staff to investigate hate crimes and sexual harassment against their students, according to a report commissioned by the higher education regulator for England. The institutions were also urged to encourage greater levels of reporting of such incidents, and hold sessions on consent for undergraduates and postgraduates, along with \u201cbystander training\u201d for students and staff to encourage prevention. The report by Advance HE evaluated more than 100 pilot schemes funded by the Office for Students (OfS) and designed to tackle hate-crime incidents and sexual violence and harassment at 84 universities and colleges, which concluded universities needed to do much more in terms of staffing, leadership and resources to safeguard students. Alison Johns, Advance HE\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThere is a clear need for continued senior leadership and governance to protect students and tackle this unacceptable antisocial behaviour both within higher education institutions and the sector as a whole.\u201d The evaluation called on institutions to be more active in helping students feel safe on campus. Many universities and colleges do little to collect or analyse reports of incidents outside the pilot schemes, while black and minority ethnic students were less confident than white students in using complaints procedures. In response, the OfS said \u201cpractices to tackle and prevent hate crime, sexual harassment and online harassment need to be fully embedded into the day-to-day running\u201d of England\u2019s colleges and universities. The report concluded governing bodies needed to hold vice-chancellors and senior executives to account over the prevalence of incidents, and called on the national body representing university chairs and chancellors to adopt a framework for tackling hate crimes as well as sexual misconduct. In several examples, the report found students\u2019 willingness to disclose sexual misconduct \u2013 ranging from rape and sexual assault to cyberstalking \u2013 increased as a result of awareness campaigns on campus as well as the provision of support. \u201cIt is especially important for higher education providers to plan for the rise in reporting levels to ensure that support and investigations may be put in place,\u201d the report concluded, adding that one full-time staff member for every 10,000 students was a \u201cbasic requirement\u201d. Many universities in England have no dedicated staff to investigate hate crimes or sexual misconduct, despite recent evidence that a substantial proportion of students experience attacks or harassment. Yvonne Hawkins, the director of student experience at the OfS, said: \u201cStudents should be able to concentrate on their studies and enjoy their higher education experience free from the fear of harassment or assault. \u201cShocking statistics show that, while many students have a positive experience of higher education, others are experiencing incidents of harassment or assault. This is simply unacceptable.\u201d The report also called for a cultural change in universities\u2019 approach to investigations, away from \u201ccriminal justice levels of evidence\u201d that require charges to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and towards a \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d similar to that used in civil courts.",

The chair of the committee, Tom Tugendhat, said: \u201cThe division of the UK abroad has hampered its efforts to achieve its strategic aims. A lot of UK action abroad has been stove-piped into different departments and, as the Foreign Office as an institution has lost authority, what we have lost is the strategic coordination that would have brought together a realisation that political risk in one country, for instance, can bring about financial risk in the UK.\u201d A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cIt is simply not true that our approach on sanctions risks national security. We have led the way in the EU on sanctions \u2013 securing agreement on new regimes to target chemical weapons use and cyber-attacks in the last year alone \u2013 and we will continue to be a world leader after Brexit.\u201d",

The National Audit Office (NAO) said the Food Standards Agency must bring in new laws on imported products after leaving the EU. This may not be possible in the near term owing to delays in the parliamentary programme, it said. About half of the food consumed in the UK is produced in the EU and other countries. The FSA spent \u00a36.2m of its budget on EU exit preparations across 2017/18 and 2018/19 and received \u00a315m of additional EU exit funding. The NAO said it had not seen any evidence of joined-up strategic thinking within government about the level of funding needed for a sustainable system to protect UK consumers from future food risks, or about how much local authorities and businesses should contribute.

      "bodyText": "A growing number of Britons claim they are actively avoiding the news out of frustration at coverage of Brexit, research has found, even as news websites report record numbers of visitors wanting to read about major developments. The discrepancy suggests that while many people publicly insist they are avoiding news about the UK\u2019s ongoing political crisis, some may be unable to stop themselves secretly gorging on updates about Britain leaving the EU. YouGov polling commissioned by the University of Oxford\u2019s Reuters Institute found that a substantial 35% of Britons now insist they actively attempt to avoid the news \u201cdue to frustration over the intractable and polarising nature\u201d of the Brexit debate. Most cited the negative impact the news has on their mood, along with other concerns such as a sense of exasperation that there is nothing that individuals can do to influence the country\u2019s ongoing political crisis. Remain voters were particularly likely to say their emotions were being negatively affected by news stories, according to the institute\u2019s annual report on the state of the digital news industry. However, individuals at four major national British news websites said they had seen record numbers of visitors to their outlets during major developments in the Brexit process \u2013 suggesting the British public may be lying to themselves, at least when it comes to reading about key political developments. One executive at a major national news website said, while some people may be actively staying away, they had seen enormous interest as a result of Brexit news stories. Another said they were finding that strong performance by news stories about Brexit was masking declines elsewhere on their site. According to one BBC insider, the BBC News website attracted 28 million unique visitors in January on the day of parliament\u2019s first meaningful vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit day, while 25 million checked the website the following day when it was covering the no-confidence vote in the prime minister. Alleged Brexit fatigue among the British public has also been used by some news programmes to justify declining audiences. Channel 4 said on Tuesday that the exasperation with the process was partly responsible for a fall in the number of people watching its news programme, while BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme has also previously attributed fluctuating listening figures to exasperation with the process. The Reuters Institute report, which covers 38 different regions around the world, found that the social media habits of consumers in many countries are changing.

Researchers found that male finches that picked up the fly parasite had malformed beaks and enlarged nostrils that led to \u201csubpar songs\u201d, making it harder for the birds to find mates and reproduce. The infection is caused by the Philornis downsi fly, which is thought to have been introduced to the islands by accident in the 1960s. The fly\u2019s larvae infest birds\u2019 nests and feed on the blood and tissues of their young. Surveys on the Gal\u00e1pagos islands show that the larvae are now rife and kill more than half of all nestling finches. Those that survive can have badly damaged nasal cavities and nostrils, and their beaks can be deformed to the point that they no longer close properly. In new research, Sonia Kleindorfer at Flinders University in Adelaide and colleagues examined the impact of the parasitic infections on what are commonly known as Darwin\u2019s finches. Observations, measurements and sound recordings of the birds revealed that those with deformed nostrils had more \u201cvocal deviation\u201d when they sang to attract mates and produced lower notes than unaffected birds. The result was off-putting to females, and out-of-tune males struggled to find mates.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector is much larger than official figures suggest, according to a report for the government that underscores the broad impact on the economy of high tariff barriers with the EU. The report argues that official statistics, which estimate that manufacturing output accounts for 9% of national income, are based on \u201coutdated and inaccurate methods of counting\u201d and the figure is much higher. Carried out by Cambridge University for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the report shows how a larger slice of UK exports than previously understood are vulnerable to EU tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The report avoids putting a fresh figure on the proportion of GDP accounted for by the sector but one of its authors said it was nearer 15%, once activities tied to the sale of UK-made products, including engineering support and contracted services, were included. \u201cIt is essential that policymakers have accurate information on the size of manufacturing sectors in order to develop an internationally competitive industrial strategy,\u201d said Eoin O\u2019Sullivan, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cIn particular, policymakers need to be able to measure manufacturing in a way that better reflects how firms actually organise themselves into value networks.\u201d Manufacturing industries have declined as a proportion of overall activity in most developed countries, but has fallen more sharply in the UK than many of its rivals.

A steep decline in car production over the last year related to Brexit uncertainty and an escalation of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China have pushed the manufacturing sector into recession. In April the UK economy shrank by 0.4% largely in response to a sharp decline in manufacturing output. Ministers are expected to use the report as a more up-to-date guide to inform the government\u2019s industrial strategy.

Seamus Nevin, the chief economist of the trade body for manufacturers, Make UK, said: \u201cThis report is a clarion call for politicians of all parties to update their understanding and recognise the central importance of manufacturing not only to local regions but to the wider UK economy as well. \u201cAn increasingly outdated understanding of what modern manufacturing actually is means policymakers have neglected the sector in the misguided belief that services, not manufacturing, is where the future potential for innovation and productivity growth lies.\u201d Jostein Hauge, a co-author of the report, said a study last year for the Manufacturing Technologies Association estimated that manufacturing accounted for 23% of GDP, including a wider array of spin-off services that were only tenuously connected to the sector. \u201cWe haven\u2019t put a figure on the size of the manufacturing sector in our report but it is closer to 15%, which is still much larger than the current official figure,\u201d he said.",

According to work from the University of Canberra in cooperation with the Reuters Institute and the University of Oxford, a majority of online consumers in Australia, 62%, are concerned about what is real and what is fake on the internet. This level of local concern is higher than the global average and, the more interested in politics you are, the more you worry about fake news. Because people are becoming aware that the internet is both a cornucopia of information, and a platform for misinformation, the new research suggests a proportion of news consumers in Australia are taking steps to try and verify what they are reading.

It is obviously not a new phenomenon that elections are decided by people with light engagement in politics, or that lies get told and promulgated during elections by political actors and associated entities, or that people sometimes cast their votes based on an entirely false premise. That\u2019s all ever thus. But the digital environment creates challenges that we\u2019ve seen during the 2016 presidential contest in the United States, the Brexit conversation in the United Kingdom, and with the entirely false claims that Labor would introduce a 40% death tax circulated during the recent federal election. There are no simple solutions to these challenges, but if we allow policy makers to steadfastly ignore a problem which is now clearly before us on the basis that there are no easy answers to it, then our shared outlook is clear.

      "bodyText": "The House of Representatives has passed a resolution enabling lawmakers to go to court to enforce their subpoenas against the US attorney general, William Barr, and former White House counsel Don McGahn. The Trump administration has rebuffed Democrats\u2019 attempts to dive more deeply into the Trump-Russia investigation in the aftermath of Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the issue. House Democrats passed the resolution on a party-line vote of 229-191 on Tuesday. The vote had long been planned amid unprecedented efforts by Trump\u2019s administration to stonewall Democrats\u2019 witness and document requests pertaining to special counsel Mueller\u2019s work. Democrats on the House judiciary committee voted last month to hold Barr in contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with a subpoena for the full, un-redacted Mueller report, after a restricted version was made public in April. McGahn separately heeded instructions from the White House to refuse a subpoena calling upon him to testify before Congress. Despite a deal between the committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, and the justice department on Monday, paving the way for his panel to access some of Mueller\u2019s underlying evidence, House Democrats said they were proceeding with Tuesday\u2019s full floor vote to keep the option to enforce their subpoenas in court if necessary. The measure also includes language to enable committee chairmen to enforce their subpoenas in court without a full vote on the House floor. Nadler said on Tuesday afternoon that his panel would move as quickly as possible to go to court to force McGahn to comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena. Speaking after the passage of a House vote to give lawmakers clear authority to sue the Trump administration to force officials to comply with subpoenas, Nadler said, \u201cWe will move forward with holding this president accountable. We will move as quickly as possible to go to court against Don McGahn, the president\u2019s former counsel, and any subsequent witnesses who disobey a committee subpoena.\u201d. Mueller found no criminal conspiracy between Trump and the Russian government during the 2016 election, despite finding that the Russians interfered in the election with efforts to assist Trump. But Mueller did not clear the president of obstruction of justice, leaving Congress to take action to investigate further and decide on possible impeachment. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Democrats \u201cneed answers on the questions left unanswered\u201d by Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia report. Democrats pulled back from threats to hold a vote on criminal contempt and instead opted for civil contempt and a move towards lawsuits and court action to support their efforts to obtain further materials and testimony from witnesses in the Muller investigation.",

The Australian government sparked controversy last month for accepting two Rwandan militants previously accused of murdering tourists in targeted 1999 attacks in the Bwindi Impenetrable national park in Uganda. Australia had agreed to take the pair \u2013 Gregoire Nyaminani and Leonidas Bimenyimana \u2013 in a secret asylum swap deal with the US, a decision seemingly at odds with its otherwise hardline approach in using character grounds to deport non-citizens and block visa requests. The men were effectively in purgatory because the prosecution against them collapsed in 2007, but they couldn\u2019t be returned to Rwanda, and were not granted asylum in the US. But court documents show the US was keen to keep open the prospect of launching fresh criminal proceedings against the men after the case collapsed in 2007. US attorney Jeffrey A Taylor, argued the government should have the right to prosecute the pair again if new evidence came to light. \u201cThe Court should dismiss this indictment without prejudice, in order to preserve the ability of the United States to prosecute the defendants for their roles in this grave offense,\u201d Taylor argued, according to court documents. \u201cAs the Court is well aware, this horrendous crime was committed by members of ALIR \u2013 a terrorist organization.\u201d \u201cNumerous members of ALIR participated in the offense, not solely the defendants.

Immigration rulings show they were denied asylum, in part because they posed a risk to national security and were members of a terror group, the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda. But immigration courts also found they could not be returned to Rwanda because they were likely to be tortured again. Court documents and leaked diplomatic cables also reveal that Rwanda made repeated approaches to the US to secure the men\u2019s return. Senior Rwandan officials \u2013 including its prosecutor general and justice minister \u2013 assured the US in 2008 and 2011 that the men would receive fair trials and would not be tortured. The confessions previously obtained through torture would not be used against the men in a new trial, the Rwandan government said.

Let\u2019s get right into it ...</p> <p>Here\u2019s an email from <strong>Stephen Davenport</strong> in Indianapolis (who clarifies he\u2019s a non-American):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u2019t say that I understand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jun/11/usa-v-thailand-womens-world-cup-2019-live?page=with:block-5d0010ff8f0880dcae93cc54#block-5d0010ff8f0880dcae93cc54\">Rina Mapa\u2019s point</a>: this is the World Cup not a kid\u2019s tournament. It\u2019s patronizing to Thailand, frankly, to say the crowd should maybe fall into mournful silence on every goal. These people are there to support their team, and of curse they are going to cheer very goal. Or maybe all supporters except the USA\u2019s are allowed to do that for fear of accusations of \u201cjingoism\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another response to our Rina from <strong>Justin Madson</strong>, via email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m sure the USA fans are real concerned with celebrating the \u201cright\u201d way so as to not offend Rina\u2019s sensibilities. The Canadians would not ever celebrate goals in a rout, no sir. What does Rina want that might be appropriate? Golf claps? Silent vigil? Who\u2019s to say what\u2019s really appropriate here? Talking about jingoism in regards to a tournament when nations are pitted against one another seems a little futile, does it not?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rina Mapa</strong> offers a response to those responses:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It isn\u2019t the score I have a problem with. It\u2019s the celebrations. There is a respectful way to win.</p> </blockquote> <p>One from <strong>Jovo Beck</strong>, via email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I went from not caring much about the women\u2019s world cup, to drastically wanting the US to lose in the most painful way possible through this game. What a bunch of aholes. No class. Obnoxious. Spoiled children. Worse (but maybe accurate?) possible representation of the US possible. </p> <p>Thanks for providing a way to share this.</p> </blockquote> <p>This note from <strong>Val Candor</strong> sees the other side:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While I understand the calls for the US to let their collective foot off of the gas, I have to wonder at the finger wagging about sportsmanship, mercy rules, the size of the tournament, etc.</p> <p>There are plenty lopsided scores in the men\u2019s game yet you don\u2019t hear these kinds of criticisms.</p> <p>Sometimes you just get beat badly.</p> <p>In the U20 men\u2019s tournament two weeks ago, Norway beat Honduras 12-nil. Those are basically kids and yet there is an acknowledgement, even at that age that a bad loss is a bad loss.</p> <p>Why are boys assumed to be more emotionally mature as teenagers than grown women?</p> <p>If folks don\u2019t like the scoreline, fine. There are plenty of other teams that absolutely have the ability to kick the Americans out of the tournament.</p> <p>They can root for some sort of revenge then.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here\u2019s one from <strong>Aaron Pedersen</strong>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The handwringing about this scoreline is frustrating. First we have those who would want professional female athletes to abide by the rules for children. Then, we have a critique of the crowd cheering on their team? If France had pasted South Korea 6-0 and the Parc de Prince were echoing with \u201cAllez allez!\u201d would anyone bat an eyelash? Doubtful. Did pundits and commenters tie themselves in knots when Germany were up 7-0 in the World Cup semi final in 2014? Not even slightly.</p> <p>I\u2019m not here to say Thailand is Brazil, but this is a group where the US has to play Sweden, a team they\u2019ve not beaten in the last three tournaments. Goal differential matters. Will be waiting to see if the pearls are clutched if Sweden attempts the same feat this coming weekend.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s an email from <strong>Michael McCarthy</strong>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My wife\u2019s American and she was flabbergasted, as was I, by the total lack of class shown by the American players, bench, coaches and crowd. Any other team would have have stopped celebrating, and stepped off the gas, at 5, but not this lot. Nauseating.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another from <strong>Assaf Oron</strong>, via email: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fans are taking their cue from the players and the coach. Truly repulsive, the US player celebrations in the last few minutes. Can someone really be so clueless and possess such a single-channel mind? </p> <p>In the audience at least one could notice some fatigue when the camera zoomed on spectators.</p> <p>I had lots of sympathy to the US team coming in, but I\u2019m losing it really fast now.</p> </blockquote> <p>One from <strong>Barbara MacDonald Allport</strong>, via email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I find it odd that in a women\u2019s game we are talking about the mercy rule used in children\u2019s matches, but no mention of it as Germany is beating Estonia by the same margin in a men\u2019s match.</p> <p>Why are the women expected to play with less zeal?</p> </blockquote> <p>And, finally, from <strong>Peter Jansen</strong>, via email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although USA v Thailand is an embarrassment, the good news for the womens football is that this is very much an outlier. All of the other games have been surprisingly tight affairs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T21:37:50.328Z\">at 10.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0015348f0863265fe98021\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T20:57:00.083Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: USA 13-0 Thailand</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And there it is.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll be shutting down shortly. But you can have your say on today\u2019s match in the comments of Caitlin Murray\u2019s report from Reims. The inbox is brimming with reaction to the most lopsided scoreline in World Cup history, men\u2019s or women\u2019s. Responses are running the gamut from excitement to disgust. Let\u2019s get right into it ... Here\u2019s an email from Stephen Davenport in Indianapolis (who clarifies he\u2019s a non-American): I can\u2019t say that I understand Rina Mapa\u2019s point: this is the World Cup not a kid\u2019s tournament. It\u2019s patronizing to Thailand, frankly, to say the crowd should maybe fall into mournful silence on every goal. These people are there to support their team, and of curse they are going to cheer very goal. Or maybe all supporters except the USA\u2019s are allowed to do that for fear of accusations of \u201cjingoism\u201d. Another response to our Rina from Justin Madson, via email: I\u2019m sure the USA fans are real concerned with celebrating the \u201cright\u201d way so as to not offend Rina\u2019s sensibilities. The Canadians would not ever celebrate goals in a rout, no sir. What does Rina want that might be appropriate? Golf claps? Silent vigil? Who\u2019s to say what\u2019s really appropriate here? Talking about jingoism in regards to a tournament when nations are pitted against one another seems a little futile, does it not? Rina Mapa offers a response to those responses: It isn\u2019t the score I have a problem with. It\u2019s the celebrations. There is a respectful way to win. One from Jovo Beck, via email: I went from not caring much about the women\u2019s world cup, to drastically wanting the US to lose in the most painful way possible through this game. What a bunch of aholes. No class. Obnoxious. Spoiled children. Worse (but maybe accurate?) possible representation of the US possible. Thanks for providing a way to share this. This note from Val Candor sees the other side: While I understand the calls for the US to let their collective foot off of the gas, I have to wonder at the finger wagging about sportsmanship, mercy rules, the size of the tournament, etc. There are plenty lopsided scores in the men\u2019s game yet you don\u2019t hear these kinds of criticisms. Sometimes you just get beat badly. In the U20 men\u2019s tournament two weeks ago, Norway beat Honduras 12-nil. Those are basically kids and yet there is an acknowledgement, even at that age that a bad loss is a bad loss. Why are boys assumed to be more emotionally mature as teenagers than grown women? If folks don\u2019t like the scoreline, fine. There are plenty of other teams that absolutely have the ability to kick the Americans out of the tournament. They can root for some sort of revenge then. And here\u2019s one from Aaron Pedersen: The handwringing about this scoreline is frustrating. First we have those who would want professional female athletes to abide by the rules for children. Then, we have a critique of the crowd cheering on their team? If France had pasted South Korea 6-0 and the Parc de Prince were echoing with \u201cAllez allez!\u201d would anyone bat an eyelash? Doubtful. Did pundits and commenters tie themselves in knots when Germany were up 7-0 in the World Cup semi final in 2014? Not even slightly. I\u2019m not here to say Thailand is Brazil, but this is a group where the US has to play Sweden, a team they\u2019ve not beaten in the last three tournaments. Goal differential matters. Will be waiting to see if the pearls are clutched if Sweden attempts the same feat this coming weekend. Here\u2019s an email from Michael McCarthy: My wife\u2019s American and she was flabbergasted, as was I, by the total lack of class shown by the American players, bench, coaches and crowd. Any other team would have have stopped celebrating, and stepped off the gas, at 5, but not this lot. Nauseating. Another from Assaf Oron, via email: The fans are taking their cue from the players and the coach. Truly repulsive, the US player celebrations in the last few minutes. Can someone really be so clueless and possess such a single-channel mind? In the audience at least one could notice some fatigue when the camera zoomed on spectators. I had lots of sympathy to the US team coming in, but I\u2019m losing it really fast now. One from Barbara MacDonald Allport, via email: I find it odd that in a women\u2019s game we are talking about the mercy rule used in children\u2019s matches, but no mention of it as Germany is beating Estonia by the same margin in a men\u2019s match. Why are the women expected to play with less zeal? And, finally, from Peter Jansen, via email: Although USA v Thailand is an embarrassment, the good news for the womens football is that this is very much an outlier. All of the other games have been surprisingly tight affairs. Indeed! And there it is. The United States have kicked off their World Cup title defense with a resounding statement, getting a record-setting 13 goals from seven different scorers, also a record. Cold. Cutthroat. Clinical. Morgan (12\u2019, 53\u2019, 74\u2019, 81\u2019, 86\u2019) Lavelle (20\u2019, 56\u2019) Horan (32\u2019) Mewis (50\u2019, 54\u2019) Rapinoe (79\u2019) Pugh (84\u2019) Lloyd (92\u2019) Morgan lays it into the path of Lloyd, who coolly finishes at the far post to make it a baker\u2019s dozen. 90 min: Carli Lloyd nearly scores from close range but she\u2019s dispossessed at the last moment. The fourth official signals for three minutes of stoppage time. Morgan cracks a left-footed half-volley past the Thailand keeper ... and the rout is on. Pugh scores in her World Cup debut, this one directly off a Thailand goal kick. This scoreline, if it holds, would match the most lopsided in Women\u2019s World Cup history: Germany beat Argentina by the same score in 2007. ... and Morgan makes it 10 with her fourth goal of the night, collecting a pass from Rapinoe and ripping it into the back of the goal. This is not a misprint. Morgan is only second USA player to score four goals in a World Cup match after Michelle Akers, who scored five in a quarter-final win over Chinese Taipei in 1991. Rapinoe scores on a gorgeous end-to-end transition to make it nine ... 76 min: Morgan\u2019s hat trick is the fourth by a US player in a World Cup match after Michelle Akers (1991), Carin Jennings (1991) and Carli Lloyd (2015). Here\u2019s an email from Rina Mapa in Montreal: I don\u2019t mind about the score because what can you do, but it\u2019s the bloody obnoxious jingoistic crowd chanting that is just such poor sportsmanship. Jesus. It\u2019s like if a Triple A team played a hapless house league team and every goal was celebrated by the parents like it was a real achievement. Just awful. Morgan receives a pass at the top of the area, creates space with a nifty rollback touch, then fires a shot far post past the keeper. It\u2019s a hat trick for the US striker. The 8-0 scoreline, if it holds, would represent the most lopsided win for the United States in a World Cup match. 72 min: Teerasil Dangda is shown yellow for a two-footed challenge of Kelley O\u2019Hara. 71 min: Thailand make their final sub of the match as Warunee Phetwiset comes on for Orathai Srimanee. 69 min: Lloyd sends the Thailand keeper Chor Charoenying down in a heap while attacking the ball in the air. Jill Ellis makes a final sub for the United States as Mallory Pugh enters for Julie Ertz. 64 min: Thailand make their second substitution of the match as Teerasil Dangda enters for Rattikan Thongsombut. 60 min: It\u2019s Rapinoe, Lloyd, Morgan and Press playing in a front four for the United States as the match hits the hour mark. Writes Assaf Oron, via email: When coaching kids\u2019 games, this is the point when we tell our forwards to play defense and vice versa, bring in the kids that get the least playing time, etc. Let\u2019s see if the US has this sportsmanship in them. Similar sentiments from Rick McGahey, via email: When I coached youth soccer, we had a \u201cmercy rule\u201d when one team would get too far ahead of another. Coaches were encouraged to not keep attacking, and play the play around the back more. This has been a total training ground exercise for the USA, Thai players seem to have given up and are totally overmatched anyway (score is 7-0 as I write this, USA may well have more scored by the time I send this to you). What does Thailand get? Carli Lloyd coming off the bench, who presumably isn\u2019t there to take it easy on the opponents. I know these are adults and pros, but really the gap between these two teams is far too huge to justify the size of this tournament. 57 min: Jill Ellis makes a pair of substitutions with Lavelle and Heath coming off for Christen Press and Carli Lloyd. Indeed, that\u2019s a pair of attacking-minded subs for the Americans ... Lavelle sprints into a wide-open slot and gets off a perfectly hit shot for her second of the night and the USA\u2019s fourth in seven minutes and the extra point to their touchdown. Yikes on bikes. Mewis makes it a half-dozen from close range. This could get ugly. Oh wait ... Good service by Tobin Heath onto the path of Lindsey Horan, who flicks it to the far post and the waiting right foot of Alex Morgan. 52 min: Rose Lavelle is down after landing hard after a mid-air collision with a defender, but she\u2019s going to stay in the game. Rapinoe collects the ball and turns about 30 yards from the target, finds Mewis on the edge of the area between the midfield and back lines. Mewis takes a touch, then rips a shot that deflects off a defender into the goal. It\u2019s the 800th goal in Women\u2019s World Cup history. Free set of steak knives. 46 min: Thailand kick it off and the US quickly take possession. No substitutions for either side. It\u2019s early but it doesn\u2019t look like the Americans, who have already thrown numbers forward in this first minute after the intermission, are taking their foot off the gas. How do you rate the US team\u2019s performance so far? A quick look at my inbox should tell. Here\u2019s Richard McGahey, via email: Thai team is completely overmatched, misplay by center back on first goal, poor goalkeeping on second one. Listening to the game in the USA, announcers gushing about how well the USA is playing, in any other normal match commentators would be pointing out Thai errors. Anouncers just wanted a PK for the USA that the Argentine ref didn\u2019t call, and VAR turned down as well. As a USA guy, I want them to do well, but listening to this type of semi-propaganda instead of match analysis is bothersome. Agree 100%, Richard. We can only hope the classically understated Alexi Lalas is on the panel to help temper the discussion. Here\u2019s another email, this one from Charles Antaki: A while ago an aggressive bunch of Americans took on an apparently much inferior South East Asian group and scored some early hits, but eventually had to go home with their tails between their legs. Of course, history doesn\u2019t quite always repeats itself, but still ... Alas, we\u2019ll always have Mayweather over Pacquiao. And there\u2019s the half-time whistle. The United States are ahead 3-0 thanks to the head of Alex Morgan, the left foot of Rose Lavelle and the right foot of Lindsey Horan. The USA\u2019s 102-5 advantage in attacking-third passes tells the tale of the half. 45 min+1: Rapinoe sends it in low toward Crystal Dunn, who rolls her defender and sends a shot to the near post that\u2019s just saved. Corner to the US and a late barrage of chances from the Americans, but they can\u2019t manage a fourth. Lindsey Horan is taken down in the box toward the end of the sequence but the penalty is not given by the referee. 45 min: Rapinoe is pushed from behind and nearly cracks her skull on a defender\u2019s knee. She wins the foul and stands over the free kick from about 25 yards as the fourth official signals for two minutes of stoppage time. 44 min: Heath takes on a half-dozen Thailand defenders on a foray down the right flank, but holds it a bit too long and is finally dispossessed near the touch line. 42 min: Julie Ertz drifts forward to her usual midfield position and it briefly appears the US are playing in a rare 1-6-3 formation. A few more chances for the Americans. Thailand at sixes and sevens in the back as Lavelle nearly makes it 4-0 with her second goal, but it\u2019s cleared out for a USA corner. 36 min: Thailand makes the first substituiton of the game, removing the mobile defensive midfielder Wilaiporn Boothduang for Pikul Khueanpet. 34 min: And when Hope Solo saw the breadth of her domain, she wept for there were no more worlds to conquer. (In all seriousness: you can read the first dispatch from our newest guest columnist here.) Heath sends it in low ... and it\u2019s Lindsey Horan who emerges from a forest of ball-watching Thai defenders to pound it into the roof of the net. The rout is on. If it wasn\u2019t already. 31 min: The Americans win a free kick right on the edge of the area. Rapinoe and Heath stand over it ... 29 min: Thailand win a corner and record their first shot of the match. It doesn\u2019t go in. 25 min: The half-time possession numbers should be interesting for this one. A masterclass for the holders so far, whose relentless pace and width have kept Thailand from anything resembling an organized attack. O\u2019Hara has all the time in the world and acres of space to pick out a pass to Morgan, who drops it off to Lavelle in full gallop. She has Rapinoe wide open, but thestylish 24-year-old playmaker takes it for herself from the edge of the area and pounds a left-footed shot past the Thai keeper Chor Charoenying for her first World Cup goal. 16 min: The US are playing at a high tempo and have had a monopoly on possession through the opening quarter hour. A second goal seems like only a matter of time. Megan Rapinoe centers from the touch line to Kelley O\u2019Hara, who takes an aggressive touch past the first defender before delivering a feathery cross to Morgan, who heads it into the gaping net. It\u2019s the 29-year-old forward\u2019s 102nd international goal ... and she\u2019s already matched her goal-scoring haul from the 2015 World Cup. 5 min: The US appear to have scored an opener when Horan heads a long cross from Dahlkemper past the beaten keeper toward the inside of the far post, but Alex Morgan taps it in and is ruled offside. Might have stood had the forward not touched it. Alas. Robust \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d chants throughout Stade Auguste Delaune early on. 2 min: From the kickoff, Dahlkemper hits a long ball forward that\u2019s hammered back toward the middle third. The US are making no secret of their all-out press. They\u2019ll be hitting long balls forward to see how Thailand can handle the all-hands attack, particularly in the air. 1 min: After a brief spell of Fifa-mandated confusion and a delay in the kickoff ... we\u2019re off! The United States, who begin with seven players on the halfway line, are attacking from left to right in sharp all-red kits. Thailand are going from right to left in their turquoise strips. We\u2019re about five minutes from kickoff at Stade Auguste-Delaune. Sweden have won 2-0 over Chile to go top of Group F, leaving it to the United States to hold serve against Thailand. Both the Americans and Swedes are expected to win their first two group-stage matches, setting the table for a 20 June showdown at Stade Oc\u00e9ane in Le Havre for first place. But the US team should expect a far more difficult challenge from Thailand than their 2016 walkover: the Chaba Kaew did hold Australia to a draw in last year\u2019s Asian Cup semi-finals before falling in penalties, a result that punched their ticket to France. The United States are unbeaten in the seven Women\u2019s World Cup openers they\u2019ve played, most recently a 3-1 win over Australia four years ago. That includes five wins and a pair of draws: a 2-2 stalemate with North Korea in 2007 and a back-and-forth 3-3 slugfest with China in 1995. Sweden\u2019s Kosovare Asllani has broken a stalemate with an 84th-minute goal against Chile. You can follow Beau Dure\u2019s minute-by-minute commentary of the match between the United States\u2019 next two group-stage opponents here. The United States can expect robust support throughout their World Cup journey and today will be no exception. Fifa has announced that all three of the USA\u2019s group-stage matches are expected to be sellouts, starting with today\u2019s match at the 21,127-capacity Stade Auguste-Delaune. Our Caitlin Murray checks in from the ground: The American contingent is out in full force here in Reims, although I did spot two Thai jerseys among all the stars and stripes. After hearing reports of chaos at the opener in Paris, I checked out the gates and it looks like a more efficient setup here and fans were trickling in without any visible issue. It\u2019s a cool night and some dark, ominous clouds have seemed to clear, leaving a blue sky behind. Looks like a great night for some football/soccer (take your pick). The USA and Thailand have played only once down the years. The Americans won 9-0 in their first match following their disappointing 2016 Olympics showing on a chilly Columbus evening best remembered for US legend Heather O\u2019Reilly scoring in her farewell game and for Megan Rapinoe kneeling in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick during the national anthem. Carli Lloyd, the old warhorse who will become the ninth American woman to appear in four World Cups with today\u2019s start, scored the first of her three goals in the opening minute in addition to strikes from Christen Press, Tobin Heath, Crystal Dunn and Alex Morgan. Seventeen of the 18 US players who played in that match, including all of the goal-scorers, are in uniform for today\u2019s match. Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s lineups. Becky Sauerbrunn, the projected starter at center back for the United States, is out of the team due to a quadricep issue. Julie Ertz moves back to fill her place with Samantha Mewis getting the call in the midfield. As expected, Alyssa Naeher becomes the first goalkeeper not named Briana Scurry or Hope Solo to start a World Cup match for the United States since Saskia Webber in 1995. USA XI: Naeher, O\u2019Hara, Dahlkemper, Ertz, Dunn, Lavelle, Mewis, Horan, Heath, Morgan, Rapinoe Subs: Harris, Pugh, Sauerbrunn, Brian, Lloyd, Krieger, Davidson, Sonnett, Long, McDonald, Press, Franch Thailand XI: Chor Charoenying, Phetwiset, Saengkoon, Chinwong, Srangthaisong, Sung-Ngoen, Boothduang, Phancha, Intamee, Thongsombut, Nildhamrong Subs: Boonsing, Sritala, Khueanpet, Chucheun, Srimanee, Pengngam, Waenngoen, Saengchan, Dangda, Sornsai, Philawan, Sornpao Referee: Laura Fortunato (Argentina) Hello and welcome to Stade Auguste-Delaune for today\u2019s Group F opener between the United States and Thailand. The defending champions are here to kick off their title defense against the Chaba Kaew, who are playing in their second World Cup after making their debut in Canada four years ago. Jill Ellis\u2019s squad enters the tournament among the hot favorites to hoist the trophy, but it won\u2019t be easy. For starters, only two teams have successfully defended a World Cup since the second world war: the Brazil men (in 1962) and the Germany women (in 2007). And our Caitlin Murray, who\u2019s on the ground in Reins today, has exhaustively detailed the problems that could do the Americans in: including their vulnerability to the counterattack, a lack of depth at key positions, an occasionally shaky defense and an attack that can be too one-dimensional. Indeed, none of the Guardian\u2019s six expert prognosticators have the United States winning it all. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. The US will need to qualify out of a group including Thailand, Chile and Sweden. The first result is in the air right now with the Chile-Sweden match in Rennes having been suspended due to adverse weather in the 72nd minute. The teams for today\u2019s match should be announced momentarily and we\u2019ll fill you in as soon as they are. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Caitlin Murray\u2019s lookahead to what\u2019s sure to be a challenging World Cup title defense for the United States.",

The commitment, to be made in an amendment to the Climate Change Act laid in parliament on Wednesday, would make the UK the first member of the G7 group of industrialised nations to legislate for net zero emissions, Downing Street said. Environmental groups welcomed the goal but expressed disappointment that the plan would allow the UK to achieve it in part through international carbon credits, something Greenpeace said would \u201cshift the burden to developing nations\u201d. Last week No 10 dismissed claims from the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that such a target would cost \u00a31tn and could thus require spending cuts to public services. With May departing as prime minister next month, as soon as her successor is chosen, she has stepped up efforts on policy areas sidelined by Brexit, including new spending commitments, efforts to tackle modern slavery and the environment. The 2050 target, in an amendment being put down as a statutory instrument, meaning it does not require a vote of MPs, will be one of the most ambitious such goals set by a major polluting nation. France proposed net zero emissions legislation this year, while some smaller countries have gone for dates before 2050, such as Finland (2035) and Norway (2030), though the latter allows the buying of carbon offsets. While the 2050 date was recommended by the UK\u2019s official Committee on Climate Change (CCC), May has rejected its advice on international carbon credits, whereby a country can pay for cuts elsewhere in lieu of domestic emissions.

A Treasury source said Hammond fully backed the 2050 net zero target but had pushed for a full costing of the plan to make sure it did not negatively impact on other areas of public spending.

In the first case of its kind, Thiraviyarajah Subramaniyam, 37, a Tamil from Sri Lanka, appealed in the UK immigration tribunal on Tuesday against a Home Office refusal to allow him family resettlement in the UK. He is suffering from serious mental health problems as a result of torture he experienced in his home country followed by years of detention when he sought sanctuary in Australia, first on Christmas Island in 2013 followed by an extended period of detention on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. He is currently in the East Lorengau Transit Centre on Manus. Amnesty International has reported on \u201chellish\u201d conditions at the Manus camp.

Eden Hazard found De Bruyne with a clever pass but the Manchester City midfielder\u2019s drive was tipped over by keeper David Marshall, who then saved a long-distance effort from Axel Wetzel. </p> <p>The pressure kept building. Taylor got caught at the edge of the box taking a pass from Russell and De Bruyne drove wide of the target before a better effort had Marshall stretching to tip the ball over the bar. </p> <p>Armstrong was replaced by Ryan Fraser in the 32nd minute and it looked like the Scots would make it to the interval unscathed only for Lukaku to head in Hazard\u2019s cross from the byeline, when McTominay switched off for a moment. </p> <p>The stunned Scots should have gone 2-0 down four minutes into the second-half when Lukaku headed a cross from Thomas Meunier over the bar while under no pressure. </p> <p>Two minutes later Marshall beat away a terrific 25-yard free-kick from De Bruyne but after another ferocious drive from the Etihad stadium attacker had been parried by Marshall, Lukaku followed up past Taylor to return the ball into the net from 12 yards. </p> <p>Lukaku drove narrowly past the far post as did Hazard when he worked himself into a shooting position. Yet another strike from Lukaku missed the target although with 10 minutes remaining Fraser drew a decent save from Thibaut Courtois with a curling shot. </p> <p>The Belgium keeper then rushed from his goal to deny defender Scott McKenna before substitute James Forrest, on for Russell, failed to capitalise on the loose ball. Marshall denied De Bruyne as the home side returned fire but he was eventually beaten beaten by the brilliant Belgian who drilled in from the edge of the box. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d00167c8f0880dcae93cc84\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T21:03:23.256Z\">10.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Match report: Belarus 0-1 Northern Ireland</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This is from Ian Parker,</strong> the Press Association\u2019s man in Borisov:</p> <blockquote> <p>Paddy McNair\u2019s first international goal saw Northern Ireland snatch a 1-0 win over Belarus and make it four wins out of four in Euro 2020 qualifying. </p> <p>A late night in Borisov looked like ending in frustration for Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s men as they toiled in hot and humid conditions, but with four minutes left McNair found the breakthrough. The Middlesbrough midfielder took the ball from Jordan Jones on the left, skipped over the challenge of Sergei Kisylak, and struck a low shot under the diving Aleksandr Gutor. </p> <p>The goal sparked wild celebrations from the Northern Ireland players who have repeated the mantra of targeting 12 points from their opening four fixtures and can now celebrate achieving it. </p> <p>With half the group games gone, they have given themselves every chance of qualifying for a second consecutive European finals. The victory piles pressure on Holland, who may have two games in hand but will head to Germany in September nine points behind Northern Ireland, who are sitting pretty at the top of the group. </p> <p>It was another game where Northern Ireland had to dig deep before finding a late winner - just as they did in the reverse fixture in March, and in Saturdays\u2019 2-1 win over Estonia. That match was turned by substitutes Conor Washington, Josh Magennis and Jones, who were all brought into the starting line up three days later. </p> <p>Washington, in the shop window after being released by Sheffield United, threatened at the start of both halves. In the fourth minute, he drove to the edge of the area before dragging a shot narrowly wide of the goal. And at the start of the second half, his driven effort brought a first save of the night out of the Belarus goalkeeper. </p> <p>In between Northern Ireland had struggled to threaten Gutor\u2019s goal, but the game would open up considerably in the second half as both sides made changes. Stuart Dallas replaced Magennis and used his first touch to head clear Sergei Kisylak\u2019s free-kick from a dangerous position. </p> <p>Belarus introduced Denis Laptev, who has six goals in 10 for Dinamo Brest, and Northern Ireland\u2019s defenders quickly converged on the 6ft 4in man to block a shot from the penalty spot. Peacock-Farrell did well to turn away a low shot from Igor Stasevich after Kisylak rolled a free-kick into his path on the edge of the area, forcing the Leeds goalkeeper low down to his left. </p> <p>Northern Ireland responded at the other end where a stinging effort from substitute George Saville led to something of a scramble. Jones\u2019 cross rolled across the face of goal and the ball would not sit for Northern Ireland before Belarus got it behind for a corner. Michael Smith was next to try but his left footed effort curled just wide. </p> <p>Belarus hit back with a Yuri Kovalev driving towards the area before laying it off to Pavel Nekhaychik, whose shot went into the side-netting. But with time ticking down, McNair made the decisive strike to leave the 660 travelling fans in raptures. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d00148f8f0880dcae93cc64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T20:53:36.820Z\">9.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a report on Wales\u2019s defeat in Budapest:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gareth Bale\u2019s misery continued as he missed a gilt-edged chance and Wales were beaten by a late Hungary goal in their European Championship qualifier in Budapest.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I shall depart. It\u2019s been a lot of fun, unless you happen to be an Estonian defender. I leave you with this qualifying round-up. Bye! This meanwhile is the Press Association\u2019s report on Belgium\u2019s victory over Scotland: Scotland were handed a harsh lesson with a 3-0 defeat by Belgium at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels. Steve Clarke\u2019s side defended with a mixture of diligence and desperation in this 2020 European Championship qualifier only for all the good work to be undone just before half-time when a lapse of concentration ended with striker Romelu Lukaku heading in a cross from skipper Eden Hazard. In truth, the goal had been coming and the Manchester United striker added a second in the 57th minute with a strike and Steve Clarke\u2019s side had to work hard to prevent further damage before Kevin De Bruyne added a third in the final minute. Roberto Martinez\u2019s all-star team, ranked number one in the world, have won four out of four Group I fixtures while the Scots have six points from 12 and host Russia and Belgium in their next qualifying double-header in September, their task of qualifying for a major tournament for the first time since 1998 not becoming any easier. The nerves that the 4,000 or so members of the Tartan Army had would have increased with the news of skipper Andy Robertson\u2019s absence through injury, his place taken by 21-year-old Kilmarnock left-back Greg Taylor. The visitors had a clear-cut chance in the ninth minute when Burke found himself behind the Red Devils\u2019 defence from Armstrong\u2019s flick but he failed to connect properly with his angled-drive and the ball slipped past the far post. Belgium surged back. Eden Hazard found De Bruyne with a clever pass but the Manchester City midfielder\u2019s drive was tipped over by keeper David Marshall, who then saved a long-distance effort from Axel Wetzel. The pressure kept building. Taylor got caught at the edge of the box taking a pass from Russell and De Bruyne drove wide of the target before a better effort had Marshall stretching to tip the ball over the bar. Armstrong was replaced by Ryan Fraser in the 32nd minute and it looked like the Scots would make it to the interval unscathed only for Lukaku to head in Hazard\u2019s cross from the byeline, when McTominay switched off for a moment. The stunned Scots should have gone 2-0 down four minutes into the second-half when Lukaku headed a cross from Thomas Meunier over the bar while under no pressure. Two minutes later Marshall beat away a terrific 25-yard free-kick from De Bruyne but after another ferocious drive from the Etihad stadium attacker had been parried by Marshall, Lukaku followed up past Taylor to return the ball into the net from 12 yards. Lukaku drove narrowly past the far post as did Hazard when he worked himself into a shooting position. Yet another strike from Lukaku missed the target although with 10 minutes remaining Fraser drew a decent save from Thibaut Courtois with a curling shot. The Belgium keeper then rushed from his goal to deny defender Scott McKenna before substitute James Forrest, on for Russell, failed to capitalise on the loose ball. Marshall denied De Bruyne as the home side returned fire but he was eventually beaten beaten by the brilliant Belgian who drilled in from the edge of the box. This is from Ian Parker, the Press Association\u2019s man in Borisov: Paddy McNair\u2019s first international goal saw Northern Ireland snatch a 1-0 win over Belarus and make it four wins out of four in Euro 2020 qualifying. A late night in Borisov looked like ending in frustration for Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s men as they toiled in hot and humid conditions, but with four minutes left McNair found the breakthrough. The Middlesbrough midfielder took the ball from Jordan Jones on the left, skipped over the challenge of Sergei Kisylak, and struck a low shot under the diving Aleksandr Gutor. The goal sparked wild celebrations from the Northern Ireland players who have repeated the mantra of targeting 12 points from their opening four fixtures and can now celebrate achieving it. With half the group games gone, they have given themselves every chance of qualifying for a second consecutive European finals. The victory piles pressure on Holland, who may have two games in hand but will head to Germany in September nine points behind Northern Ireland, who are sitting pretty at the top of the group. It was another game where Northern Ireland had to dig deep before finding a late winner - just as they did in the reverse fixture in March, and in Saturdays\u2019 2-1 win over Estonia. That match was turned by substitutes Conor Washington, Josh Magennis and Jones, who were all brought into the starting line up three days later. Washington, in the shop window after being released by Sheffield United, threatened at the start of both halves. In the fourth minute, he drove to the edge of the area before dragging a shot narrowly wide of the goal. And at the start of the second half, his driven effort brought a first save of the night out of the Belarus goalkeeper. In between Northern Ireland had struggled to threaten Gutor\u2019s goal, but the game would open up considerably in the second half as both sides made changes. Stuart Dallas replaced Magennis and used his first touch to head clear Sergei Kisylak\u2019s free-kick from a dangerous position. Belarus introduced Denis Laptev, who has six goals in 10 for Dinamo Brest, and Northern Ireland\u2019s defenders quickly converged on the 6ft 4in man to block a shot from the penalty spot. Peacock-Farrell did well to turn away a low shot from Igor Stasevich after Kisylak rolled a free-kick into his path on the edge of the area, forcing the Leeds goalkeeper low down to his left. Northern Ireland responded at the other end where a stinging effort from substitute George Saville led to something of a scramble. Jones\u2019 cross rolled across the face of goal and the ball would not sit for Northern Ireland before Belarus got it behind for a corner. Michael Smith was next to try but his left footed effort curled just wide. Belarus hit back with a Yuri Kovalev driving towards the area before laying it off to Pavel Nekhaychik, whose shot went into the side-netting. But with time ticking down, McNair made the decisive strike to leave the 660 travelling fans in raptures. Here\u2019s a report on Wales\u2019s defeat in Budapest: Gareth Bale\u2019s misery continued as he missed a gilt-edged chance and Wales were beaten by a late Hungary goal in their European Championship qualifier in Budapest. Bale \u2013 whose future at Real Madrid remains shrouded in uncertainty after a miserable end to the season in Spain \u2013 failed to convert from close range in a tight game of few opportunities. The Wales manager, Ryan Giggs, could not have wished for the second-half chance to fall to a better man than the 29-year-old but he could not convert and his team paid the price. Much more here: \u201cThink I\u2019ll go and watch Chernobyl to cheer myself up,\u201d says Simon McMahon, after Scotland were handed a 3-0 hiding by Begium. \u201cMaybe Matt Dony feels like joining me?\u201d In other news, Sky are reporting that Slaven Bilic is poised to take over as West Bromwich Albion\u2019s head coach, and Jonathan Woodgate is \u201cclose to being appointed\u201d by Middlesbrough. I\u2019ve got all of tonight\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifying scorelines for you: Group C Belarus 0-1 Northern Ireland Germany 8-0 Estonia Group E Azerbaijan 1-5 Slovakia Hungary 1-0 Wales Group H Albania 2-0 Moldova Andorra 0-4 France Iceland 2-1 Turkey Group I Kazakhstan 4-0 San Marino Belgium 3-0 Scotland Russia 1-0 Cyprus Group J Greece 2-3 Armenia Italy 2-1 Bosnia-Herzegovina Liechtenstein 0-2 Finland Over at the women\u2019s World Cup, the USA now lead Thailand 10-0 with another 10 minutes to play. They have had 35 shots, to Thailand\u2019s two. This is an absolute wondergoal! Destined to be forgotten because, well, it\u2019s for Greece, in a losing effort at home to Armenia, but Kostas Fortounis just danced past everybody before rolling into an empty net. Kevin de Bruyne hits a low, hard, pinpoint shot from just outside the area, and Belgium\u2019s victory is complete! The final whistle has now gone in Brussels, so that\u2019s their lot. That wraps up victory for Albania! Ylber Ramadani\u2019s low shot from just outside the area arrows inside the near post! Marco Verratti has surely won this for Italy! It\u2019s a low shot from about 16 yards, not very hard but extremely accurate, and there\u2019s no stopping it on its way inside the far post. Oh, do stop it. Leroy Sane had had two previous goals disallowed, though, so is likely to be happy about finally having one that stands. I\u2019m a little slow in bringing bad news for the Welsh, of a late goal for Mate Patkai. It\u2019s a long, high ball into the area, which attracts all nearby defenders to attempt to win it, but instead it drops loose to Patkai, who slams it in! That\u2019s a great strike from Middlesbrough\u2019s Paddy McNair, who cuts inside his marker on the left of the area and, from near the byline, slaps a low shot past the keeper! Northern Ireland are as I type at the top of Group C, albeit with their next four games being against the Netherlands, Germany, the Netherlands again, and then Germany again. It looks like Armenia might have wrapped this one up, after re-extending their lead over Greece to two goals. Germany have finally extended their lead, a humiliating 17 minutes after their last goal. Timo Werner, who came on for Reus back in the 65th minute, with the strike. A couple of match updates, which I\u2019ve cribbed off the Press Association: Northern Ireland made a bright start to the second half. First a Jones cross from the left caused chaos as it span away from the goalkeeper. Magennis got a touch to play it back to McNair but his control let him down and Belarus scrambled it away. But Northern Ireland kept the pressure on and Washington brought a decent save from Gutor with a driven effort. Belarus responded as Lewis was booked for a foul on Igor Shitov in a dangerous position, but Stuart Dallas, just on for Magennis, cleared the free-kick with his first touch. Barely a minute later, Northern Ireland\u2019s defenders converged on Belarus substitute Denis Laptev to block his shot from the penalty spot. Meanwhile in Hungary: Gareth Bale missed a glorious chance on the hour after Wales produced the best football of the match. Brooks swerved away from his marker to free Lawrence and he squared the ball to leave Bale with only Gulacsi to beat. But Bale scooped his shot weakly and Gulacsi collected easily. Wales had lost Ampadu to injury soon after the restart and he was replaced by Matthew Smith. \u201cThe Wales game might not be a thriller, but Hungary are demonstrating some impressively agricultural solutions to the problems posed by Wales\u2019 pace,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cAnd after creating the best opening of the game, Wales have bemoaned Bale\u2019s lack of a right foot. So, yeah. Going great.\u201d Talking of thrashings: Germany have had a goal chalked off for offside, and they\u2019re not happy about it. Jose Carlos Zeca has pulled a goal back for Greece against Armenia. It was quite nice. Gnabry makes it six of the best for Germany, turning in a left-wing centre with the nonchalance of someone who knows that nothing really matters at this point. France think they\u2019re handing out a thrashing, which they kind of are. However, there are more emphatic scorelines about, such as ... Belgium double their lead, Lukaku poking in the loose ball after Kevin de Bruyne\u2019s shot is saved! The latest of a string of white-shirted players to score tap-ins from low cross tonight is Benjamin Kallman, who extends Finland\u2019s lead in Liechtenstein. Edin Visca just came ever so close to restoring Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s lead in Turin, only for Salvatore Sirigu to pull off a super stop. That\u2019s a cracker! Insigne is lurking on the edge of the area as Italy prepare a corner. It\u2019s lifted over everybody and onto his right foot, whence it is cracked on the volley inside the near post! The Press Association\u2019s half-time take on Hungary v Wales doesn\u2019t paint it as a great thriller: Hungary and Wales remained goalless at the break. In what was proving a tight contest, Joe Allen volleyed wide from 25 yards and Hungary centre-back headed Balazs Dzsudzsak\u2019s corner into side netting. But chances were very much at a premium with defences on top. All half-timely whistles have now blown, so go and have a brief lie-down. Simon McMahon is feeling guilty about his optimistic Scottish-themed message: \u201cCue half time music by Jim Diamond - I Should Have Known Better.\u201d A high, looping cross from the left is acrobatically scissor-kicked into the net, off the goalkeeper, by Florian Thauvin! Belgium finally make the breakthrough! Eden Hazard with the twinkling toes dancing through the area, and his dinked cross finds Romelu Lukaku\u2019s capable forehead! Dorukhan Tokoz heads in a right-wing corner to heave Turkey to within a single goal of Iceland. Unlikely stat alert: \u201cSo far so good for Scotland,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cEven though a point would be unexpected in Belgium tonight, early signs are that under Clarke, we will at least be competitive, and might even do something in qualifying. Incidentally, starters Charlie Mulgrew, Johnny Russell and Stuart Armstrong, sub John Souttar and the injured Andy Robertson are all ex-Dundee United players. Make of that what you will.\u201d Norwich\u2019s Teemu Pukki with a Dzekoesque tap-in to give his side the lead in Liechtenstein. Marco Reus scores a free-kick to put Germany five to the good against Estonia. I\u2019ve now seen the Dzeko goal, and it was a tap-in. A couple of other goals that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet: Iceland are 2-0 up against Turkey, Ragnar Sigurdsson with his second of the game, and Armenia are 2-0 up in Greece, Gevorg Ghazaryan with it. Also, Wissam Ben Yedder has doubled France\u2019s lead in Andorra. Belgium are leading Scotland 8-1 on goal attempts, 2-0 on shot on goal, have had five corners to Scotland\u2019s none, and have enjoyed 66% of possession and a passing accuracy of 92%, to Scotland\u2019s 33%/78%, The score remains 0-0. I haven\u2019t seen the goal yet, but it has been described as a tap-in. I\u2019ve just seen the incident that led to that Germany penalty, and it was weak. I\u2019m not sure why, when you play for Germany, you\u2019re up against Estonia at home and you\u2019re 3-0 up after 25 minutes, you\u2019d think it might be necessary to dive to win a penalty. That, from Leon Goretzka, was purely for the love of diving. I think Germany might win this one. Gundogan appears to be playing a blinder, having had a significant hand in two of the first three goals, and now he\u2019s banged in a penalty to put his side four up. Defence? Gudmundsson\u2019s free-kick bounces across the area, and Sigurdsson turns it in at the far post. This might get messy. Joshua Kimmich lifts the ball into the area, and Leon Koretzka glances his header home! Germany have doubled their lead over Estonia, Leroy Sane running onto a chipped pass on the left of the area before centring for Serge Gnabry, who taps in. Germany, currently below Northern Ireland in Group C (with a game in hand), move ahead of Estonia, Marco Reus turning a low cross into the roof of the net. France appear to be stepping nimbly over this potential banana skin, Kylian Mbappe skipping into the penalty area before dinking a shot over the goalkeeper to give the world champions the lead. Armenia have taken a 1-0 lead in Greece. That\u2019s in Group J, which is currently topped by Italy. Anyway, and more pertinently, off has been kicked at all of tonight\u2019s games. Pre-match fan displays can look very good indeed, but at the risk of coming over a bit Guardian it does rather feel like an almost perversely unnecessary use of plastic. Can\u2019t people just communicate their support through the medium of song? Not just foam, but people in unusual hats too! Nizhny Novgorod is truly the place to be tonight. This looks fun. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we control the game,\u201d says Roberto Martinez of Belgium\u2019s meeting with the Scots. \u201cWe need to be patient, but with a real high tempo on the ball.\u201d Steve Clarke has been asked about Andy Robertson\u2019s absence: Its obviously disappointing to lose Andy. It\u2019s disappointing for Andy as well. He tried everything he could, but no good. Great chance for Greg Taylor. What have you said to Taylor, he\u2019s asked. \u201cYou\u2019re playing left-back,\u201d Clarke responds. Ryan Giggs calls for \u201ca little patience and building up the play\u201d, and thinks if they can manage that \u201cwe should be OK\u201d. Wales are in Budapest tonight. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be difficult but the plan is obviously to come away with three points at least.\u201d At least three points? How many does he want? And the full Scotland and Belgium line-ups. Apparently Robertson was ruled out with a hamstring injury: Belgium: Courtois, Alderweireld, Kompany, Vertonghen, Meunier, Tielemans, Witsel, Thorgan Hazard, De Bruyne, Lukaku, Eden Hazard. Subs: Mignolet, Vermaelen, Carrasco, Januzaj, Praet, Castagne, Dendoncker, Benteke, Origi, Mertens, Batshuayi, Sels.

Subs: Ward, Neil Taylor, Mepham, Smith, Vaulks, Woodburn, Matondo, Lockyer, Wilson, Vokes, Adam Davies, Roberts. Referee: Matej Jug (Slovenia). A few of the continent\u2019s giants are in action tonight. Here are some selected line-ups: Andorra v France Andorra: Gomes, Jesus Rubio, Llovera, Lima, San Nicolas, Martinez, Rebes, Vales, Cervos, Alaez, Vieira. Subs: Pol, Emili Garcia, Clemente, Sanchez, Sanchez Soto, Moreno, Marc Garcia, Rodriguez, Jordi Rubio.

Early kick-off update: Kazakhstan have beaten San Marino 4-0, and Azerbaijan are 1-5 down at home to Slovakia, deep into stoppage time. Here is Scotland\u2019s team to play Belgium, and Andy Robertson is not in it: No less than 11 European Championship qualifying fixtures kick off at 7.45pm BST this evening, including Belgium v Scotland, Hungary v Wales, Belarus v Northern Ireland, Italy v Bosnia-Herzegovina and France\u2019s attempt to recover from their 2-0 weekend defeat in Turkey in Andorra. So an evening of considerable excitement awaits. Some things to look out for, then: The Hungary manager, Marco Rossi, says Daniel James\u2019s speed makes him feel all tingly. \u201cIn the last years I don\u2019t remember one player that gave me this sensation,\u201d he said. \u201cHis acceleration is so peculiar.\u201d What\u2019s more, he won\u2019t be able to guide his players through their Welsh challenge because of a touchline ban. Wales might make changes. \u201cIt may be a case of freshening it up,\u201d said Ryan Giggs. \u201cIt\u2019s important we come away with something from the game but there are still 15 points to play for after this one.\u201d Belgium thrashed Scotland 4-0 in a friendly last September. \u201cIt was a relatively new squad then, a lot of changes and we have probably had 10 months together and we have bonded and know how to play with each other,\u201d says Andy Robertson. \u201cWe made disastrous mistakes in that game and that\u2019s what we need to cut out. We need to be a lot more streetwise and try to frustrate them and the longer it goes, hopefully that happens and we grow in confidence.\u201d Andorra are preparing to party. \u201cPlaying against the world champions France, a country we like a lot because of its proximity, will be a celebration,\u201d says their striker, Juli S\u00e1nchez. Italy have not conceded for 568 minutes. Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina will be out to break that run in Turin tonight. And so very much more. So gird your loins and draw your breath, tonight is going to be a very big lot of fun*. * fun not guaranteed",

Right-back Kelley O\u2019Hara was given space and time to loft a cross to an unmarked Morgan, who easily headed the ball past goalkeeper Sukanya Chor Charoenying. For Thailand, it only got worse from there. Rose Lavelle scored eight minutes later with a low drive that Chor Charoenying got a palm to but could not stop.

In that sense, the 13-0 final scoreline \u2013 a World Cup record - was perhaps not a surprise. Alex Morgan set a mark of her own, her five goals tied the tournament for the most by one player in a single game. \u201cWe really just came into the game really wanting to showcase ourselves,\u201d Morgan said after the game. \u201cEvery goal matters in this tournament and that\u2019s what we were working on.\u201d It took the Americans 12 minutes to get on the board. Right-back Kelley O\u2019Hara was given space and time to loft a cross to an unmarked Morgan, who easily headed the ball past goalkeeper Sukanya Chor Charoenying. For Thailand, it only got worse from there. Rose Lavelle scored eight minutes later with a low drive that Chor Charoenying got a palm to but could not stop. By the end of the massacre, Lavelle and Samantha Mewis had scored two each, Morgan five, while Carli Lloyd, Lindsey Horan, Megan Rapinoe and Mallory Pugh had one each. For the Americans, who had been asked repeatedly over the past few days for their thoughts on France\u2019s convincing 4-0 opening win over South Korea, Tuesday\u2019s dismantling of Thailand felt like an emphatic response. It was also perhaps a message to their critics. The Americans have had an up-and-down run-in to this World Cup, something Rapinoe openly admitted here in Reims ahead of Tuesday\u2019s match. But the Americans have insisted their preparations have been about leaving no stone unturned in order to peak at the right time. While critics may accuse the Americans of running up the score, the players insisted they showed Thailand respect by continuing to attack. \u201cThe way we respect our opponent is we don\u2019t take it lightly,\u201d Julie Ertz said. \u201cWe take any opponent we have very seriously. We prepare the same way. We have our scouting reports. We train with intensity. And that\u2019s how we show we\u2019re not going to take any opponent lightly.\u201d O\u2019Hara added: \u201cIt is a tournament \u2013 goal differential matters. At the end of the day, we can\u2019t feel bad for scoring as many goals as possible in any game you\u2019re playing.\u201d The 13-0 score was USA\u2019s \u2013 and, indeed any team\u2019s \u2013 largest victory in a World Cup. Before that, a 7-0 win over Chinese Taipei in the first-ever Women\u2019s World Cup in 1991 held the US record. Germany held the previous World Cup record, a 11-0 win against Argentina in 2007. Rapinoe said that, after the match ended, it occurred to her the US may have set a new record. \u201cI was hoping we\u2019d beat Germany,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cWe always want to have any world record, obviously, and everything we can get over the Germans, we\u2019ll take it.\u201d Morgan\u2019s five goals surely put to rest any fears that the striker was falling out of form, after she had failed to score in USA\u2019s final three warm-up matches before the World Cup. She now has 33 goals in her last 37 games. For Thailand, this lopsided defeat puts their chances of advancing out of the group stage in peril. Third-place teams with the best records will advance and the Thai\u2019s goal difference is now ugly to look at. Sweden and the US are huge favorites to claim the top two spots in the group. \u201cWe accept the score today,\u201d said Thailand coach Nuengrutai Srathongvian. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done enough. We accept that [the US] are very strong and they were excellent all around. We accept our mistakes and we are going to improve.\u201d This was Thailand\u2019s second time at a Women\u2019s World Cup. They made their debut four years ago and managed a close win over Ivory Coast but got thumped by 4-0 by both Germany and Norway as they went out at the group stage. The US, of course, went on to win that tournament. Up next, the Americans head to Paris where they will take on Chile, who lost to Sweden earlier in the day, on Sunday. Thailand will face Sweden in Nice.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will finally appear in public to launch his campaign to be Tory leader on Wednesday, as one of his rivals cast doubt on whether he could be trusted with access to Britain\u2019s nuclear codes. Johnson, the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May, will take questions for the first time in the contest at his formal campaign event, where he will saying that \u201ckicking the can\u201d on Brexit would mean \u201ckicking the bucket\u201d for the Conservative party. The former foreign secretary will want the focus of his launch to be on his Brexit policy, but his character and avoidance of scrutiny in the contest so far came under attack from rival candidates on Tuesday. Rory Stewart, an outsider in the leadership race, became the first contender to criticise the former foreign secretary personally when he cast doubt on his competence. Speaking to an audience of 600 members of the public, Stewart said: \u201cDo you really feel that this is the person that you want engaging in the detail of the future of your health and education system? Is this the person you want writing the instruction to the nuclear submarines? Is this the man that you want embodying your nation and guiding you through the most difficult choice we\u2019ve faced for 50 years?\u201d He said he \u201ctrusted the Conservative members to arrive at the correct answer\u201d. Two other candidates, Mark Harper and Matt Hancock, also implicitly criticised Johnson\u2019s failure to submit himself to scrutiny in the contest so far, as all of the contenders apart from Johnson and Jeremy Hunt confirmed that they were happy to take part in television debates. Harper, who has about six public backers among MPs, said all candidates must be open to public questioning and scrutiny, and that any other route would risk a similar situation to the 2017 general election, when Theresa May\u2019s campaign style stumbled. \u201cIf you want to lead this country, you have to be prepared to set out your stall,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you have to open yourself up to questioning and be prepared to level with people and be questioned about it.

Everybody should participate in the proposed TV debates. And I think we\u2019ve got to ask the question, why not? I\u2019ve got nothing to hide and that\u2019s why I am here.\u201d David Lammy, a Labour MP who supports the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum, criticised Johnson for wanting to \u201cforce a destructive no deal on our country, when he doesn\u2019t have the guts to face the people\u201d. A source on Johnson\u2019s campaign said the frontrunner would take questions from the media at his launch and was still considering bids from BBC and other broadcasters for him to take part in live hustings. Johnson is expected to be asked about his admission of having tried cocaine in the past, after his fellow contender, Michael Gove, became mired in a controversy about his previous use of the class A drug. He is also likely to be questioned about how he can square his promise to hardline Brexit supporters that he is prepared to ditch May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and leave with no deal if necessary on 31 October with his suggestions to soft Brexiters that he would try to avoid leaving without a deal. Johnson is expected to say in his speech: \u201cNow is the time to unite this country and unite this society, and we cannot begin that task until we have delivered on the primary request of the people, the one big thing they have asked us to do: after three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on 31 October. \u201cWe simply will not get a result if we give the slightest hint that we want to go on kicking the can down the road with yet more delay.

And we can do it again,\u201d he will say. Sajid Javid, another leadership contender, is also planning to launch his campaign on Wednesday, calling for change at the top of the Conservatives. \u201cI believe now more than ever that this is a moment for a new kind of leadership and a new kind of leader,\u201d he will say. \u201cA leader is not just for Christmas, or just for Brexit. So we can\u2019t risk going with someone who feels like the short-term, comfort zone choice. We need tomorrow\u2019s leader, today.\u201d Javid released a leadership video on Tuesday highlighting his background as the son of a bus driver who arrived in the UK from Pakistan in 1961 with \u00a31 in his pocket. \u201cThere was too much chance in my story, and too many kids I grew up with weren\u2019t so lucky.

The report, from the Energy Efficiency Council, found that adopting the measures used in Germany would save the average Australian household $790 a year on power bills and create 70,000 extra full-time equivalent jobs. </p> <p><strong>Robots will not steal workers\u2019 jobs nor suppress pay, but fear of automation may be contributing to stagnant wages,</strong> according to Deloitte Access Economics. At the National Press Club on Wednesday, Deloitte partner Chris Richardson will argue that improving technology is shifting the mix of skills in demand with employers, but fears of mass unemployment are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/11/robots-wont-steal-your-jobs-but-that-fear-may-be-contributing-to-stagnant-wages-deloitte-says\">\u201centirely misplaced\u201d</a>.

The mission to increase Russian influence on the continent is being led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman based in St Petersburg who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose troll factory, according to US special counsel Robert Mueller, ran an extensive social media campaign in 2016 to help elect Donald Trump.

Critics acclaimed its songs as evidence that, after almost a decade of straying from the straight and narrow, he was prepared once again to bare his soul.</p> <p>But Dylan, as usual, was restless. He was looking for something new, and he found it when Oppenheim introduced him to the Camargue, a land of salt marshes, wild horses and a village called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. There he witnessed the annual gathering of Roma, arriving from across Europe for the spring festival in celebration of Saint Sarah. It was the general sense of a travelling community with a natural way of expressing its culture that inspired the next and typically unexpected phase of his career. \u201cThere was a Rolling Thunder energy and that was his invention,\u201d Joan Baez says in Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/11/bob-dylan-rolling-thunder-revue-martin-scorsese\">the documentary by Martin Scorsese released this week on Netflix</a>. Using verite and concert footage, some of it first seen in Dylan\u2019s long-buried feature film Renaldo and Clara, Scorsese reframes that energy while adding a layer of meta-reality that reflects Dylan\u2019s enduring fascination with masks, disguises and alternative facts.</p> <h2>Media roundup</h2> <p>The <strong>ABC</strong> reports that the NSW Labor leadership hopeful Chris Minns \u201creceived a $5,000 \u2018moving expenses\u2019 payment as part of a six-figure donation to Labor by an association linked to a Sydney businessman with <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-12/alp-invoice-reveals-expenses-payment-to-chris-minns/11191042\">deep links to the Chinese Communist party</a>\u201d, and that Chris Bowen, Labor\u2019s federal health spokesman, \u201cwas the beneficiary of the $100,000 donation from which Mr Minns\u2019s payment was drawn\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday June 12. Top stories Australia is missing an opportunity to easily meet its emissions targets through energy efficiency measures, new research has found. Australia could cut greenhouse gas emissions halfway to its Paris agreement target, and save $7.7bn a year in bills, by adopting existing global standards on household and business appliances such as hot-water heaters. The report, from the Energy Efficiency Council, found that adopting the measures used in Germany would save the average Australian household $790 a year on power bills and create 70,000 extra full-time equivalent jobs. Robots will not steal workers\u2019 jobs nor suppress pay, but fear of automation may be contributing to stagnant wages, according to Deloitte Access Economics. At the National Press Club on Wednesday, Deloitte partner Chris Richardson will argue that improving technology is shifting the mix of skills in demand with employers, but fears of mass unemployment are \u201centirely misplaced\u201d. In the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Richardson says despite technological change accelerating for decades, unemployment is \u201cclose to record lows around the world\u201d. Russia is seeking to bolster its presence in at least 13 countries across Africa by building relations with existing rulers, striking military deals, and grooming a new generation of leaders and undercover agents, leaked documents have revealed. The mission to increase Russian influence on the continent is being led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman based in St Petersburg who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose troll factory, according to US special counsel Robert Mueller, ran an extensive social media campaign in 2016 to help elect Donald Trump. The leaked documents show the scale of recent Prigozhin-linked operations in Africa, and Moscow\u2019s ambition to turn the region into a strategic hub. World Carbon emissions from the global energy industry rose at the fastest rate in almost a decade in 2018 after surprise swings in global temperatures stoked extra demand for fossil fuels, helping to drive the world\u2019s biggest jump in gas consumption for more than 30 years and a second consecutive annual increase for coal use. High court judges in Botswana have ruled that laws criminalising same-sex relations are unconstitutional and should be struck down, in a major victory for gay rights campaigners in Africa. Boris Johnson recommended that the UK allow Saudi Arabia to buy British bomb parts expected to be deployed in Yemen, days after an airstrike on a factory in the country had killed 14 people in 2016. There were \u201cserious problems with the culture, morale and behaviour\u201d of Oxfam staff responding to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, according to a damning report, which has found that the charity failed to disclose allegations of child abuse. Radiohead have released a vast collection of unreleased tracks made during the sessions for 1997 album OK Computer, after a MiniDisc archive owned by frontman Thom Yorke was hacked last week by an unnamed person, who reportedly asked for a $150,000 ransom to return the recordings. Opinion and analysis Women who have abortions are only just now beginning to see themselves depicted on screen, but for a certain subgroup \u2013 women who are already mothers when they decide to terminate \u2013 the taboo is stronger than ever. But the second season of ABC TV\u2019s comedy-drama The Letdown is tackling it head-on. \u201cMothers have more abortions than anyone else,\u201d the show\u2019s co-creator Sarah Scheller says. \u201cAudrey\u2019s arc is about coming to a point where she doesn\u2019t feel shame about her decision.\u201d If renewables weren\u2019t getting cheaper, would Australia still want to tackle climate change? And if world demand for coal wasn\u2019t declining, would we still want to stop the Adani coalmine being built? After 30 years of democratic failures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the past five technological leaps have succeeded where elections did not, writes Richard Denniss. But what does it say about Australia if we are only willing to save ourselves, and our kids, if we can get a good deal on the price of renewables? Sport In the women\u2019s World Cup, New Zealand came with two minutes of a draw against the Netherlands, only to have their hearts broken by the substitute Jill Roord. In other games Sweden defeated Chile 2-0, striking late after torrential rain stopped play and the US crushed Thailand. In the Cricket World Cup: Bangladesh v Sri Lanka was rained off, in a tournament-record third abandonment in the space of five days. A decision was taken to abandon the game without a ball being bowled shortly before 2pm \u2013 three-and-a-half hours after play was scheduled to begin \u2013 meaning both sides took a point. Bangladesh coach Steve Rhodes has bemoaned the lack of reserve days. Thinking time: \u2018There was a Rolling Thunder energy\u2019 In May 1975, his marriage breaking up, Bob Dylan spent six weeks in the south of France. His host, an artist named David Oppenheim, had recently provided a painting for the back cover of Blood on the Tracks, an album of seemingly confessional songs that had taken Dylan back to the top of the charts. Critics acclaimed its songs as evidence that, after almost a decade of straying from the straight and narrow, he was prepared once again to bare his soul. But Dylan, as usual, was restless. He was looking for something new, and he found it when Oppenheim introduced him to the Camargue, a land of salt marshes, wild horses and a village called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. There he witnessed the annual gathering of Roma, arriving from across Europe for the spring festival in celebration of Saint Sarah. It was the general sense of a travelling community with a natural way of expressing its culture that inspired the next and typically unexpected phase of his career. \u201cThere was a Rolling Thunder energy and that was his invention,\u201d Joan Baez says in Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story, the documentary by Martin Scorsese released this week on Netflix. Using verite and concert footage, some of it first seen in Dylan\u2019s long-buried feature film Renaldo and Clara, Scorsese reframes that energy while adding a layer of meta-reality that reflects Dylan\u2019s enduring fascination with masks, disguises and alternative facts. Media roundup The ABC reports that the NSW Labor leadership hopeful Chris Minns \u201creceived a $5,000 \u2018moving expenses\u2019 payment as part of a six-figure donation to Labor by an association linked to a Sydney businessman with deep links to the Chinese Communist party\u201d, and that Chris Bowen, Labor\u2019s federal health spokesman, \u201cwas the beneficiary of the $100,000 donation from which Mr Minns\u2019s payment was drawn\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald says there is a crisis in hospital wait times in NSW, with \u201crecord numbers of patients swamping emergency departments\u201d. Queensland treasurer Jackie Trad appears on the front page of the Australian below the headline Gas tax hike: Treasurer sparks energy backlash. Coming up Australia hope to bounce back from defeat against India when they face Pakistan in their next cricket World Cup assignment tonight.

I\u2019ll let this sentence speak for itself. </p> \n  <p>In a comment piece (paywalled), titled <em>\u201cRory Stewart just gave a speech that blew his Tory leadership rivals out of the water</em>\u201d, Deacon writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Rory Stewart is different from the other Tory leadership contenders in just about every significant way. And just about every insignificant way, too. All the rest have launched their campaigns in the usual stuffy and soulless Westminster conference rooms. This evening, Mr Stewart launched his campaign in a crimson circus tent.</p> \n   <p>It sounds eccentric. But I\u2019d rather say idiosyncratic. Because \u2013 apart from the odd semi-mystical flourish about \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cthe wisdom of humility\u201d \u2013 Mr Stewart\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t dismissible as quirky or daft, an amusing little sideshow. It was serious. It showed intelligence, wit, maturity, and real feeling. It extolled such unfashionable conservative virtues as moderation, and the spirit of compromise, and economic prudence, and realism (\u201cI\u2019m a Conservative <em>because</em> I\u2019m a realist\u2026 I\u2019m a Conservative because I believe in prudence. In that, I\u2019m more of a Conservative than anybody in this race\u201d). And it elegantly dismantled what he called the \u201cfairy stories\u201d of both Jeremy Corbyn, and the leadership rivals who believe, or claim to believe, that a no-deal Brexit would be easy.</p> \n   <p>His way of answering questions marked him out from his rivals, too. He answers were direct, without the customary sneaky evasions; but they were also reflective, discursive, well structured, thought through. Not soundbites, but little off-the-cuff essays. More importantly than that, he didn\u2019t simply tell the person in the audience what he or she wanted to hear. <br></p> \n   <p>[...]<br></p> \n   <p>He declined, but respectfully, and without the usual spluttering clich\u00e9s about traitors and The Will of The People.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d00067c8f081a8ed1bb12cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T19:55:38.956Z\">8.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In other politics news, former Scottish National party MP <strong>Natalie McGarry</strong> has been released from custody pending a potential appeal, six days after she was sentenced to 18 months in prison for embezzling more than \u00a325,000 from pro-independence campaign groups.</p> \n  <p>Following her sentencing last week, a number of people questioned the merits of jailing an obviously vulnerable new mother, including one of the groups she stole from, Women for Independence, and Labour\u2019s Margaret Curran, who was shadow Scottish secretary until losing her seat to McGarry in the 2015 general election.</p> \n  <p>The 37-year-old was granted bail on Tuesday whilst judges decide whether she has legal grounds to appeal against the conviction or sentence.</p> \n  <p>The decision to grant bail was taken by Judge Lord Turnbull at a private hearing at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh, which McGarry did not attend.</p> \n  <p>Her legal team argued that McGarry had received \u201cdefective\u201d legal representation during previous sheriff court proceedings, that she suffers from poor mental health and does not pose a risk to public safety.</p> \n  <p>During a protracted legal process, McGarry changed counsel several times, then pleaded guilty in April but later refused to accept her own guilty plea.</p> \n  <p>She embezzled the largest amount, \u00a321,000, from Women for Independence (WfI) , a campaign group she helped set up and fulfilled the role of treasurer.

She said Gove sought to sell himself as someone with a broad electoral appeal, for example to floating Lib Dem voters, to women (he apparently stressed his strong voting record on equalities) and young people, due to his support for green issues as environment secretary.</p> \n  <p>There were, Morgan said, no questions about Gove\u2019s prior cocaine use, or as she delicately put it, \u201cany of the news at the weekend\u201d.</p> \n  <p>One question, from <strong>Philip Hammond</strong>, was to confirm with Gove that if he got to the final two he would not drop out before a vote of party members. Morgan said: \u201cHe said, \u2018100% I will do that \u2013 we cannot have another coronation, we\u2019ve got to have all the ideas tested.\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gove also talked up his Brexit plan \u2013 he is not dead-set on leaving on 31 October, come what may \u2013 and told MPs that pushing for no deal would most likely bring an election. \u201cHe said that whoever has not delivered Brexit, if we have a general election before we deliver Brexit, the Conservatives are not going to win,\u201d Morgan said.</p> \n  <p>Morgan also said Gove referred to Boris Johnson\u2019s bunker-based media strategy so far.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the things that Michael said is that when he was head of the Vote Leave campaign he did not shy away from fronting up to press scrutiny.

But they also debate other motions - sometimes making generalised statements about policy, and sometimes involving decisions about how the Commons orders its business (who sits on a committee, when a specific debate must end etc). The latter have a practical effect, but the former are not binding.</p> \n  <p>MPs have already this year passed amendments ruling out no-deal, like the Caroline Spelman/Jack Dromey one saying the Commons \u201crejects the United Kingdom leaving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a> without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship.\u201d But they were non-binding. They have no legal force, although they had some political weight.</p> \n  <p>Tomorrow Labour is not asking MPs to pass a general motion ruling out no deal. It is asking MPs to pass a business of the house motion that would set aside Tuesday 25 June for a debate, not on business chosen by the government, but to allow MPs to pass a Brexit-related bill chosen by the Speaker. This bill has not been published yet, but presumably it would be a cross-party one saying the PM would by law have to seek an extension to article 50 beyond 31 October if Britain is heading for a no-deal at that point.</p> \n  <p>This is the procedure used by backbenchers to pass the Yvette Cooper bill ordering the prime minister to seek an extension of article 50 in the spring.</p> \n  <p>What is different is that last time MPs managed to hijack the Commons timetable via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/25/mps-seize-control-of-brexit-process-by-backing-indicative-votes-amendment\">an amendment tabled by the Tory Sir Oliver Letwin</a> to a motion being debated as part of the procedure set up by the government in the event of its deal not being passed.

Sylvester said she had recently interviewed a chief constable who thought the Brexit process had led to an increase in hate crime.

One of the things that is striking is that since the referendum result attitudes towards migration in Britain have changed. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When Sylvester put it to him that hate crime had risen, Gove replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would contest that too. </p> \n   <p>Attitudes towards migration have changed. We are now the country in Europe with the most positive attitude towards migration. I remember talking to Ruth Davidson just before we were both speaking at the Scottish Conservative conference. And Ruth said to me: \u201cI\u2019m a remainer down to my boots, but the one thing I do have to grant, Michael, is that your argument is right. If people feel they have control over migration, then their attitude towards it becomes more relaxed and liberal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gove has made the argument about Britain becoming more pro-immigration since 2016 before, and there is evidence to back this up. People seem to worry about immigration less, and appreciate its benefits more. The UK also comes near the top in an EU survey asking if people are happy having an immigrant as a neighbour, although the government and the media are very anti-immigrant by EU standards.

She will hold talks later on Tuesday with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, as part of a trip during which she is pitching for an independent Scotland to join the EU.</p> \n  <p>As her visit was deemed to be about undermining the integrity of the UK, rather than her devolved responsibilities, Jeremy Hunt blocked the Foreign Office from offering any logistical support for the visit, the Daily Telegraph<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/11/jeremy-hunt-refuses-foreign-office-support-nicola-sturgeon-brussels/\"> reported</a>.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon played down the impact, saying it had not made \u201cany practical difference to us\u201d because the Scottish government had its own team in Brussels.

A narrow minority favour remaining in the UK, although support for independence has reached its highest point since 2015, with 49% for yes and 51% for no.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon said that was within the margin of error. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I readily accept we have to make the case and win the case for independence in a referendum. But when I look back to around 2012 when we were embarking on the campaign for the 2014 vote, support for independence was roughly at 30% and grew to 45%, so going into another referendum with 49%, is a position I relish.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>An independent Scotland would also face difficult questions over its future currency and border with the UK.<br></p> \n  <p>The first minister declined to say what would happen to the Scotland/UK border if Scotland joined the EU, while the UK was outside.

John Bercow has suggested he will not allow MPs to be pushed out of the Brexit process.</p> \n  <p>Asked how she would try and convince her fellow Brexiter Raab to be a feminist, Leadsom said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Fifty per cent of the world\u2019s population are women, and the other 50% are here because of women ...

We have got three more Conservative leadership candidates making formal campaign launches today, although all three are very much longshot candidates: Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Rory Stewart. But, first, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, who launched yesterday, has been doing interviews this morning giving details of his plan to deliver Brexit. An early Commons vote would be crucial, he told the Today programme.</p> \n  <p>Hancock said that he expected the new prime minister to be \u201ctested\u201d in the Commons in the final week of July. If he was Tory leader, he would hold a vote on <a href=\"https://www.letsmoveforward.co.uk/brexit\">his Brexit plan, </a>he said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The new prime minister is in place by 22 July. As prime minister I would propose to put my plan, which I have already published, to the House of Commons, in principle, immediately and therefore show the European Union that this plan is deliverable through the House of Commons.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s in principle. There\u2019s a whole load of legislation that needs to follow, but we need that once you have a majority in the House of Commons, things can move quickly. After all, the legislation to stop no-deal last time went through in a week.</p> \n   <p>Then I would negotiate with the European Union to get the time limit on the backstop. This isn\u2019t about reopening the whole withdrawal agreement. It\u2019s about putting a time limit on the backstop. The European Union have the opportunity on 16 October at the European council to agree to that addendum. It isn\u2019t reopening. It is simply turning the temporary nature [of the backstop] into a stated end stop. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock said getting the Commons to vote in favour of his plan would be crucial to unlocking an agreement from Brussels. When it was put to him that the EU would not accept limits to the backstop, he rejected this.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Not true. They have said that they are open to changes to the political declaration, which is about the future. And they nearly proposed a time limit on the backstop before but they didn\u2019t think that the prime minister, Theresa May, would be able to get it through the House of Commons.</p> \n   <p>This is why it is important to show that you can get it through the House of Commons in principle, and therefore open up the European Union to turning ... already their legal position is the backstop has to be temporary - what I am requesting of them is that they turn that into a longstop. And that is deliverable.</p> \n   <p>Do you know why? Go to motive. How do you successfully negotiate? You successfully negotiate by understanding the motives on the other side. And on the other side the motivation for us to leave by 31 October, so that Brexit doesn\u2019t in their view cast over into their new commission - that incentive is strong.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock has been <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/in-praise-of-matt-hancocks-brexit-plan/\">described as having the most realistic Brexit plan of all the more prominent candidates</a>, although that is quite a low bar. But readers will remember that a Commons vote in favour of the Brady amendment did not help Theresa May unlock a deal in Brussels. Later we may get some response from the EU, because Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, is speaking at a Politico Europe event.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>8.30am: </em>Theresa May chairs a political cabinet.

      "bodyText": "Do give my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s explainer on Labour\u2019s rebel motion tomorrow a read to be fully in the loop about its chances to derail a no-deal Brexit. I\u2019m going to wrap up now, goodnight. Michael Deacon from the Telegraph has just endorsed Rory Stewart. I\u2019ll let this sentence speak for itself. In a comment piece (paywalled), titled \u201cRory Stewart just gave a speech that blew his Tory leadership rivals out of the water\u201d, Deacon writes: Rory Stewart is different from the other Tory leadership contenders in just about every significant way. And just about every insignificant way, too. All the rest have launched their campaigns in the usual stuffy and soulless Westminster conference rooms. This evening, Mr Stewart launched his campaign in a crimson circus tent. It sounds eccentric. But I\u2019d rather say idiosyncratic. Because \u2013 apart from the odd semi-mystical flourish about \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cthe wisdom of humility\u201d \u2013 Mr Stewart\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t dismissible as quirky or daft, an amusing little sideshow. It was serious. It showed intelligence, wit, maturity, and real feeling. It extolled such unfashionable conservative virtues as moderation, and the spirit of compromise, and economic prudence, and realism (\u201cI\u2019m a Conservative because I\u2019m a realist\u2026 I\u2019m a Conservative because I believe in prudence. In that, I\u2019m more of a Conservative than anybody in this race\u201d). And it elegantly dismantled what he called the \u201cfairy stories\u201d of both Jeremy Corbyn, and the leadership rivals who believe, or claim to believe, that a no-deal Brexit would be easy. His way of answering questions marked him out from his rivals, too. He answers were direct, without the customary sneaky evasions; but they were also reflective, discursive, well structured, thought through. Not soundbites, but little off-the-cuff essays. More importantly than that, he didn\u2019t simply tell the person in the audience what he or she wanted to hear. [...] He declined, but respectfully, and without the usual spluttering clich\u00e9s about traitors and The Will of The People. In other politics news, former Scottish National party MP Natalie McGarry has been released from custody pending a potential appeal, six days after she was sentenced to 18 months in prison for embezzling more than \u00a325,000 from pro-independence campaign groups. Following her sentencing last week, a number of people questioned the merits of jailing an obviously vulnerable new mother, including one of the groups she stole from, Women for Independence, and Labour\u2019s Margaret Curran, who was shadow Scottish secretary until losing her seat to McGarry in the 2015 general election. The 37-year-old was granted bail on Tuesday whilst judges decide whether she has legal grounds to appeal against the conviction or sentence. The decision to grant bail was taken by Judge Lord Turnbull at a private hearing at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh, which McGarry did not attend. Her legal team argued that McGarry had received \u201cdefective\u201d legal representation during previous sheriff court proceedings, that she suffers from poor mental health and does not pose a risk to public safety. During a protracted legal process, McGarry changed counsel several times, then pleaded guilty in April but later refused to accept her own guilty plea. She embezzled the largest amount, \u00a321,000, from Women for Independence (WfI) , a campaign group she helped set up and fulfilled the role of treasurer. The money was intended to go to a food bank in Perth and Kinross and a campaign group, Positive Prisons, Positive Futures. She also admitted embezzling \u00a34,661 in the course of her role as treasurer, secretary and convener of the regional SNP association. Last week at Glasgow Sheriff Court, McGarry\u2019s lawyer detailed a catalogue of mental ill health starting before she entered parliament in 2015, including depression and anxiety as well as postpartum depression, which she experienced after the birth of her daughter in November 2017. Sheriff Paul Crozier told her that he had no option but to jail her, because her fraud was \u201cof the most serious kind,\u201d and relating to a position of trust. The NDA-story surrounding Dominic Raab is starting to make some waves on Twitter. This from Jack Sommers, head of news at the Jewish Chronicle: Boris Johnson\u2019s hide-and-seek of the past few days seems to keep working out for him. This from talkRadio\u2019s political editor Ross Kempsell: This just in from the Telegraph\u2019s Anna Mikhailova: My colleagues Rowena Mason and Poppy Noor are reporting that Boris Johnson will finally break his silence and face public scrutiny at his campaign launch event tomorrow. Read the full story here: The Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar is a lot more sceptical about the success of the Labour motion, and points out that many Tories who back it in principle could end up voting against it, just like Rory Stewart. Green MP Caroline Lucas spoke to Channel 4 about the way the motion might be done tomorrow. She said there is such anger and concern among MPs at the prospect of parliament being suspended, that rebel Tory MP\u2019s might be won over to back it. \u201cEssentially what we\u2019re seeking to do is to stop the prorogation of parliament, we\u2019re trying to stop whoever is the new prime minister from careering over the edge of a cliff, we\u2019re trying to get the steering wheel off them,\u201d Lucas said. Boris Johnson, currently the most likely next Prime Minister, is being accused of having recommended the sale of bomb parts to Saudi Arabia that were expected to be used in Yemen, shortly after dozens of civilians were killed in an airstrike. My colleague Dan Sabbagh reports, full story below: While Rory Stewart apparently won\u2019t be voting for Labour\u2019s motion, the former Conservative and now independent MP Nick Boles has just announced that he will jet back to London to do just that: The excitement about Rory Stewart refuses to ebb down for now. This from the New Statesman\u2019s editor-in-chief Jason Cowley: My colleague Rafael Behr has written a piece on the existential dilemma the Conservative party is facing, and echoes Tory leadership hopeful Sajid Javid\u2019s view that the party must come up with something beyond delivering Brexit. This is also very interesting from the Times\u2019 Iain Martin: Well, well, well... Rory Stewart seems to have back-paddled on what he said just over an hour ago. It really doesn\u2019t get boring. My colleague Jessica Elgot explains the planned Labour motion in more detail here: And here a bold prophecy from LBC Radio\u2019s James O\u2019Brien: My colleague Patrick Wintour on Rory Stewart\u2019s performance today: Earlier Steve Baker, the leading Tory Brexiteer and deputy chair of the European Research Group, put out this statement about his colleague, Tory MP Oliver Letwin, backing the Labour motion: Oliver Letwin brings closer a general election which could leave Conservatives holding as few as 26 seats. Colluding with this Labour leadership to deny Government control of the Commons business is unconscionable for being firmly against the national interest. My colleague Andrew Sparrow says it would be fair to assume that Baker feels the same about the prospect of Rory Stewart voting for Labour\u2019s motion. More praise for Rory Stewart, here from the FT\u2019s Sebastian Payne: And here Lewis Goodall from Sky with his view on Stewart: The Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, has warned MPs not to assume that because they have blocked Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, they will get a better one when a new prime minister is in place, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Varadkar said: I\u2019m a little bit concerned that some people in London seem to think that because the House of Common failed to ratify the agreement that that automatically means they are going to get a better one and that\u2019s a terrible political miscalculation and I hope that\u2019s not the one that\u2019s being made across the water. They made some miscalculations along the way, initially they thought that after the UK decided to leave that Ireland might fall into line, that we might leave too and we didn\u2019t and we are not. And some thought when push came to shove that Ireland would be abandoned that EU unity would break and they were wrong about that. And I really hope that they are not making a further political miscalculation. Twitter is still in fits about Rory Stewart\u2019s remarks regarding his willingness to back a Labour motion aimed at blocking no-deal. This from Labour MP Keir Starmer: One Robert Peston seems to be blown away by Stewart\u2019s launch. This just in from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. BuzzFeed News asked Dominic Raab if he would be willing to release a former female colleague from the confidentiality provisions she entered after one of his most high profile supporters, Maria Miller MP, told the BBC that the claims of bullying made against him were \u201cvexatious\u201d. From my colleague Jessica Elgot: This from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: Rory Stewart has just told the audience at his launch event that he is minded to back the Labour motion being debated tomorrow intended to allow MPs to rule out a no-deal Brexit. Asked about it, he said: A proposal is now being brought forward through legislation to try to take no-deal off the table, and I believe prorogation off the table. The first thing is, I am entirely against no-deal and entirely against prorogation. I haven\u2019t read the details of this. My instinct is I would be wholly supportive of a move that tried to do that. Why? Because no-deal is not a credible threat. Nobody can get no-deal through parliament because we, including me, will stop no-deal going through parliament. This is extraordinary. The government is likely to whip its MPs to vote against the Labour motion. If Stewart were to defy the whip and back it, or even abstain, he could be sacked - one day ahead of the first vote in the Tory leadership contest. Here is Michael Gove on the Labour motion being debate tomorrow. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking over now. Stewart says, if elected leader, he will walk through every county in the country, listening to people. He will use the energy he picks up to make the UK a better nation. And that\u2019s it. His opening speech is over. Back to the Rory Stewart launch, and Stewart has just been talking about how many trees he has planted. He is now talking about his father, a Scot who used to wear a kilt when he was working in Asia. He says he has been thinking of his father because they visited the D-day beaches together. Stewart says his father loved being in the army, but was furious with the officers at D-day. His father was a battle school instructor. He taught solidiers how to manoeuvre. But at D-day his commanding officer ignored this, and told soldiers to march nine-abreast. They were killed. He says the lesson his father learnt from this was that courage is in the space between cowardice and foolhardiness. (Stewart talks more about his father in the very interesting interview he gave to Nick Robinson\u2019s Political Thinking podcast. Stewart\u2019s father ended up deputy head of MI6.) Longshot candidate Mark Harper conducted his own post-hustings briefing, saying his message to MPs that Brexit on 31 October appeared very unlikely received \u201ca better reception than I thought\u201d. His message, Harper said, was that it was untenable for the party to again solemnly promise a departure date and then botch it: \u201cIf we get this wrong we\u2019re dead\u201d. Harper, who said he was was confident of getting the 16-plus backers needed to get past the first stage of voting, said Tory MPs were \u201cin a realistic frame of mind\u201d about Brexit, a view which promoted some polite scepticism from the assembled media. Stewart says public services are not good enough. When he sees an 88-year-old woman looking after a doubly-incontinent 92-year-old man, he knows it is not good enough. He would get every civil servant to have a sign on their desk saying, \u2018Would you be proud to put your mother or brother or sister in this hospital? And would you be proud to bring a visitor from abroad here?\u2019 Stewart says we are a serious country. That means being serious about defence, about security, about our parliament. We should challenge every country in the world to match our level of integrity and our level of seriousness. Stewart says he loves his country, and its diversity. He does not believe in promising what he cannot deliver, he says. There is no no-deal that we can push through parliament. And he does not believe in spending money the government does not have. He says the other candidates have already made spending promises worth \u00a380bn. Stewart says he will talk about the elephant in the room - the great prancing elephant - and he is not talking about Boris Johnson, he jokes. He says he is talking about negativism. No to the deal, no to parliament, no to everything. But democracy is founded on the word yes, he says. He says the other candidates are giving the voters \u201cfairy stories\u201d. Stewart accuses his leadership rivals of peddling \u201cfairy stories\u201d. The Conservative MP Gillian Keegan has just introduced Rory Stewart at his campaign launch. She says he has the life experience to be PM. Stewart says he has been travelling all over the country. And people tell him they want leadership, she says. People say it is a terrible time to be PM, he says. But the country faces a choice. On the one hand, there is populism. Stewart says he believes in people. He hates the fact the other side have taken the word populism. On the one side, there is a fairy story. And on the other there is realism. The civil service in Northern Ireland has published a paper (pdf) on what a no-deal Brexit would mean for the region, the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster reports. As he explains in a Twitter thread, the conclusions are sobering. Foster\u2019s thread starts here. And here is his conclusion. Here is the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith on the Stewart event. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, is about to start his campaign launch. It\u2019s a rally at the Underbank on the South Bank in London (a venue normally used for comedy). There is a live feed here. Here are two more questions from BTL about the Labour motion tomorrow that are worth answering. Any bill passed under this procedure would not just say that UK cannot leave the UK without a deal. That is because to a certain extent it is out of the government\u2019s hands. It is up to the EU to decide whether or not to agree a further extension. (The EU 27 have to agree unanimously.) Parliament cannot legislate for things that are impossible to guarantee - ie, the sun to shine on Sunday - or, at least it is not supposed to. Instead, the bill will probably be similar to the Yvette Cooper Act, which required the prime minister to hold a vote to give MPs the chance to order the PM to seek an article 50 extension. What\u2019s known as a humble address, or a motion for a return (of papers) is a specific, binding procedure used to force the government to publish certain papers. It is essentially a historic procedure that fell out of use for a long time, but which has been recently revived by Labour. There are other sorts of votes that are binding which are not humble address. This one would be binding because it would be a business of the house motion. Although the 1922 Committee hustings are taking place this afternoon, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby says another interview that took place behind closed doors last week may turn out to be as important in the Conservative leadership contest. A new poll for the pro-independence Progress Scotland has found a clear majority of Scots believe the timing and wording of a fresh independence referendum should be decided in Scotland, and not by the UK government. Progress Scotland, set up and run by the Scottish National party\u2019s former Westminster leader Angus Robertson, found 58% of voters felt the Scottish government should decide whether there should be a second referendum. Another 62% in the Survation poll felt the Scottish government should also decide on the question to be put. These results echo previous polls, but the survey, carried out last week, is timed to coincide with the Tory leadership contest and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s quest for a new referendum as soon as next year, on the back of Brexit. All the most prominent Tory leadership candidates have stated categorically they would refuse to give Holyrood the powers to stage a fresh vote, by transferring powers under section 30 of the Scotland Act, although Andrea Leadsom has not ruled it out. (See 3.19pm.) Under UK law, staging referendums is reserved to Westminster. The SNP hopes the fresh polling data will increase popular demands for the transfer of those powers, but the Survation poll did not actually ask voters whether they wanted section 30 powers to be handed over. A majority of Scottish voters do not want a second referendum in the near future, and support for independence remains below 50%. We\u2019ve also just been briefed on what Dominic Raab told MPs, by Nadhim Zahawi, a Raab backer. A seemingly new Raab pledge, we were told, was to deliver on the earlier Tory promise to extend the right of social tenants to buy their homes to housing association properties. On Brexit, Raab talked up his negotiating with the Council of Europe (not part of the EU) on denying UK prisoners a vote. Perhaps the most notable question to Raab was in fact an absence. Philip Hammond earlier asked both Gove and Hunt to promise they would stay in the race to the very end if they made the final two. But Zahawi said the chancellor did not ask Raab this, and was not even in the room for his pitch. We maybe know who Hammond believes has a realistic chance of facing Johnson in the vote of Tory members. These are from Joe Marshall, a specialist in parliament at the Institute for Government, on the Labour motion tomorrow designed to enable MPs to legislate to stop a no-deal Brexit in October. We\u2019ve also now been briefed about Jeremy Hunt\u2019s turn at the hustings, by backers Penny Mordaunt and Philip Dunne. Hunt talked up his promise to include the DUP and others to help renegotiate a Brexit deal, Dunne said, saying the foreign secretary emphasised his sensible approach and \u201cwent down very well\u201d with MPs. Mordaunt said Hunt talked up his unifying appeal, and was asked about the role in the world for a post-Brexit UK. In an apparent dig at Hunt\u2019s predecessor as foreign secretary, Mordaunt said: \u201cWhat sets Jeremy apart from other candidates is it\u2019s more jack, less bull.\u201d After a pause in which the assembled media nodded along politely, someone eventually asked what on earth this phrase actually means. \u201cJack as in Union Jack,\u201d Mordaunt replied. Presumably it means that Hunt would show more patriotism and less Johnson-esque bluster, but that\u2019s largely a guess. Jean-Claude Juncker has sunk the hopes of some of the runners in the Conservative leadership race over future Brexit negotiations with Brussels by ruling out a time-limit on the contentious Irish backstop. The European commission president insisted that the insurance arrangements designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland would need to last as long as that problem arose due to the UK\u2019s exit from the single market and customs union. Juncker said: There will be no renegotiations as far as the content of the withdrawal agreement is concerned. We can have some clarifications, precisions, additions to the political declaration. To avoid a hard border, the Irish backstop would keep the UK as a whole in a share customs territory preventing the country from developing an independent trade policy while Northern Ireland would stay under large swathes of EU law relating to the single market. Asked if that could mean a backstop time-limit, as suggested by the health secretary Matt Hancock among others, Juncker responded: \u201cNo\u201d. In his interview with Politico, Juncker went on: We\u2019ve concluded with Theresa May the withdrawal agreement. This isn\u2019t a treaty between May and Juncker, this is a treaty between the UK and the EU. It has to be respected by whomsoever will be the next British prime minister. Juncker would not be drawn into criticising the claims of some of the leadership contenders but he admitted that he \u201cdid not like what is happening\u201d in London. I have the impression for months now that the main interest for the British political society was how to replace Theresa May and not how to find an arrangement with the EU. I\u2019m currently lurking (the appropriate word) outside the latest Tory leadership hustings, organised by the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, where six hopefuls are being put through their paces this afternoon, with Michael Gove first. The door to the committee room is firmly shut, with a security officer stationed outside to stop the waiting media from jamming a foot in to keep it ajar. As such we can only really hear the occasional banging of desks (a sign of approval) and await briefings from supportive MPs. First out was Nicky Morgan, a Gove backer. She said Gove sought to sell himself as someone with a broad electoral appeal, for example to floating Lib Dem voters, to women (he apparently stressed his strong voting record on equalities) and young people, due to his support for green issues as environment secretary. There were, Morgan said, no questions about Gove\u2019s prior cocaine use, or as she delicately put it, \u201cany of the news at the weekend\u201d. One question, from Philip Hammond, was to confirm with Gove that if he got to the final two he would not drop out before a vote of party members. Morgan said: \u201cHe said, \u2018100% I will do that \u2013 we cannot have another coronation, we\u2019ve got to have all the ideas tested.\u2019\u201d Gove also talked up his Brexit plan \u2013 he is not dead-set on leaving on 31 October, come what may \u2013 and told MPs that pushing for no deal would most likely bring an election. \u201cHe said that whoever has not delivered Brexit, if we have a general election before we deliver Brexit, the Conservatives are not going to win,\u201d Morgan said. Morgan also said Gove referred to Boris Johnson\u2019s bunker-based media strategy so far. One of the things that Michael said is that when he was head of the Vote Leave campaign he did not shy away from fronting up to press scrutiny. We all know who;s not been seen very much by the press. Here is a question about the Labour motion that I suspect many people may be asking. It all depends on the status of what is being debated. MPs debate bills, laws which are binding when they are passed. But they also debate other motions - sometimes making generalised statements about policy, and sometimes involving decisions about how the Commons orders its business (who sits on a committee, when a specific debate must end etc). The latter have a practical effect, but the former are not binding. MPs have already this year passed amendments ruling out no-deal, like the Caroline Spelman/Jack Dromey one saying the Commons \u201crejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework for the future relationship.\u201d But they were non-binding. They have no legal force, although they had some political weight. Tomorrow Labour is not asking MPs to pass a general motion ruling out no deal. It is asking MPs to pass a business of the house motion that would set aside Tuesday 25 June for a debate, not on business chosen by the government, but to allow MPs to pass a Brexit-related bill chosen by the Speaker. This bill has not been published yet, but presumably it would be a cross-party one saying the PM would by law have to seek an extension to article 50 beyond 31 October if Britain is heading for a no-deal at that point. This is the procedure used by backbenchers to pass the Yvette Cooper bill ordering the prime minister to seek an extension of article 50 in the spring. What is different is that last time MPs managed to hijack the Commons timetable via an amendment tabled by the Tory Sir Oliver Letwin to a motion being debated as part of the procedure set up by the government in the event of its deal not being passed. This time an oppostion day motion is being used to hijack the Commons timetable. Nikki da Costa, who used to be head of legislative affairs at Downing Street for Theresa May, thinks it is unprecedented to use an opposition day in this way. Here is the text of the motion being debate tomorrow during the Labour opposition day debate. Business of the House Motion (United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union) (1) That, on Tuesday 25 June \u2013 (a) standing order no. 14(1) (which provides that government business shall have precedence at every sitting save as provided in that order) shall not apply; (b) precedence shall be given to a motion relating to the business of the house in connection with matters relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union; (c) if more than one motion relating to the business of the house is tabled, the Speaker shall decide which motion shall have precedence; (d) the Speaker shall interrupt proceedings on any business having precedence before the business of the house motion at 1.00 pm and call a member to move that motion; (e) debate on that motion may continue until 2.00 pm at which time the Speaker shall put the questions necessary to dispose of proceedings on that motion including the questions on amendments selected by the Speaker which may then be moved; (f) any proceedings interrupted or superseded by this order may be resumed or (as the case may be) entered upon and proceeded with after the moment of interruption. Labour get to draft the motion because the government has set aside tomorrow for a debate on an opposition motion. Labour gets a set number of such debates every session, but the government decides when they will be. But, in practice, this is a cross-party motion. As well as being signed by Jeremy Corbyn, it has also been signed by the SNP leader at Westminster Ian Blackford, the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster Liz Saville Roberts, the Tory MP Oliver Letwin, and the Green MP Caroline Lucas. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has just been asked about Brexit at his Politico Europe event. He said he had the highest respect for Britain. Without people like Churchill, the EU would not be as it is today, he said. But he said his \u201cbiggest regret\u201d was that he accepted David Cameron\u2019s advice not to intervene in the 2016 referendum campaign. That meant leave were free to tell lies. Q: Is this happening again? Juncker said Tory leadership candidates were free to say what they wanted. He did not like what was happening, he said. For months he has thought the main preoccupation of politicians in Britain was how to replace Theresa May, not how to deliver Brexit, he said. Juncker says British politicians have spent too much time considering how to replace Theresa May instead of how to deliver Brexit. He said the withdrawal agreement could not be changed. And there could be no changes to the backstop. Juncker says a new Tory leader will not get changes to the withdrawal agreement. Q: Do you have any favourites in the Tory leadership contest? After a long pause, Juncker said no. Q: So if Boris Johnson becomes Tory leader, you will have to step up no-deal planning? Juncker replied: The withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated. Q: Will Brexit ever happen? Juncker said the questioner was looking for a headline. His working assumption was that the UK would leave, he said. This is from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, commenting on the Labour vote tomorrow designed to allow MPs to pass legislation ruling out no-deal. The debate on Brexit in the Tory leadership contest has descended into the disturbing, the ludicrous and the reckless. None of the likely candidates for the top job has a credible plan for how to break the deadlock before the end of October. Instead, we have witnessed candidates openly advocating a damaging no deal Brexit and even proposing dragging the Queen into politics by asking her to shut down parliament to achieve this. MPs cannot be bystanders while the next Tory prime minister tries to crash the UK out of the European Union without a deal and without the consent of the British people. That\u2019s why we are taking this latest measure to end the uncertainty and protect communities across the country. My challenge to MPs who disagree either with a no deal Brexit or proroguing parliament is to back this motion and act in the national interest. Labour has announced that it will hold a vote tomorrow on what it says is a binding motion that would allow time for MPs to pass a law to rule out a no-deal Brexit in October. Here is how the party explains it in a press release. Labour and a cross-party alliance will tomorrow force a Commons vote to allow MPs to seize control of the parliamentary agenda and introduce legislation to prevent the next Tory prime minister pursuing a no-deal Brexit later this year. The motion will allow MPs to take control of the House of Commons agenda on Tuesday 25 June. MPs will then have the chance to introduce legislation that could help avoid the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. The motion will use the same procedure that was used earlier this year to block a no-deal Brexit in March. Unlike typical opposition day debates, the motion, if passed, will be binding. The intervention comes as a no-deal Brexit has become the key dividing line in the Tory leadership contest. Several of the leading candidates have advocated a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. However, senior cabinet ministers \u2013 including the prime minister, the chancellor and the work and pensions secretary \u2013 have opposed a no deal being implemented without the consent of parliament. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has more on what happened at cabinet this morning. And this is from the Telegraph\u2019s Steven Swinford. The 1922 Committee leadership hustings have just started. They are in a Commons committee room, and journalists are not allowed in. Here are some tweets from reporters outside the door. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar on the Tory leadership contest. At her press gallery lunch Andrea Leadsom, the Tory leadership candidate and former leader of the Commons, said she would not rule out allowing a second Scottish independence referendum. She explained: The reason I say \u2018never say never\u2019 is because I do not think that there should be another independence referendum in Scotland, I do not think it\u2019s in their interest, but on the other hand I am a big believer in devolution. So, what I just want to say is I am not going to stand here and utterly rule it out because I think that that is disrespectful. But I would very strongly fight against a second referendum, which I don\u2019t think is in the interest of Scotland and it\u2019s definitely not in the interests of the UK. What I think we have to be doing is promote the strength of the UK working together far stronger, far more than we have done and I have a number of policy areas that I would use to try and make that happen. Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, was speaking at a press gallery lunch this afternoon. She seems to have found a new slogan for her leadership campaign. This is from the Suns\u2019 Matt Dathan. According to my colleague Rowena Mason, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said at cabinet this morning that he needed an extra \u00a31bn for no-deal planning. Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now Facebook\u2019s head of global affairs, also spoke at the Times CEO summit. He told the event he thought the chances of a no-deal Brexit were increasing: I think the chances of a no-deal outcome have accelerated because the Conservative party, as they always do, have put their own survival ahead of the survival of the union of the United Kingdom. And they decided that delivering Brexit, however that economically impacts today, is absolutely imperative for their survival. Michael Gove, the environment secretary and Tory leadership candidate, has rejected claims that the Brexit vote has led to an increase in hate crime - even though a Home Office report says it did. He was speaking at the Times CEO event, where he was asked by the Times columnist Rachel Sylvester if he was ashamed of the anti-immigration tone adopted by the Vote Leave campaign that he ran in 2016 with Boris Johnson. Sylvester said she had recently interviewed a chief constable who thought the Brexit process had led to an increase in hate crime. Gove replied: I would disagree with that. One of the things that is striking is that since the referendum result attitudes towards migration in Britain have changed. When Sylvester put it to him that hate crime had risen, Gove replied: I would contest that too. Attitudes towards migration have changed. We are now the country in Europe with the most positive attitude towards migration. I remember talking to Ruth Davidson just before we were both speaking at the Scottish Conservative conference. And Ruth said to me: \u201cI\u2019m a remainer down to my boots, but the one thing I do have to grant, Michael, is that your argument is right. If people feel they have control over migration, then their attitude towards it becomes more relaxed and liberal. Gove has made the argument about Britain becoming more pro-immigration since 2016 before, and there is evidence to back this up. People seem to worry about immigration less, and appreciate its benefits more. The UK also comes near the top in an EU survey asking if people are happy having an immigrant as a neighbour, although the government and the media are very anti-immigrant by EU standards. See here and here for all the details. But his claim about Brexit and hate crime flies in the face of official evidence. A Home Office report on hate crime (pdf) published in October 2017 said: The increase [in police recorded hate crime] over the last year is thought to reflect both a genuine rise in hate crime around the time of the EU referendum and also due to ongoing improvements in crime recording by the police. In 2018, when another set of crime figures was published, the Home Office also said that there were \u201cspikes in hate crime following certain events such as the EU referendum\u201d. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary has also said there is a link between Brexit and hate crime. Dee Collins, who was recently interviewed by Sylvester before retiring as chief constable of West Yorkshire police, also insisted there was a link. \u201cBrexit has enabled some people to feel able to behave and say things in a particular way. So I think there is a real nervousness in the Muslim community and indeed other communities about faith-based hate crime,\u201d Collins told the Times (\u00a3). At the Times CEO event Gove was asked if he was proud of the way he ran the Vote Leave campaign. He defended it strongly, saying: You are always run any campaign better. I could certainly have run aspects of past leadership campaigns better. But the argument that we made was that our migration policy should be based not on an arbitrary target, \u201ctens of thousands\u201d, but on what was right for our economy, and that simply because somebody happened to be a citizen of Bulgaria rather than Bangladesh, that should not mean that they should automatically have an advantage. In the past, when asked the same question, Gove has been more willing to concede that he was not entirely happy with the way the campaign stoked fears about Turkish immigration. Nicola Sturgeon has accused the UK government of undermining Scotland\u2019s interests by refusing to allow the Foreign Office to support her trip to Brussels. Scotland\u2019s first minister is in the Belgian capital, where she met the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. She will hold talks later on Tuesday with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, as part of a trip during which she is pitching for an independent Scotland to join the EU. As her visit was deemed to be about undermining the integrity of the UK, rather than her devolved responsibilities, Jeremy Hunt blocked the Foreign Office from offering any logistical support for the visit, the Daily Telegraph reported. Sturgeon played down the impact, saying it had not made \u201cany practical difference to us\u201d because the Scottish government had its own team in Brussels. She said: If there is a serious aspect to this it is another example of the UK government trying to undermine a devolved government\u2019s efforts trying to protect the interests of our country. She also suggested that Hunt - one of the frontrunners in the Tory leadership race - was probably \u201cplaying to the audience of Tory party members\u201d. Speaking to an audience at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, she contrasted the EU\u2019s solidarity with Ireland with the UK government\u2019s attitudes to devolved administrations on Brexit, claiming Edinburgh had been ignored - a view echoed in Cardiff. Her speech set out the case for an independent Scotland to join the EU. The Scottish government will exert a positive influence wherever we can in the wider debate about UK membership, but in the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity we also desire the option of taking our own place in Europe. Sturgeon spoke warmly about the EU as a peace project and vehicle for cooperation on the climate crisis, but she did not hide her criticism of some policies, including the common fisheries policy, which is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishing communities. A recent YouGov poll showed that a majority of Scots are opposed to another Scottish independence referendum in the next five years. A narrow minority favour remaining in the UK, although support for independence has reached its highest point since 2015, with 49% for yes and 51% for no. Sturgeon said that was within the margin of error. I readily accept we have to make the case and win the case for independence in a referendum. But when I look back to around 2012 when we were embarking on the campaign for the 2014 vote, support for independence was roughly at 30% and grew to 45%, so going into another referendum with 49%, is a position I relish. An independent Scotland would also face difficult questions over its future currency and border with the UK. The first minister declined to say what would happen to the Scotland/UK border if Scotland joined the EU, while the UK was outside. She said Scotland \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to choose between the two\u201d, adding that it would also depend on the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Esther McVey has challenged other candidates in the contest to be the next Tory leader to join her in committing to restoring free TV-licenses for the over 75s. Criticising the BBC, she said she was ashamed of its decision to make most over 75s pay. But she did not commit government funding to reverse the decision, instead suggesting that the BBC should cut back on other services to provide them. She said: The BBC was told that it could increase the licence fee if it covered free TV licences for over 75s. It now seems to have broken the terms of that deal and millions of pensioners will have to pay for their licences. My aim is to make sure that the BBC do not benefit financially from breaking their promise and I would want to do everything we can to ensure that all over 75s get the free TV licences they deserve. This topic could be important for the leadership hopefuls, given that 69% of people over 70 are thought to vote Tory. Q: You say it would be crazy to walk away from the EU if, by 31 October, you were close to a deal. What would that look like? Gove says that would involve changes to the political declaration, and changes to the backstop. And that\u2019s it. The Gove event is over. Sylvester has now opened it up to questions from the audience. Q: What makes you think a majority of the country still want to leave? Gove says he thinks that is what polling shows. Some leavers have changed their mind, but there are remainers who accept that Brexit has to be delivered. Q: But young people don\u2019t want to leave, and more and more of them are turning 18 the longer this goes on. Gove says some young people were passionately in favour of leaving. He says no one defends the common agricultural policy. He says his approach to reforming the CAP has been widely backed. Q: Will you stay in this race? Is it to prove something to your parents? Gove says he owes a huge amount to his parents, but that he is in the contest because he has worked with two different PMs and he thinks he has the experience to deliver. Q: You are not going to give up? No, he says. Q: Do you still think Johnson is an election winner for the Tories? He seems to have lost the remain vote. Gove says he thinks people look afresh at someone when they become prime minister. A new PM will be given the chance to prove themselves, he says. Q: Is Johnson the candidate most likely to win a general election? Gove says he has been watching the new documentary series about Margaret Thatcher. It was said she was too divisive to win an election, and that she was too interested in ideas. But she won elections. He says he thinks electability is more complex than people think. Q: Is she your heroine? Gove says Teddy Roosevelt is more of a hero for him. Roosevelt recognised that you need to reform capitalism to save it. Q: Have you been surprised by the backlash there has been against you over drugs? John McDonnell told the Times CEO summit this morning he could not afford to take drugs when he was young, but you did not have a privileged background either. Gove says there are good arguments about how to approach drugs policy, but those arguments do not apply to what individuals do. Q: Why did you succumb to frailty and take drugs? Did you want to be part of a gilded elite? No, says Gove. He says he thinks he had a privileged background. He was loved as a child. Q: Do voters care about this? Gove says he thinks people look at politicians in the round. He says he thinks he has shown in office that he can deliver. Q: Are there issues about Boris Johnson\u2019s private life? No, says Gove. He says he thinks Johnson should just be judged on the issues. Gove criticises Boris Johnson\u2019s tax plans. He says there should be two tests for potential tax cuts: do they power growth, and do they help the least well off in society? He says a tax cut that would help the wealthiest pensioners most of all would not achieve either of these two aims. I think that there are two tests that I would apply to any tax cut. Does it par economic growth and does it help the most disadvantaged in our society? A tax cut that concentrates on helping the wealthiest pensioners most of all is not a tax cut which either improves productivity or generates a greater level of social equity. Q: In 2016 you said Boris Johnson was incapable of being a good PM. Have you changed your mind? Yes, says Gove. He says all the candidates are good. Q: Do you think he has the attention to detail to be a good PM? We will find out in this campaign, he says. Gove says there is no polling evidence to suggest the Tories could win a general election without having delivered Brexit. Q: Would you ever do a deal with Nigel Farage? No, says Gove. Q: Why not? Gove says he is a Conservative. Farage leads a different party. They have a different approach. Q: I spoke to a police officer recently who said that the Brexit campaign had led to an increase in hate crimes. Do you regret the way you ran the 2016 referendum campaign. No, says Gove. He says Britons have become more pro-immigrant since the campaign. Q: But hate crime has gone up. Gove says he does not accept that. He says Ruth Davidson, a remainer, says the leave campaign was right in the arguments it made about immigration. Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, is speaking at the Times CEO summit. He is being interviewed by the Times columnist Rachel Sylvester. Q: Did you underestimate how complicated Brexit would be? Gove says he always knew leaving the EU would be complicated, and he was opposed to rushing the decision to trigger article 50. That decision was taken when he was not in government. Jeremy Corbyn said article 50 should be triggered immediately, he says. Q: The civil service analysis of a no-deal Brexit is hair-raising. Is Mark Sedwill, the cabinet office secretary - who set out his warnings here - wrong? Or are the Brexiters wrong to say it will be fine? Gove says it is the job of the civil service to warn about potential dangers. No-deal would be difficult, but the government could get through it, he says. Here are the main points from Mark Harper\u2019s campaign launch. Harper, a former chief whip, said that leaving the EU with a deal - which is what he wants to achieve - would not be possible by 31 October. (See 10.44am.) He is the only candidate saying this. All the others think the UK could leave by 31 October with a deal, or don\u2019t care about getting a new deal. But Harper did also say the UK had to leave the EU before the local elections next year. (See 10.46am.) He said Boris Johnson and all other candidates should answer fully any questions about past drug use. He had not taken illegal drugs himself, he said. (See 11.11am.) I have never taken any illegal drugs in my life. I don\u2019t get invited to those sorts of parties. He criticised Johnson for proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. (See 10.51am.) He said that he was the only candidate not involved in the \u201cfailed decisions\u201d of the last three years because he did not serve in government under Theresa May. (See 11.09am.) He said that if the government lost a no-confidence vote, Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister ahead of the subsequent general election. (See 10.59am.) Harper made a point of taking questions until the journalists ran out of things to ask. That meant there was time for something rather bizarre at the end. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has launched a campaign video this morning. Like Jeremy Hunt in a video last week, Javid has gone for the John Major approach - filming his return to the very modest home where he grew up in Bristol (although Hunt, whose upbringing was privileged, returned to the garage where he set up his first business). The film, which features Javid\u2019s family prominently, is watchable and engaging and very successfully makes the point that Javid comes from a background unlike anyone else\u2019s in the leadership contest. \u201cThe three things that have helped me get where I am today are public services, hard work and the encouragement and support of my family,\u201d he says. The video does, though, rather gloss over one aspect of Javid\u2019s career. He was a banker, head of head of global credit trading at Deutsche Bank, where he was involved in trading collateralised debt obligations [CDOs] and other high-risk products of the kind that were ultimately implicated in financial crash. In the video Javid does not mention banking, but he says instead he worked in \u201cinternational business doing multi-billion dollar deals helping growing economies\u201d. (He worked in emerging markets.) The video is getting a lot of praise. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. And this is from Charlie Beckett, a media professor. But the Economist\u2019s Anne McElvoy has her doubts. And this is from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Mike Bird. Andrea Leadsom has insisted parliament would be unable to block a no-deal Brexit, and the 31 October deadline is a \u201chard red line\u201d for her. At a relaxed launch event in Westminster, Leadsom, who resigned as leader of the Commons last month, claimed her plans for a managed Brexit would be likely to win over both MPs and the EU27 - but even if MPs objected, they would not be able to force the government to extend article 50. While MPs forced May\u2019s hand in March to ask for an extension, Leadsom said \u201cthat would not be the case in the situation of a managed exit\u201d: I do not think that parliament actually has the ability to prevent us leaving at the end of October. Leadsom has struggled to make headway in the leadership contest, with many senior Brexiters backing either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab. She said she was offering herself as \u201can optimistic, yet realistic Brexiteer.\u201d She also insisted she would not pull out until she has to. Of all the candidates, I am the one that will not be withdrawing, under any circumstances. I think we\u2019ve tested that for destruction over the last three years. Asked to reflect on the contest in 2016, when she ran against Theresa May, but withdrew after telling a journalist she felt she would make a better prime minister because she had children, Leadsom said she had learned never to say \u201cas a mother\u201d. Leadsom\u2019s slogan is Decisive &amp; Compassionate Leadership, emblazoned on a pale blue background. She highlighted a series of domestic priorities she would like to focus on aside from Brexit, with a particular focus on childcare and the \u201cfirst 1,000 days\u201d of a child\u2019s life, including restoring Sure Start centres and family centres, and piloting a scheme to provide meals to the poorest children in school holidays. Leadsom said staying in May\u2019s cabinet had been uncomfortable at times, but that her record as leader of the Commons showed she could get things done, including, if necessary, by \u201ctackling Mr Speaker\u201d. John Bercow has suggested he will not allow MPs to be pushed out of the Brexit process. Asked how she would try and convince her fellow Brexiter Raab to be a feminist, Leadsom said: Fifty per cent of the world\u2019s population are women, and the other 50% are here because of women ... What\u2019s not to like about femiinsm? It makes its own argument. She also repeated the argument that Boris Johnson\u2019s policy for a \u00a310bn tax handout to higher earners would be impossible to get through a hung parliament. Michael Gove, the environment secretary and one of the more prominent Tory leadership candidates, will be speaking later at a Times CEO leadership summit, at around 12pm. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is due to speak too. Harper has now finished. I will post a summary soon. In the operational note sent to journalists ahead of this press conference, Mark Harper described it as an \u201cask me anything\u201d event. He said he would take questions, which he would actually answer. That is why it is going on for so long. Harper wants to keep going until the questions dry up. Harper defends the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. He says one of the criticisms of British politics is that there is too much short-term thinking. Saying parliaments should last five years was one way of addressing this, he says. Harper admits that he has not discussed his plan with EU leaders. But he says candidates who are doing a lot of \u201cname dropping\u201d need to explain why the Brexit plan they claim to have has not been implemented. He is referring in particular to Jeremy Hunt, who says that he has discussed Brexit with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and that he believes there is a willingness in the EU to strike a deal. Harper says there are some MPs who are supporting him who have not declared in public yet. Q: Do you think Boris Johnson needs to explain what his actual experience of drug use is? Harper says all the candidates need to be honest. He has not taken illegal drugs, he says. He was not brought up in that sort of background, and he does not get invited to those sorts of parties. He says candidates have to answer these questions now, because a party leader will get asked these questions in an election campaign. Harper says Boris Johnson and all other candidates must answer fully any questions about their past drug use. Q: You are the lowest profile candidate in this race? Will this be a disadvantage if you become PM? Harper says, as chief whip, he had to take his colleagues with him. And, as immigration minister, he had to deal with foreign colleagues. He accepts that he does not have as much experience as his rivals in the contest. But they were all involved in the \u201cfailed decisions\u201d of the last three years. The primary responsibility for what happened is with the prime minister. But that responsibility is shared with her cabinet colleagues, he says. Harper says it is \u201cessential\u201d that any candidates in the race take part in debates. Harper says it was a mistake for Theresa May to think that she could do a deal with Jeremy Corbyn. He is \u201cnot a man you could do business with\u201d. But there are a lot of very decent Labour MPs, he says. Harper says he is the only candidate in the race who had to win back a seat from Labour. When he was selected as a candidate for Forest of Dean, Labour had a majority there of more than 6,000. Now he has a majority of almost 10,000. Harper says the UK has not done a good job of showing the EU \u201cwhat we bring the party\u2019 and what a future relationship with the EU would look like. Q: What will happen if a no-deal Brexit leads to a vote of no confidence in the government? Harper says he took the Fixed-terms Parliament Act through the Commons. No one is quite sure what would happen in the 14-day period after a no confidence vote, he says. But he says it is possible that Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister, and that Corbyn could subsequently lead a government into a general election. Harper says it is not reasonable for the EU to ask the UK to sign a treaty including a backstop that has no end. The withdrawal agreement, with an open-ended backstop, will not get through parliament, he says. Harper says he accepts he is the underdog. But, as chief whip, he helped deliver the government\u2019s programme during the coalition government even though it had a small majority after 2015. He says people may not have heard of him. But he thinks chief whips who are successful do not attract publicity. He says he comes from a working class background. But he is the only person in the contest who got to Oxford from a comprehensive school. Harper is now taking questions. Q: How will you get the EU to renegotiate the backstop when they have ruled this out? Harper says he thinks there is a \u201clanding zone\u201d to get a deal. But \u201crushing headlong towards 31 October is not a credible plan\u201d, he says. He says some of the other candidates have set out the wrong choices. He wants tax cuts, he says. But he wants to focus those tax cuts on people at the lower end of the income spectrum. Offering tax cuts to high earners is wrong, he says. Harper criticises Boris Johnson for proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Harper says tax cuts would not get through parliament either. Making promises that cannot be kept is a mistake, he says. He says the problem with Brexit is that Theresa May repeatedly promised that Brexit would happen by March, and then it didn\u2019t. He says breaking promises would \u201cput rocket boosters under Nigel Farage\u201d. Harper says he would insist on proper collective cabinet responsibility. He is opposed to ministers briefing from cabinet, he says. Harper says the Tories cannot go back to any more elections until the UK has left the EU. There are elections next year, he says, referring to the local elections. The UK will have to have left by then, he says. Harper says he would insist on UK leaving EU before local elections next year. Harper says the UK is leaving the EU, but it is not leaving Europe. Britain needs to show it remains committed to a relationship with Europe. He says the government must show the EU that a deal including a backstop will not get through parliament. He says, when they accept that, they will budge. He says it will not be possible to leave on 31 October. He regrets that, he says. He voted to leave, and voted against an extension. But it is not credible to argue that you can conclude a new negotiation by the end of October, he says. Harper says leaving EU by 31 October will not be possible. Mark Harper, the former Tory chief whip, is launching his leadership campaign. He claims he is the only candidate with a credible and realistic Brexit plan. He says he is comfortable with leaving without a deal. But his preference is to leave with a deal, he says. He says all the other candidates were implicated in the government\u2019s approach. But he has been out of government since Brexit, and so he is not implicated, he says. He says there is a narrow landing zone. The government will have to agree a deal that has Tory and DUP approval, and the backing of a handful, or two handfuls, of MPs. He says the deal is not going to pass by a large majority; it would be more like a majority of 10, he says. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon is in Brussels this morning for meetings with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier after making a speech at the European Policy Centre in which she will insists that the people of Scotland have \u201cshown that they comprehensively reject Brexit and want to remain as a European nation\u201d according to their voting in the recent EU elections. The Telegraph reports this morning that Jeremy Hunt has refused to provide Foreign Office support for Sturgeon\u2019s visit, because of concerns that she will be using to trip to promote Scottish independence. Scottish government sources this morning have downplayed the story, suggesting it has more to do with Hunt\u2019s Tory leadership bid and pointing out that they have their own officials in Brussels to facilitate meetings. Regardless, the manner in which Sturgeon is received in Brussels will be interesting to note: it is certainly the case that, since the UK\u2019s referendum, the tone in which Scotland - and the prospect of Scottish independence and subsequent re-joining of the EU \u2013 has softened. Significantly, the Spanish government has said it would not veto a fresh application from an independent Scotland \u2013 it was adamantly against it during the 2014 independence referendum, no doubt with an eye to its own internal tensions over Catalonia. Sturgeon herself is known to be highly respected for her stance since the referendum. Q: What would you say to persuade Dominic Raab to call himself a feminist? Leadsom says 50% of the world are women. And the other 50% are only here because of women. She does not see why anyone would not call themselves a feminist. What\u2019s not to like? And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What lessons did you learn from your unsuccessful run in 2016? Leadsom says she did not see it as unsuccessful. She came second. If she makes it into the final two this time, she definitely will not withdraw. As for lessons, she says she has learnt to stay positive, to put the country first and to never say \u201cas a mother\u201d. Q: You wil need at least 16 MPs backing you to get beyond the first found of voting. If you only have 16 MPs, will you back out? Leadsom says, of all the candidates, she is the one who will not be withdrawing in any circumstances. Leadsom says she is not proposing a no-deal Brexit. She is proposing a managed no-deal. But planning for no-deal, the government can minimise disruption, she says. Q: A lot of the Brexiters who backed you in 2016 are not supporting you now. So why should people back your campaign? Leadsom says she is a candidate with a workable plan. Leadsom is now taking questions. Q: Would you cut taxes? Leadsom says the government already has a series of statutory instruments on the books that it cannot get through the Commons because they would raise charges. So tax reform is not possible in this parliament, she says. She says she is a low-tax Tory, but tax changes would have to wait until after a general election, she says. Leadsom says her ambition if for everyone in \u201cour great country\u201d being able to fulfil their potential. She says she is offering herself as an optimistic but realistic Brexiter, with a range of transformative policy ideas. Leadsom says she went to a state grammar school. The head had high expectations of the girls. Her ambition to become an MP was encouraged by the school. She organised a debate on the importance of the nuclear deterrent. Leadsom says she worked in finance for 25 years. That taught her that you can find the very best and the very worst in capitalism. She saw how reckless borrowing led to the financial crisis. This gave her the realism and cynicism that taught her the need for regulation. Leadsom says she wants to explain who she is. Whens she was four, her parents divorced. For the next four years her mum brought up her alone. She says there was no help for single parents then. That taught her how important state help can be. Leadsom says she would appoint a police chief to address the knife crime problem, reporting directly to the home secretary. She says more money for schools and policing would be her top priorities in the spending review. Leadsom says recognising the \u201cclimate emergency\u201d would be a priority for her. As PM, she would set up a unit to chart a path towards a zero-carbon future. She says she wants more people to be able to keep more of their income. On housing, she says she wants to tackle high rents, and enable an \u201cexplosion\u201d of self-build homes. She says she would set up a cross-party commission to come up with proposals on social care, to take the party politics out of this issue. She says families need more support. There would be more help in the first 1,000 days. And she would pilot the local provision of holiday meals for children who go hungry during the school holidays. Leadsom says our democracy underpins faith in politics. So we have to restore faith in democracy, she says. She says extraordinary opportunities are opening up to people. To unite the country, we need to show a compassionate vision, and play a leading role on the world stage. Andrea Leadsom is speaking at her leadership launch now. She says the UK has a bright future outside the EU. It needs a leader who is decisive, but compassionate, she says. She says leaving by 31 October is, for her, a \u201chard red line\u201d. Other issues have not received the attention they deserve because of Brexit, she says. It was uncomfortable at times, she says. But she stayed because she thought it was the right thing to do. And she was able to get things done as leader of the Commons - addressing bullying, Palace of Westminster restoration, and tackling John Bercow, the Commons Speaker. (Eh? It is not clear what Leadsom is referring to. She has had plenty of rows with Bercow, but done nothing to constrain his power, which he is exercising more pro-actively than any Speaker in modern times.) More from the Leadsom launch. Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter former Commons leader, does not seem to be expecting a huge crowd at her launch, PoliticsHome\u2019s John Johnston reports. Good morning. We have got three more Conservative leadership candidates making formal campaign launches today, although all three are very much longshot candidates: Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Rory Stewart. But, first, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who launched yesterday, has been doing interviews this morning giving details of his plan to deliver Brexit. An early Commons vote would be crucial, he told the Today programme. Hancock said that he expected the new prime minister to be \u201ctested\u201d in the Commons in the final week of July. If he was Tory leader, he would hold a vote on his Brexit plan, he said. The new prime minister is in place by 22 July. As prime minister I would propose to put my plan, which I have already published, to the House of Commons, in principle, immediately and therefore show the European Union that this plan is deliverable through the House of Commons. That\u2019s in principle. There\u2019s a whole load of legislation that needs to follow, but we need that once you have a majority in the House of Commons, things can move quickly. After all, the legislation to stop no-deal last time went through in a week. Then I would negotiate with the European Union to get the time limit on the backstop. This isn\u2019t about reopening the whole withdrawal agreement. It\u2019s about putting a time limit on the backstop. The European Union have the opportunity on 16 October at the European council to agree to that addendum. It isn\u2019t reopening. It is simply turning the temporary nature [of the backstop] into a stated end stop. Hancock said getting the Commons to vote in favour of his plan would be crucial to unlocking an agreement from Brussels. When it was put to him that the EU would not accept limits to the backstop, he rejected this. Not true. They have said that they are open to changes to the political declaration, which is about the future. And they nearly proposed a time limit on the backstop before but they didn\u2019t think that the prime minister, Theresa May, would be able to get it through the House of Commons. This is why it is important to show that you can get it through the House of Commons in principle, and therefore open up the European Union to turning ... already their legal position is the backstop has to be temporary - what I am requesting of them is that they turn that into a longstop. And that is deliverable. Do you know why? Go to motive. How do you successfully negotiate? You successfully negotiate by understanding the motives on the other side. And on the other side the motivation for us to leave by 31 October, so that Brexit doesn\u2019t in their view cast over into their new commission - that incentive is strong. Hancock has been described as having the most realistic Brexit plan of all the more prominent candidates, although that is quite a low bar. But readers will remember that a Commons vote in favour of the Brady amendment did not help Theresa May unlock a deal in Brussels. Later we may get some response from the EU, because Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, is speaking at a Politico Europe event. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Theresa May chairs a political cabinet. At 9.30am there will be a normal cabinet meeting. 9.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the former Commons leader, launches her leadership campaign. 10.30am: Mark Harper launches his campaign. 3pm: The Conservative 1922 Committee holds its first hustings, in private. The candidates speaking today are, in order: Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab, Harper, Leadsom and Sajid Javid. 3pm: Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, speaks at a live event with Politico Europe\u2019s Florian Eder. There is a live stream here. 5.30pm: Rory Stewart launches his campaign at a rally. Also, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is in Brussels today where she is meeting EU leaders and giving a speech. And Jeremy Corbyn is chairing a meeting of the shadow cabinet. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s justice minister is facing growing calls to resign after a series of politically explosive leaks that some observers believe could have a profound effect on Brazilian politics and the administration of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. S\u00e9rgio Moro became an A-list celebrity in Brazil for leading the historic \u201cCar Wash\u201d anti-corruption investigation. He controversially took his job last year after helping jail Bolsonaro\u2019s key election rival, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and has been widely tipped as a future president himself. But Moro\u2019s political future was thrown into doubt on Sunday after the Intercept began publishing a series of expos\u00e9s based on what it called \u201ca vast trove\u201d of secret documents provided by an anonymous source. The Intercept said its \u201cSecret Brazil Archive\u201d reports \u2013 which contained compromising excerpts from mobile phone chats between Moro and Car Wash prosecutors \u2013 showed he had engaged in \u201cimproper and unethical plotting\u201d designed to ensure Lula\u2019s imprisonment. Lula was prevented from taking part in last year\u2019s presidential election \u2013 which polls suggested he would have won \u2013 after being convicted of bribe taking and corruption by Moro in 2017. He is currently serving an almost nine-year sentence in southern Brazil. Moro has rejected accusations of wrongdoing as \u201csensationalist\u201d smears and his supporters branded the leaks a criminal conspiracy designed to undermine the former judge and Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. But on Tuesday \u2013 as Brazilian politicians braced for further revelations promised by the Intercept - there were calls for Moro\u2019s removal. \u201cMoro has to go,\u201d said Guilherme Boulos, a left-wing leader some see as a potential heir to Lula. \u201cThere is now compelling evidence of his involvement in illegal and unethical practices \u2026 Moro no longer has the political or moral capacity to run the justice ministry.\u201d The conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper said it believed Moro should resign. The Intercept\u2019s leaks revealed \u201ca totally inappropriate \u2013 and possibly illegal \u2013 relationship\u201d between Moro and prosecutors \u201cwith legal and political implications that are still hard to gauge\u201d, the newspaper said in a scathing editorial. \u201cOther ministers have been sacked for far less,\u201d it pointed out. Jos\u00e9 Roberto de Toledo, a political journalist from the magazine Piau\u00ed, said he did not believe Bolsonaro would immediately dismiss his minister. \u201cBut Moro\u2019s image has been damaged and Bolsonaro is clearly on the defensive, not wanting to tie himself too closely to Moro because of the chance he might have to sack him,\u201d Toledo said, pointing to Bolsonaro\u2019s failure to personally defend Moro. So far, Bolsonaro\u2019s only public statement of support has come through a spokesperson who insisted Moro enjoyed the president\u2019s \u201ccomplete trust\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will fire him today,\u201d Toledo said. \u201c[But] until Sunday night if someone had said: \u2018Bolsonaro might sack Moro,\u2019 you\u2019d have said: \u2018You\u2019re mad \u2013 you\u2019re delusional.\u2019 Today it\u2019s a possibility \u2013 not a huge possibility but a possibility.\u201d Eliane Cantanh\u00eade, a political columnist for the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, said Moro was likely to survive the Intercept\u2019s disclosures thanks to his hero status among many Brazilians. \u201cDespite being detested by the left \u2026 Moro went down in history and became internationally known for running the greatest anti-corruption investigation in the world.

But Cantanh\u00eade sensed nervousness and caution in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, that the Intercept might have \u201ca bomb\u201d up its sleeve. \u201cNobody wants to defend Moro only for more things to come out.\u201d Brian Winter, the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, said it was possible the leaks could lead to Lula\u2019s release. \u201cFor this kind of conduct to have been revealed is at the very least devastating for the image of the Car Wash probe and it could also result in the nullification of the case against Lula,\u201d said Winter, who knows Moro and expressed concern over his decision to take a job in Bolsonaro\u2019s government last year. The shockwaves would also be felt across the region, in countries such as Peru and Argentina where major corruption investigations linked to Car Wash are playing out. \u201cPeople in the anti-corruption community around Latin America were furious with S\u00e9rgio Moro when he accepted this job last year [because of the appearance of political impropriety] and they are 10 times as angry now \u2026 because it affects their work,\u201d Winter said. \u201cIt allows the corrupt to say: \u2018I am being unfairly targeted too.\u2019\u201d",

He even said he would back a Labour bill to take no deal and prorogation off the table. And with that the dream really did die. It was a matter of when, not if, his campaign turned to ash.

The bill would change present law governing prostitution, \u201cso that consenting adults who trade sex, collaborate with or support sex working peers, or patronize adult sex workers will not be criminalized\u201d, according to a press release issued by supporters. The 13-page bill \u2013 which was drafted with Decrim NY, a sex workers advocacy organization \u2013 would maintain current laws on rape, human trafficking, assault, sexual harassment and battery.

The California senator and Democratic primary contender Kamala Harris, who was once that state\u2019s attorney general, voiced support for decriminalization in an interview with the Root.

Merci beaucoup pour ... um, following along with me. I was terrible in my French classes. Probably cost me valedictorian status in high school. See you next time ... A continent brags ... How stubborn were the Chilean defenders? To answer the question of which team would be helped by the rain delay -- it was Sweden. Chile\u2019s resistance finally broke down, and the team in yellow avoid the banana peel. 90 min +5: Lopez sees yellow for a ridiculous late tackle. That could hurt down the road. And that\u2019s the last action of the game. Madelen Janogy, one of the least experienced players on the roster, must not know that you can\u2019t go 1v4. She does. She beats them all. Then she drills the ball into the near corner. A superb goal to cap off the game. 90 min +4: Sweden back in possession mode. 90 min +2: Sweden have possession in the Chilean third but give it away with an impatient ball into the box. Chile now at midfield. 90 min +1: We\u2019ll play on for five minutes. 90 min: Suddenly, it\u2019s a midfield battle, as Sweden retreat. And a SHOT. Lara takes a pass at the edge of the area and the Swedish defense lets her turn to her right. It goes over the bar, and I\u2019m not sure Lindahl would\u2019ve had that one. 89 min: Chile get a free kick. There\u2019s nothing to it. But they did put numbers forward, so maybe they\u2019re not completely content to park it at 0-1. 88 min: Chile have settled for 0-1. The Fox crew are talking about goal differential, and they point to the fact that Chile just brought in a defender. Four third-place teams go through. So Chile must be thinking that they can beat Thailand, then maybe hold the USA and go through on goal difference. 87 min: Nearly a second goal. A ball over the top to Jakobsson. Endler can\u2019t get there in time. The lob goes over the bar. 85 min: And the game changes ... The Chilean players gather in a state of shock. Sweden are pinging the ball around at will. Not sure Chile will see much of the ball. Chilean sub: Soto is in. It\u2019s scrappy, but they\u2019ll take it. A poor cross pings in the box. The sub, Janogy, pops it forward. It\u2019s touched again, and Asllani cleans up with an emphatic close-range shot into the top of the net. 78 min: Endler sets a four-person wall. The ref paints a line. There\u2019s a palpable sense that this is a big moment. And it\u2019s ... tricky! Seger passes it to the edge of the area. Then there\u2019s a one-touch pass straight ahead to an onrushing forward, but that touch is too heavy, and Endler is happy to gobble it up like she\u2019s in Hungry Hungry Hippos. 77 min: Sweden are playing out of the back, and Chile are actually pressing a bit. Maybe they figure they can go high-energy after that delay? But Asllani wins a free kick just outside the box. Yellow card to Guerrero. I\u2019m being asked the name of a funky song the BBC is playing. That will be rather difficult to answer from the suburbs of Washington, DC. How would a draw affect the USA? The good news would be that their biggest rival in the group will drop two points. The bad news is that they still have to face Endler. 74 min: SHOT! And it\u2019s the best shot of the game for Sweden. Jakobsson fires from the right of the area, and Endler has to tip it over. Two more corners follow. Endler punches each one clear. 72 min: Sweden pick-up with a throw-in that rolls out of play. Yikes. Can Sweden turn its dominance into a winning goal? Whoa ... they\u2019re saying two minutes now? Now Fox is saying it\u2019s 10 minutes, not 20. Oh boy. I just let the dog out. Back on the field ... They get 20 minutes to warm up. Not sure of the exact time they stepped back on the field. I\u2019ll be back in five. Break time Reconvene in 15 minutes, everyone? If you\u2019re watching USA-Thailand by the time this one resumes, you\u2019ll have all the more reason to keep this commentary on your screen! The FIFA regulations tell us ... ... very little. Seems like the decision on when to restart is at FIFA\u2019s discretion. The radar is promising. More email: Olympia Diamond is at work at grateful for the commentary. By the time this storm clears, you might be home from work. Peter Oh wants to know if they\u2019re serving orange slices during the delay. I\u2019ll take one. Need something nutritious after that cake. Gerard Nugent wants to know the policy on restarting, which I\u2019m going to read right now. Well, after I make a correction pointed out by Pavel Rubio Hormazabal. Some photographers are calling Christiane Endler \u201cClaudia\u201d instead, and I missed it on one of the captions. I\u2019ll fix it now. Reminder: We are in a delay due to a thunderstorm. Let\u2019s check the email ... Sarah Rothwell apologizes for not watching this match: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just watching you (or your MBM, at least). My neighbour\u2019s cat insists I bring home a pay check so that he can continue living in the manner to which he has become accustomed.\u201d Is your neighbor (I\u2019m American, so I\u2019ll drop the \u201cu\u201d) related to Chuck Blazer? Meanwhile, at the U-20 tournament ... Want some controversy? Accuweather does not give us much hope here. To answer one email: We\u2019ll need to figure out how long a delay they can weather. (Sorry, that\u2019s awful.) On Fox, Ariane Hingst thinks the delay will help Chile re-organize. Heather O\u2019Reilly thinks it will benefit Sweden because their offense is misfiring. I\u2019m with Hingst. Sweden was getting closer and closer. It\u2019ll be a while. Fox informs us that they\u2019ll follow the 30-minute rule familiar to all of us youth soccer coaches. Then something we don\u2019t get in youth soccer -- a 20-minute warmup. The officials have cleared the field due to the weather. Thunder has been heard. Not to be selfish here, but this means I might miss part of the USA-Thailand match. I still have to vote in a local election. 70 min: A couple of shots are blocked, and then Eriksson sends one just over the bar. To follow up on the last one -- so is anyone watching THIS game? A stat that could be read as a good sign for women\u2019s soccer or evidence of the stench hanging over the U.S. men. 67 min: A yellow card for Eriksson, who might have slid farther than expected on the wet pitch. She catches Lopez on the foot, and Lopez is down. Not doubting that the collision hurt, but we\u2019re to the point in the match at which Chile might spend a few more seconds on these situations. Lopez is checked for a while but then gives a thumbs-up as she walks away. 65 min: Swedish subs -- Blackstenius out, Anvegard in. That\u2019s a drop in experience. Rolfo out, Hurtig in. 64 min: And the next corner is played in front of the mob. That\u2019s unfortunate, because that means the ball is out of play. Subs stepping up for Sweden. 62 min: A quick check of Twitter finds that no one I follow is watching this match, which is a pity. Sweden are getting closer to that breakthrough. A shot clangs off Lara for a corner. This one actually goes into the six-yard area, and is cleared for another corner. 60 min: Sweden are finding much more space in the second half. They\u2019re stretching the defense and putting dangerous crosses into the box. One is played out for another corner, and we have maybe 12 players in the six-yard area. Eriksson plays it behind all of them, and Seger steps back for a weak header. That\u2019s probably not what they intended. 58 min: Another head collision, and Chilean forward Mar\u00eda Urrutia is taken off on a stretcher. Chile will not wait to see if she passes the trainer\u2019s check -- Yesenia L\u00f3pez is sent into the game in her place. 56 min: Rolfo brings the ball straight down the middle, with a couple of players wide and not too many Chilean defenders back. But she finds the inevitable futility of indecision, eventually firing harmlessly with a couple of defenders ahead of her. The deflection is no problem for Endler. A second camera view confirms that it\u2019s raining. Substantially. Fans are moving under cover. 55 min: We\u2019re told that it\u2019s raining, even though it looks like a bright, sunshiny day. A through ball finds Blackstenius, who takes a rather pointless touch toward the end line rather than the goal. The flag goes up, anyway. 53 min: Another long shot from Chile. Lara is 35 yards out and decides to see if she can lob one over Lindahl. She does, but it\u2019s over the bar as well. That\u2019s basically the view from the typical press tribune. 50 min: CHANCE! Seger swipes the ball in the center, and Sweden have a 4v4. The ball goes wide to Rolfo, whose tame shot is made wild by a deflection that misses by an uncomfortable margin. The ensuing corner is unremarkable. 48 min: Hmmm. Jakobsson gets into the area, and Saez gets a foot between her and the ball. I\u2019m no ref, but ... oh, wait, I am. That seemed more interesting than a lot of the incidents that have gone to VAR in this Cup. Kickoff: Chile play the ball deep into the Swedish half. Nothing interesting results. With passing stats like that, Chile might need a Said Owairan-style run to score. (Coincidentally, that\u2019s the only men\u2019s World Cup match I\u2019ve ever attended.) The story of the World Cup so far is that favored teams are having trouble breaking down teams with resolute defenses and the occasional counterattack. Japan failed to score against Argentina Canada labored to get one goal against Cameroon Germany only got one against China And Australia paid the price, losing 1-2 to Italy The story of the half is Chilean keeper Christiane Endler, who has lived up to the hype. Correction: It is obviously not 0-1. Apologies. 45 min +3: Fifth corner of the half for Sweden. This one goes to the middle of the 6-yard box, and somehow, Endler\u2019s fist sends it clear. 45 min +2: There\u2019s your long-range shot! A lob sends Lindahl scrambling, but it\u2019s too high. 45 min: Swedish corner kick to the near post. Deflects out. Shot hits Chilean defender. Follow-up shot goes toward the heavens. The women in yellow are frustrated. 44 min: CHANCE! Asllani puts a cross right where Blackstenius wants to go. She gets there but gets her head on the underside of the ball, which simple physics will tell us is not a dangerous shot. If she had risen a couple of inches higher, that would have been a stern test for Endler. Email from Rob Edwards: \u201cSo far I\u2019ve been disappointed we haven\u2019t seen too many long range efforts on goal to test the goalies. Feels like that could be a good approach for some of the lesser fancied teams struggling to move play up-field like Chile.\u201d And there\u2019s been some talk that Swedish keeper Hedvig Lindahl is past her best. No such talk about Endler, obviously. 41 min: Chilean shot! A quick sequence ends in an optimistic shot that whistles well wide of the post. But they\u2019re smiling. 40 min: Sweden could possibly use a bit more patience. They get the ball deep one more time down the right flank, but it ends with a harmless shot. 38 min: A Swedish free kick sees a training-ground effort to send everyone in motion. The ball, though, does not connect with any of them, so it\u2019s a bit of a waste of energy. 37 min: A Chilean counter sees an attempt to chip a ball over the defense to catch a forward making a well-timed run, but it\u2019s headed clear. Quickly the other way, and Blackstenius gets on the end of a beautiful low cross to the middle of the area. But Endler comes out and gives Blackstenius no angle to shoot, and the ball goes wide. 35 min: Another save for Endler, this one rather routine. Not much contact on the header from eight-yards out, and Endler simply catches it on the bounce. Chile get the ball down the right flank but conspire to knock it out of play under moderate pressure. That bodes ill for any attacks going the other direction. 33 min: Another Chilean defender down, Guerrero this time. Players take advantage of the stoppage to get some water. Alas, I do not have time to raid the fridge. Need to wash down that cake. 31 min: And another Endler save, a header in a dangerous spot but drilled straight at the Chilean keeper\u2019s stomach. 29 min: ESPN tells us Sweden has outpossessed Chile 74%-26%, but Chile have the only shot on goal. Not sure about that. Endler has twice had to snag or swat the ball just in front of the line, and each time, the ball was quite deliberately sent in that direction. That seems like a shot on goal to me. And she\u2019s once again in action, racing out to collect a through ball. 27 min: Replay from the side of the goal shows that shot got within a foot or two of the line before Endler managed to reach back and get her hand to it. Chile again get possession in the attacking third, but it\u2019s brief. 25 min: Third corner kick for Sweden, and we once again have a convention at the near post. AND IT\u2019S CLOSE! No idea off which player that ball caromed, but Endler, like a good hockey goalie, manages to spot the ball in time and swat it away. 23 min: Now Sweden are packing their own box out of necessity as the Chilean front line presses and completes a couple of passes. Halfway through the half, Sweden certainly look superior to Chile but have yet to take full control. Best way to do that would be to score, and they haven\u2019t come close to that. Just two half-chances. Email roundup: Sticksportsfan predicts a 2-0 Swedish win. Pablo Kiessling tells us Fernanda Pinilla is a PhD student in physics at Universidad de Chile. And Ann Munn points out a neat fact of geography \u2013 this is the Arctic v the Antarctic. Maybe they\u2019ll have a Nordic skiing tiebreaker. 18 min: So we go 10v10 for a short time, and the slight bit of extra space gives Sweden a chance to put a tantalizing ball through the penalty area. 16 min: Another high shot! This time it\u2019s Hedvig Lindahl who has to focus as she backpedals. Two players down after a difficult collision. One is Asllani, who would be a tremendous loss. The other is S\u00e1ez. They\u2019re holding their heads. Time to be checked out a bit. 15 min: Set pieces can change a game, but Chile\u2019s free kick from the right flank hits a gaggle of Swedish defenders. 13 min: Another long sequence of passes until Magdalena Eriksson decides she\u2019s had enough of this and strikes a ball from the left 25 yards out. It\u2019s actually awkward for Endler, who has to backpedal all the way to her line to catch the high shot. 11 min: Another bit of Chilean possession on the left flank, this time with Rosario Balmaceda. Nothing threatening right now, though. 8 min: Chile counter! Francisca Lara shrugs off a defender on the left flank. 7 min: Chile briefly had seven players within six yards of the end line. It\u2019s the old chicken-or-egg argument -- are they packing it back deliberately, or are they simply unable to get the ball. Now a corner in which roughly 80 players are crowded in the 6-yard box by the near post. 5 min: Javiera Toro is rather apologetic after accidentally whacking Asllani in the calf. A foul gives Endler a chance to clear the lines, but Sweden win it back with ease. 3 min: First shot of the game. A curling cross from finds Sofia Jakobsson a few yards out. She had a defender close by and can\u2019t get a clean shot. Sweden do earn a corner, which is promptly squandered. 2 min: Sweden connecting a few passes rather easily, with a brief interruption in which Chile managed to whack the ball forward. Kickoff: Sweden quickly chips the ball into the attacking third. From J.R. in Illinois: \u201cHey Beau, Sounds like Chile may have an advantage having a nutrition student in the team because I assume to win the World Cup, just like Ryan Giggs said of the Premier League, \u201cIt\u2019s a war of nutrition\u201d. Also, you can\u2019t leave us hanging. You now must tell us what you are eating for lunch.\u201d Some belVita biscuits. Then a diet soda. And because we just celebrated my mother-in-law\u2019s milestone birthday, some cake. I\u2019ve lost more than 30 pounds in the last 15 months, so I\u2019m trying to find them. From a correspondent who played a bit of high-level football ... We\u2019ll see! She might be busy today. But so far, it\u2019s surely UNC Wilmington\u2019s Sydney Schneider (Jamaica), isn\u2019t it? From the emails, a word from Abhijato Sensarma: \u201cWhile one knows in their heart that Sweden should come out on top today, a Chile win will produce shockwaves and make this a much more interesting tournament!\u201d Perhaps, but aren\u2019t we all hoping the USA and Sweden have six points each when they meet for first place in the group? The winner would likely face ... France. OK, maybe first place isn\u2019t so desirable. Please do share your thoughts by email or Twitter. Just don\u2019t call. I get so many robocalls, especially with local elections coming up, that I generally send everything to voice mail. Random fact: Chilean forward Rosario Balcameda\u2019s Instagram feed says she is an \u201cestudiante de nutrici\u00f3n.\u201d Please don\u2019t tell her what I\u2019m eating for lunch. The Fox Sports pregame commentary can be summed up as follows ... Sweden can\u2019t score. Chile can\u2019t defend. So it\u2019s the classic \u201cresistible force against a movable object\u201d matchup. Sweden: Intro and lineup Forget the bunker-and-counter of the 2016 Olympic quarterfinal. Sweden can pick teams apart. The Guardian\u2019s profile tells us coach Peter Gerhardsson, who replaced U.S. coach-turned-tormenter Pia Sundhage, has been playing the ball from the back in a dynamic 4-2-3-1 formation. The anchor is the veteran Caroline Seger, who played a couple of years in Women\u2019s Professional Soccer before that U.S. league shut down and has passed through the glitzy squad at Lyon. Kosovare Asllani is a potent attacker who also played a bit in WPS. Nilla Fischer, a longtime player with German powerhouse Wolfsburg, provides defensive stability. All three of those players are in The Guardian\u2019s top 100 in the world, as are Bayern Munich forward Fridolina Rolf\u00f6 and young Montpellier forward Stina Blackstenius. The starters are: GK: Lindahl D (r-l): Glas, Fischer, Sembrant, Eriksson M: Rubensson, Asllani, Seger (captain) F: Jakobsson, Blackstenius, Rolf\u00f6 Chile: Intro and lineup The South American runners-up have a defense and goalkeeper who will make things difficult. Christiane Endler, who played college soccer at South Florida, started in goal for Paris St. Germain in the Champions League quarterfinals and was named to The Guardian\u2019s top 100 list for her heroics in getting Chile through the Copa America Femenina. Two defenders (Rocio Soto, Su Helen Galaz) play in Spain with Zaragoza; two more (Camila S\u00e1ez, Carla Guerrero) play with Rayo Vallecano. The midfield and front line also have a couple of players in the Spanish league. The best-known player to U.S. fans would be Yanara Aedo, formerly of the Washington Spirit. (She also scored the winning goal when the Spirit Reserves won the 2015 W-League championship. No, not the Australian W-League.) The starters are: GK: Endler D (r-l): Galaz, Guerrero, S\u00e1ez, Toro M: Araya, Aedo, Lara F: Zamora, Urrutia, Balmaceda So that\u2019s six players based in Spain in the defense and midfield. The forwards are all based in South America. I turned up for a recent refereeing assignment blasting Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cShake It Off\u201d in my car. I\u2019m not one to judge. Besides when you\u2019re a referee, singing about how the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate is rather apt. Good day or evening to all. Let\u2019s state the obvious here -- the main interest in this game from a U.S. point of view is that these teams are the next two opponents in group play. But it\u2019s also a classic matchup between a perennial contender and a team that has never been on this sort of stage before. Sweden has never won the grand prize at the World Cup or Olympics, but the team has been pesky since international play began in earnest in the 1990s. Also, and we hate to bring up a bad memory for U.S. fans, but the Swedes knocked the USA out of the 2016 Olympics. Chile has never qualified for anything. The most startling stat in The Guardian\u2019s profile: The country has 727 women registered as adult players. That\u2019s it. But they\u2019ve ramped up a good bit in the last decade, with nearly a dozen players signed to European clubs, including most of the players at the back. The assumption in this group is that the USA and Sweden will bulldoze their way through their first two games before settling the group winner in a grudge match. But this World Cup has already seen some traditional powers and new favorites struggling to break through against the underdogs. Scotland made things interesting against England. Cameroon proved to be stubborn opposition for Canada. And Italy returned to the top international level with a win over Australia, whom some of us picked to reach the final. (OK, maybe just me.) Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here are our guides to today\u2019s protagonists:",

      "bodyText": "Three members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee have warned the UK remains on track to raise interest rates several times over the next couple of years, despite a global slowdown in trade and the likelihood of falling interest rates in the US. The deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, said the Bank\u2019s health check on the UK economy in early May showed it warranted higher interest rates than financial markets currently expect. He said there was no reason to alter the Bank\u2019s outlook when its monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, meets next week. Broadbent backed comments made by the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, and Michael Saunders, a former City analyst who is an external member of the nine-strong MPC. Haldane said the time was nearing for a rate rise to nip inflation pressure in the bud, while Saunders said Brexit uncertainty was not a reason to delay rate rises. Broadbent told a parliamentary committee: \u201cWere the economy to develop in line with our projection ... interest rates would probably have to rise by a little more than what was in the curve at the time of the forecast.\u201d He told MPs financial market investors disagreed with the Bank\u2019s outlook, but he was untroubled by this given the deep uncertainty about Brexit that could change the outlook significantly. The Bank\u2019s forecasts assume Britain will avoid an abrupt departure from the EU. However, the benign forecast was challenged by another MPC member, Gertjan Vlieghe, at an event in London. \u201cThe news since May I think has been ... a little disappointing and in terms of both the global downside risks and the domestic downside risks my read is that they have both intensified,\u201d he said. The World Bank has forecast a slowdown in trade and a collapse in investment spending will push down global GDP growth to 2.6% this year, \u201cbefore inching up to 2.7% in 2020\u201d. Investors expect the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times this year in response to a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. Vlieghe\u2019s comments are likely to be supported by other committee members including the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney.

Smith, making his Championship debut at just 18 in place of the injured Rory Burns, did not suffer from comparison with his elegant acting captain, Foakes. If he could not quite match the hundred he made on first-class debut against MCC in March, his 56 was bubbling with potential.<br><br>Twenty-two wickets fell on a heavenly day for seam bowling at Canterbury. Lewis Gregory took six for 32 as <strong>Kent</strong> were dismissed for 139, then Harry Podmore, Matthew Milnes and Grant Stewart pocketed three each as <strong>Somerset </strong>limped to 169. There was time for Gregory and Jamie Overton to strike once more in Kent\u2019s second innings before stumps and a lie\u2011down.

I would like to contribute to the conversation by talking about a place where the situation is the exact opposite - India.</em></p> <p><em><br>Cricket is the most dominant sport in the country by far. The presence of decent cricket clubs around every corner, the gltiz and glamour of cricketing superstars in the country especially after the emergence of the IPL, and the tradition of developing skills in one\u2019s childhood through playing \u2018gully cricket\u2019 (cricket on the streets) means that the game overshadows many other sports. Despite the questionable practices of the BCCI while governing the game in their own country and at the ICC, no one can blame them for overlooking grassroots level development of new players, unlike countries like Australia and England (the former is already facing the consequences; the latter will in the near future). </em></p> <p><em><br>Most of the cricket appears on pay TV which is not too expensive for the middle economic sections. Cheap 4G data and orders by the Supreme Court to broadcast India\u2019s matches on DD (India\u2019s BBC) means cricket reaches most of the people in most of the country, including the rural areas.</em></p> <p><em><br>The huge population of the country ensures that India will continue to produce the world\u2019s best all-format performers and performances for many years to come. Instead of throwing up their hands and/or looking at India as a mere brutal dictator, the ECB and other boards need to look at what BCCI (and its many state associations) have gotten right, which is a lot the others haven\u2019t. </em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T16:30:31.048Z\">at 5.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cffd3678f0863265fe97db3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T16:16:49.181Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And that is Smith\u2019s fifty:104 balls, five fours</strong>.

Little rain in the past few weeks despite it being the start of the rainy season. It is interesting that football is slowly gaining ground here after being a very minor sport in the land of basketball and boxing. Every game of the last two World Cups was shown free in the Philippines on terrestial TV and gained some following. Also Premiership games and the champions league are screened free of charge. FIFA is savvy in making World Cups available on terrestrial TV worldwide to increase interest, while cricket hides behind paywalls...</em></p> <p><em>Having said that cricket has never been really popular in UK, apart from Botham\u2019s heroics in 1981 and the 2005 Ashes. I remember being able to walk into Lord\u2019s and the Oval on the Saturday of the Ashes in the 1970s when those grounds were not full. Few sell outs. Other test grounds had pathetic attendances. County cricket crowds were perhaps worse than they are now. But at least cricket was always on TV to keep it in the public eye.</em></p> <p><em> Other sports such as rugby have managed to retain some major matches on terrestial TV while also doing pay TV deals. The ECB\u2019s decision to put all its eggs in one basket with Sky has been a disaster. In my early days as a reporter I was offered a job as a cricket correspondent in UK before I moved overseas. There was very little money in the game before the Kerry Packer revolution but it was talked about much more and certainly had many more players at the grassroots. Like many others I enjoyed playing Twenty/20 on summer evenings in the 1960s long before the ECB discovered it. It is sad to see the way in which those who now run it have taken the sport. Hope the weather improves for you soon. </em><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cffab208f0863265fe97b1e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T13:37:34.671Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Borthwick</strong> fiddling with this, fidding with that, helmet, pads, box, gloves.

      "bodyText": "At Guildford a golden over by Steve Patterson kept Yorkshire in the hunt after a day dominated by Surrey\u2019s batsmen. Running in from the pavilion end, Patterson took three wickets in six balls, all of them bowled, as Ben Foakes tried a nudge to third man, Will Jacks shouldered arms and Jamie Smith drove over the top of an in-ducker. The over broke a stand of 118 between Smith and Foakes that was a crunchy combination of defence and dress\u2011for-dinner attack. Smith, making his Championship debut at just 18 in place of the injured Rory Burns, did not suffer from comparison with his elegant acting captain, Foakes. If he could not quite match the hundred he made on first-class debut against MCC in March, his 56 was bubbling with potential. Twenty-two wickets fell on a heavenly day for seam bowling at Canterbury. Lewis Gregory took six for 32 as Kent were dismissed for 139, then Harry Podmore, Matthew Milnes and Grant Stewart pocketed three each as Somerset limped to 169. There was time for Gregory and Jamie Overton to strike once more in Kent\u2019s second innings before stumps and a lie\u2011down. The latter removed Joe Denly, who had fallen to the bowler\u2019s twin, Craig, in the first innings. At Chester-le-Street, an unbeaten hundred from Ricardo Vasconcelos helped Northamptonshire creep into the lead against Durham. Chris Rushworth and Brydon Carse grabbed three wickets each. Will Beer, promoted from Sussex\u2019s No 9 last week to opener this week, made a career best 76 not out, off 276 balls, against Gloucestershire at Arundel. A sluggish pitch made the morning a slow-going trudge, but with the sun came a more upbeat tempo, thanks to Stiaan van Zyl (54) and Ben Brown (33). The weather truncated play at Swansea, rain slicing off the first session, bad light filleting the last. In between, Glamorgan reached 167 for five against Derbyshire. There was no play possible at New Road, Welbeck or Grace Road. What a ridiculous day at Canterbury - 22 wickets and counting. Elsewhere, Yorkshire fought back at Guildford, Northants went into the lead at Chester-le-Street, and it was slow going at Swansea and Arundel. Thanks for all your messages and chat BTL. See you tomorrow, when hopefully the weather will be kind. Goodnight! And with Surrey wobbling, I better write a round-up. Northants ahead, and Somerset nearly there. And ANOTHER! Three wickets in five balls for Patterson - all of them bowled. Smith, head down, sloths off for 56. Surrey 266 for seven. At 5.20, Ben Foakes tries to cut at Steven Patterson and is bowled. And the very next ball, Will Jacks, shouldering arms, follows suit. The dominoes start to tilt. Surrey 265 for six. A thoughtful reply to David Macolm from Abhijato Sensarma in India: Mr Malcolm has authored an excellent piece of correspondence @14.51. I would like to contribute to the conversation by talking about a place where the situation is the exact opposite - India. Cricket is the most dominant sport in the country by far. The presence of decent cricket clubs around every corner, the gltiz and glamour of cricketing superstars in the country especially after the emergence of the IPL, and the tradition of developing skills in one\u2019s childhood through playing \u2018gully cricket\u2019 (cricket on the streets) means that the game overshadows many other sports. Despite the questionable practices of the BCCI while governing the game in their own country and at the ICC, no one can blame them for overlooking grassroots level development of new players, unlike countries like Australia and England (the former is already facing the consequences; the latter will in the near future). Most of the cricket appears on pay TV which is not too expensive for the middle economic sections. Cheap 4G data and orders by the Supreme Court to broadcast India\u2019s matches on DD (India\u2019s BBC) means cricket reaches most of the people in most of the country, including the rural areas. The huge population of the country ensures that India will continue to produce the world\u2019s best all-format performers and performances for many years to come. Instead of throwing up their hands and/or looking at India as a mere brutal dictator, the ECB and other boards need to look at what BCCI (and its many state associations) have gotten right, which is a lot the others haven\u2019t. And that is Smith\u2019s fifty:104 balls, five fours. A modest bat raise round the ground. When I finished my A levels, I had a highly unsuccessful spell as a door-to-door salesperson. Nice to see Dom Bess having a bowl again, even as part of a rather ineffective Yorkshire attack this afternoon. Smith and Foakes are batting carefully but gorgeously, partnership now 108. And a pair of parakeets fly over the ground. Somerset 115 for five and in with more than a sniff. Banton 53 not out. Northants nearly level, 221 for six. Durham need a Rushworth-special. Vasconcelos 90 not out. Glamorgan 157 for five; Sussex 224 for four - Beer still there on 69. This for our Lancashire fans having withdrawal symptoms: Two celebrity spots - Giles Clarke and Liam Plunkett. Can anyone raise me? Foakes passes fifty with 82 balls, six fours and a flourish. The applause is more than rippling - vigorous? Look at these shadows. Oh, for some shadows. At Swansea, David Lloyd has fallen after tea for 32: Glam 127 for four. Some clouds gather ominously above Guildford, though I still saw ice-creams at tea. Rain is due, probably before the close - Foakes and Smith looking drop-down good. I hate to write this but Smith made a hundred on his first-class debut, so wouldn\u2019t it be nice if.... Division One Welbeck (day 3): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2. PLAY CALLED OFF FOR THE DAY Canterbury: Kent 139 (Gregory 6-32, Brooks 2-22) v Somerset 66-4 (Podmore 3-12). Guildford: Surrey 212-4 (Stoneman 61) v Yorkshire. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham 253 (Sanderson 4-55; Raine 82 , Carse 77 not out) v Northamptonshire 175-6 (Vasconcelos 77 not out; Carse 3-42 ; Rushworth 3-29) Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex PLAY CALLED OFF FOR THE DAY Worcester: Worcestershire 98 all out (Onions 4-55, Anderson 4-24, Mahmood 2-8; Barnard 32) v Lancashire. PLAY CALLED OFF FOR THE DAY Day 1 Swansea: Glamorgan 114-3 v Derbyshire Arundel: Sussex v Gloucestershire 168-3 (Beer 55 not out) This boy Smith can bat a bit. Utterly confident, Boycott-purring defence, ferrari-purring attack. Yorkshire name their KSL squad for this year, with Alyssa Healy playing KSL for the first time and cementing the link with Yorkshire where her husband Mitchell Starc also played. Northants closing in on Durham\u2019s hard work, 161 for three. Vasconcelos 75, Durham 161 for three. Sussex and Glamorgan also three down. As far as I can work out Lewis Gregory has the most CC wickets in Div one other than Simon Harmer and Jeetan Patel. Banton and Bartlett staring the recovery at Canterbury. And a bit of Ben Foakes to cheer you up. He\u2019s just a super little batsman, classy, swift of foot and quick of bat. There he goes again against Thompson. Crack. Somerset, don\u2019t do this. 14/3, still 125 runs behind Kent. Whither Tres? In Division Two, every side batting has lost two wickets, which is strangely pleasing in a line-up- your -pens-in-a- straight-line kind of way. Northants 132/2; Glamorgan 70/2 and Sussex 143/2. I forgot to mention that the World Cup game at Bristol was abandoned without a ball bowled and WHAT IS THIS MADNESS? Somerset 6 for 2 - Hildreth and Azhar out for ducks. A wind blows up from the Railway End, and scorecards go flying. So does Borthwick - another for Thompson. Surrey 147-4. David Malcolm writes from the Philippines. I am viewing from the Philippines where virtually no one knows the cricket World Cup is taking place. Little rain in the past few weeks despite it being the start of the rainy season. It is interesting that football is slowly gaining ground here after being a very minor sport in the land of basketball and boxing. Every game of the last two World Cups was shown free in the Philippines on terrestial TV and gained some following. Also Premiership games and the champions league are screened free of charge. FIFA is savvy in making World Cups available on terrestrial TV worldwide to increase interest, while cricket hides behind paywalls... Having said that cricket has never been really popular in UK, apart from Botham\u2019s heroics in 1981 and the 2005 Ashes. I remember being able to walk into Lord\u2019s and the Oval on the Saturday of the Ashes in the 1970s when those grounds were not full. Few sell outs. Other test grounds had pathetic attendances. County cricket crowds were perhaps worse than they are now. But at least cricket was always on TV to keep it in the public eye. Other sports such as rugby have managed to retain some major matches on terrestial TV while also doing pay TV deals. The ECB\u2019s decision to put all its eggs in one basket with Sky has been a disaster. In my early days as a reporter I was offered a job as a cricket correspondent in UK before I moved overseas. There was very little money in the game before the Kerry Packer revolution but it was talked about much more and certainly had many more players at the grassroots. Like many others I enjoyed playing Twenty/20 on summer evenings in the 1960s long before the ECB discovered it. It is sad to see the way in which those who now run it have taken the sport. Hope the weather improves for you soon. Scott Borthwick fiddling with this, fidding with that, helmet, pads, box, gloves. Looking pretty solid, 19 not out. Funny to think of him on that Ashes tour of 2013-14, plucked from his daydreams for the Sydney Test. Since then his bat has done more of the talking and the Surrey years have been relatively, relatively, barren. Runs, without being match-winning and not often thrown the ball. And that\u2019s Ryan Patel gone, lbw for 19, Surrey 142/3. Patel\u2019s stride slows to snail pace as he approaches the pavilion. Kent are 8 down, a fourth for Gregory. Two wickets for Carse, who is having a good game, at Chester-le-Street. Ben Curran and Wakeley. Surrey pottering along 129 for two. Selman out for a duck at Swansea, Glam 36 for one. Beer\u2019s 38 not out sustaining Sussex at Arundel (86-2). And at Grace Road, an arboreal casualty. There\u2019s a gorgeous little cottage for sale just on the corner of the cricket ground, in case anyone was thinking of moving to Guildford. I\u2019ve just a quick nosey round the revamped pavilion. Such a sensational role call of players on the wall: Will Jacks, Ollie Pope, Phil Salt, Darren Bicknell, Martin Bicknell, Chris Thompson, Ashley Giles, Rikki Clarke, Jade Dernbach and still more. They\u2019ve given up at New Road - no play today. Sorry Lancs. Four games are currently being played, two have been called off for the day, two have been delayed by rain. Division One Welbeck (day 3): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2. PLAY CALLED OFF FOR THE DAY Canterbury: Kent 121-7 (Gregory 3-29, Brooks 2-7) v Somerset. Guildford: Surrey 117-2 (Stoneman 61) v Yorkshire. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham 253 (Sanderson 4-55; Raine 82 , Carse 77 not out) v Northamptonshire 46-0. Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex PLAY CALLED OFF FOR THE DAY Worcester: Worcestershire 98 all out (Onions 4-55, Anderson 4-24, Mahmood 2-8; Barnard 32) v Lancashire. START DELAYED, RAIN Day 1 Swansea: Glamorgan v Derbyshire PLAY DUE TO START AT 1.30PM Arundel: Sussex v Gloucestershire 47-2 Patel and Borthwick navigate safely through to lunch. Surrey 116 for two. Scores to follow. Just glanced through a round-up of Durham\u2019s morning. Sounds like poor Jack Burnham had a few hours to forget. He dropped Ben Curran on 18 off Chris Rushworth. The following delivery he dropped Ricardo Vasconcelos on 10. Then Curran again on 26. It will all look better in the morning. G-G-Gregory, slayer of the Kentish team. There was a cat that really was gone. 101 for seven. (3-15) You can watch the rain fall at New Road, you can watch the rain fall at Welbeck, you can watch the rain fall at Bristol with Rob Smyth. He does it well. Kent lose another on the ch of lunch - 101 for six. As do Surrey 98 for two. Thompson gets his first wicket, Stoneman caught Tattersall for 61. Enter Ryan Patel, to the scene of his great bowling triumph last year. Luke Wells falls at Arundel, Sussex 33 for one. At Chester le Street, Northants are choosing to ignore Durham\u2019s example and take a more usual approach to batting - start well and then tail off as the wickets fall. 29/0. A wicket! A wide delivery from Steven Patterson that Dean Elgar tried to squeeze out and drove to cover point where it was caught by Dom Bess. Surrey 78 for one. Jordan Thompson takes the ball. He\u2019s 22, born in Leeds, a prolific hat-trick taker in junior cricket, plays for Pudsey St Lawrence and spent the winter in Australia. Graham also tells me his dad was in The Bill - but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a wind up. Oh to be in Arundel... (in 2014 - I can\u2019t find any pictures from today. Can you identify the opposition?) Some World Cup news: Marcue Stoinis is out of Australia\u2019s World Cup clash with Pakistan, Mitch Marsh flying out as replacement. India\u2019s Shikhar Dhawan is ruled out for three weeks of World Cup action with injured thumb. Also, there will be no play before lunch at New Road. Durham all out for 253, after adding a magnificent 172 for the last three wickets. The Surrey opening pair have added fifty without being troubled, and Sussex are pottering along: 20/0. Is that a Championship I see before me? Kent now 45-5, as Gregory and Joverton join the party. Jack Brooks picking up where he left off at Guildford last week: five overs, two for three. Craig Overton has the other one. Kent wobbling 42/3. These viewing figures were salutary yesterday. Comparing eggs and chips of course, but it would have been nice to have at least some of the games on terrestrial. The England games. Ben Raine falls for 82, but Durham plough on, 244 for nine. It\u2019s almost majestic. Four games are currently being played, four are in various states of distress. Division One Welbeck (day 3): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2. PLAY CALLED OFF FOR THE DAY Canterbury: Kent (5-1) v Somerset. Guildford: Surrey (8-0) v Yorkshire. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham 219-7 (Sanderson 3-39; Raine 75 not out, Carse 47 not out) v Northamptonshire Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex NO PLAY BEFORE LUNCH Worcester: Worcestershire 98 all out (Onions 4-55, Anderson 4-24, Mahmood 2-8; Barnard 32) v Lancashire. START DELAYED, RAIN Day 1 Swansea: Glamorgan v Derbyshire PLAY WILL START AT NOON Arundel: Sussex v Gloucestershire (8-0) Sorry for the confusion, Jamie Smith will bat at No.6 for Surrey, Elgar and Stoneman have opened. If he\u2019s as good as they say, it might be worth peeking at the live stream when he comes in. He\u2019s just finished his A-levels and now finds himself opening the batting for Surrey - beat that BTL-ers! Coad and Olivier have bowled an over each, without too much discomfort for the batsman. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after the deluge, the pitch, the outfield, are tortoise like. There are a couple of changes to the Surrey side - Rory Burns is out with a back injury to be replaced by 18 year old wicket-batsman Jamie Smith, who Alec Stewart has described as, \u201cvery special.\u201d Jordan Clark also makes his Surrey Championship debut, instead of Gareth Batty. And for Yorkshire, Jordan Thompson makes his debut in place of David Willey. Galoshes update: After an inspection the umpires have called off play for the day at Welbeck, Delayed start at Swansea, and probably at Durham where its drizzling and the covers are on. There\u2019s an inspection at the World Cup game between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at 10.30. But play will start on time at Guildford and Canterbury and Arundel. Soggyness update one: there will be no play before lunch at Grace Road, and prospects for the day are dubious. Division One Welbeck (day 3): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2. Canterbury: Kent v Somerset. Guildford: Surrey v Yorkshire. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham 209-7 (Sanderson 3-39; Raine 75 not out, Carse 47 not out) v Northamptonshire Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex Worcester: Worcestershire 98 all out (Onions 4-55, Anderson 4-24, Mahmood 2-8; Barnard 32) v Lancashire. Day 1 Swansea: Glamorgan v Derbyshire Arundel: Sussex v Gloucestershire Good morning from Guildford where though the clouds are grey, the sun is out, and the players are warming up with a spot of football. We think we\u2019ll start on time, though the Yorkshire coach only arrived at 945am so perhaps they know something we don\u2019t... Around the grounds, the forecast is better than yesterday - I\u2019ll have a quick scout about now for some up to date news. We also have two new games starting today - at Arundel where Sussex play Gloucestershire, and at Swansea, where Glamorgan play Derbyshire.",

Waverers may conclude they\u2019ve made their point that CVAs are not a slam dunk for struggling retailers and quietly fall into line.

Green\u2019s reputation would take another hit, but he\u2019s probably beyond caring. Arcadia\u2019s pension fund, complete with a deficit of \u00a3750m on one accounting measure, would fall into the Pension Protection Fund and, unlike at BHS, the Pensions Regulator would struggle to chase him for serious top-up payments.

Green and his wife paid themselves a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 and could, in any subsequent year, have chosen to hand back some of their winnings to repair the pension deficit. Instead, they still cruise the Mediterranean in a superyacht.</p> <p>For parallel reasons, you see why Intu is furious. If it agrees rental concessions to a billionaire sunning himself in the waters off Monaco, what\u2019s it supposed to say to other tenants who would also like to pay less? On the other hand, Intu is kidding itself if it thinks it can seriously halt the slide in rental values in retail land. After three upwards only decades, the market has turned.</p> <p>Neither side deserves to win this CVA fight, in other words. In the absence of an honourable victor, preserving jobs and securing even an underwhelming pensions deal (\u00a3175m of cash over three years, plus \u00a3210m of securities) should be the priority.

It\u2019s very different now the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority and the chair of the Treasury select committee are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/11/neil-woodford-fees-fca-equity-income-fund\">shouting at him</a> to waive fees on the gated Equity Income fund.</p> <p>The alternative explanation is Woodford somehow believes that, since the fund is still operating and he\u2019s probably working harder than ever, the fees are justified because investors are receiving a service.</p> <p>But, if that\u2019s his thinking, he needs to make a mental leap and look at life from the point of view of the poor old punters. Deprived of the option of cashing up and exiting the fund, they are being forced to pay for their own imprisonment. That\u2019s within the rules of the game \u2013 the possibility of gating is in the terms and conditions \u2013 but the moral case for waiving the fees is overwhelming.</p> <p>Remember, too, that Woodford Capital, the company 65% owned by Woodford and 35% by his business partner, has received \u00a397m since the fund management venture set out in 2014. The duo can afford to run the fund for free until the gates are removed. Even if the process takes six months, they\u2019d still be massively in the money.</p> <p>Nicky Morgan\u2019s committee may wish to summon Woodford to explain why a fee waiver hasn\u2019t appeared already. That might hurry up a U-turn that surely has to happen.</p> <h2>Deutsche Bahn can\u2019t railroad Arriva sale in UK</h2> <p>Deutsche Bahn has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/27/deutsche-bahn-to-sell-uk-rail-bus-operator-arriva\">under pressure to sell</a> Arriva for a while. The state-owned German railway is carrying too much debt and the UK-based bus and rail company, bought for \u00a31.5bn in 2010, is an obvious candidate for disposal. Reports by Reuters on Tuesday, citing internal documents, said a sale or flotation of Arriva is seen as the only way to meet investment budgets in Germany.</p> <p>Good luck in trying to float the business in London, though. Rail franchising is a mess, the threat of rail nationalisation under Labour is in the background and Arriva\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/06/northern-rail-industrial-action-called-off-after-conductor-guarantee\">troubles with strikes</a> on its Northern operation are fresh in the memory. Arriva also has non-UK operations but, even so, don\u2019t expect a rush of UK investors.</p>",

Such an argument would still be outrageous, of course. Green and his wife paid themselves a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 and could, in any subsequent year, have chosen to hand back some of their winnings to repair the pension deficit. Instead, they still cruise the Mediterranean in a superyacht. For parallel reasons, you see why Intu is furious. If it agrees rental concessions to a billionaire sunning himself in the waters off Monaco, what\u2019s it supposed to say to other tenants who would also like to pay less? On the other hand, Intu is kidding itself if it thinks it can seriously halt the slide in rental values in retail land. After three upwards only decades, the market has turned. Neither side deserves to win this CVA fight, in other words. In the absence of an honourable victor, preserving jobs and securing even an underwhelming pensions deal (\u00a3175m of cash over three years, plus \u00a3210m of securities) should be the priority. Best to allow Arcadia to limp on. Woodford\u2019s reserve needs a review Bloody-mindedness was a virtue for Neil Woodford in the good old days when he was beating up underperforming boards and refusing to follow investment fashion. It\u2019s very different now the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority and the chair of the Treasury select committee are shouting at him to waive fees on the gated Equity Income fund. The alternative explanation is Woodford somehow believes that, since the fund is still operating and he\u2019s probably working harder than ever, the fees are justified because investors are receiving a service. But, if that\u2019s his thinking, he needs to make a mental leap and look at life from the point of view of the poor old punters. Deprived of the option of cashing up and exiting the fund, they are being forced to pay for their own imprisonment. That\u2019s within the rules of the game \u2013 the possibility of gating is in the terms and conditions \u2013 but the moral case for waiving the fees is overwhelming. Remember, too, that Woodford Capital, the company 65% owned by Woodford and 35% by his business partner, has received \u00a397m since the fund management venture set out in 2014. The duo can afford to run the fund for free until the gates are removed. Even if the process takes six months, they\u2019d still be massively in the money. Nicky Morgan\u2019s committee may wish to summon Woodford to explain why a fee waiver hasn\u2019t appeared already. That might hurry up a U-turn that surely has to happen. Deutsche Bahn can\u2019t railroad Arriva sale in UK Deutsche Bahn has been under pressure to sell Arriva for a while. The state-owned German railway is carrying too much debt and the UK-based bus and rail company, bought for \u00a31.5bn in 2010, is an obvious candidate for disposal. Reports by Reuters on Tuesday, citing internal documents, said a sale or flotation of Arriva is seen as the only way to meet investment budgets in Germany. Good luck in trying to float the business in London, though. Rail franchising is a mess, the threat of rail nationalisation under Labour is in the background and Arriva\u2019s troubles with strikes on its Northern operation are fresh in the memory. Arriva also has non-UK operations but, even so, don\u2019t expect a rush of UK investors.",

What is the new bid to prevent no deal? Labour has tabled a cross-party motion that would hand control of the parliamentary agenda to MPs on Tuesday 25 June. If the motion passes, MPs will have the chance to introduce measures, including legislation, that could help avoid a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. Who is supporting the measure? The party will use an opposition day debate \u2013 scheduled for Wednesday \u2013 to attempt to pass the motion, which has the backing of opposition parties including the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Dems and the Greens. The Tory MP Oliver Letwin, a key mover behind bids to block no deal in March, has also pledged support. Why has Labour tabled this motion to set aside a date? Labour says the motion is the next step in parliament preventing no deal, putting in place a process to legislate against a new prime minister pursuing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The date of 25 June would ensure this process is in place before the end of the Tory leadership contest, and before MPs leave for parliament\u2019s summer recess. Does this motion prevent no deal? No, it does not do anything more than give more parliamentary time for MPs to find a legal route to stop no deal. It gains control of the Commons order paper on 25 June and will give priority to a debate on that day on legislation relating to Brexit. Parliament can then specify a future date to give consideration to legislation to help prevent no deal on 31 October, similar to the process parliament used prior to the 29 March deadline. Will Tories back the move? Letwin is the only Conservative name on the motion but it is understood to have support from remain-backing Tories including the former attorney general Dominic Grieve and the former Tory MP Nick Boles, who quit the party earlier this year. Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the hard-Brexit European Research Group, said Tories including Letwin were risking the chance of a general election that could result in the Conservatives being wiped out by the Brexit party. What could be done to stop no deal if the motion succeeds? There are no details about the plan yet and it remains the legal default that the UK will leave \u2013 deal or no deal \u2013 on 31 October. Some MPs, including the Lib Dem leadership candidate Ed Davey, have suggested making it the legal default that a prime minister should revoke article 50, rather than leave without an agreement.

Apparently our Defence Department can afford 12 new submarines to replace the six we never used and our treasurer believes we can afford to give away $300bn worth of tax cuts \u2013 but we can\u2019t afford to invest heavily in renewable energy. Yeah, right. I know, I know \u2013 I\u2019m falling into the \u201ctrap\u201d of accepting that there is a trade-off between the economy and the environment. And yes, I know that renewables are cheaper than coal and that building renewables will push energy prices down, not up. But I don\u2019t care. I know that it\u2019s cheap to tackle climate change, but I\u2019d be willing to do so even if it was expensive. The fact that it is cheap isn\u2019t the reason to do it. Offal is cheap, and I haven\u2019t eaten it in 40 years. Australia\u2019s national income is about the same size as Russia\u2019s, a country that can afford one of the world\u2019s largest military forces. We don\u2019t have a fleet of nuclear submarines, but we do have one of the lowest tax rates in the developed world. If we wanted to reduce emissions, we could. And if we wanted Australian industries to have cheap gas, they would have it. But we don\u2019t. Our elected governments want to subsidise new coalmines and coal-fired power stations, and they don\u2019t ever claim that doing so will be \u201cefficient\u201d or \u201cleast cost\u201d. They just want to do it, so they do. It\u2019s only progressives that fall for the least cost claptrap. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute",

      "bodyText": "Australia could cut greenhouse gas emissions halfway to its Paris agreement target, and save $7.7bn a year in bills, by adopting existing global standards on energy efficiency. From new hot water heaters to better standards for appliances, a new report has found Australia is missing an opportunity to \u201ceasily\u201d meet its emissions targets and fight the looming climate crisis. The report, from the Energy Efficiency Council (EEC), found that adopting the measures used in Germany would save the average Australian household $790 a year on power bills. It would also create 70,000 extra fulltime equivalent jobs \u2013 from advanced engineering to plumbing \u2013 as houses are fitted with new boilers, draught-sealing and new lights, and factories invest in efficient equipment. A YouGov survey commissioned by the EEC found that \u201cinvesting in energy efficiency\u201d is one of the most politically popular actions the government can take on the climate crisis \u2013 with more than 85% support among both Labor and Coalition voters. However, Australia is not on track to meet its target of a 40% increase in efficiency by 2030, according to the EEC\u2019s head of policy, Rob Murray-Leach. Since 2015, Australia has only improved an average of 0.7% a year, according to the EEC\u2019s figures \u2013 well below the 2.3% rate needed. Murray-Leach said the levers of change were controlled by the states and territories \u2013 meaning Australia could still \u201ccrack on\u201d even if the federal government was inactive. The report said Australians should start thinking of energy efficiency as a form of energy generation \u2013 adding capacity to the grid and reducing power bills. \u201cEnergy efficiency is just another form of supply,\u201d Murray-Leach said. \u201cWhen I look at Germany, their bills are 30% lower\u201d. According to the report, Australia has \u201cbarely begun to tap the potential of energy efficiency\u201d, and was the worst developed country for efficiency, out of the top 25 energy-consuming countries.

Australia currently has minimum standards set for 21 kinds of appliances \u2013 much less than our biggest trading partners, the US (with 51), the EU (41) and China (also 41). Simply matching those standards would boost trade as well as energy conservation, the report said. In the US, California also updates its building codes every three years to keep new buildings energy efficient. If Australia copied the same building codes as the US or Japan, an office building in Brisbane would be 20% more energy efficient, the report found. It also recommended that houses be given energy efficiency ratings in the same way appliances are, so new buyers and new renters can see how much money they would lose by choosing an energy inefficient home \u2013 a scheme the UK has had since 2007. \u201cThe research has shown you could easily double energy productivity \u2013 so a 100% improvement by 2040, instead of a 40% increase by 2040,\u201d Murray-Leach said. Californian energy commissioner Andrew Mcallister told Guardian Australia \u201cthere is a lot of low-hanging fruit in Australia, that in California we have already harvested\u201d. \u201cEnergy efficiency advocacy is not really a radical thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is rational, it is good policy.

At the National Press Club on Wednesday, Deloitte partner Chris Richardson will argue that improving technology is shifting the mix of skills in demand with employers but fears of mass unemployment are \u201centirely misplaced\u201d. In the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Richardson says despite technological change accelerating for decades, unemployment is \u201cclose to record lows around the world\u201d \u2013 including the US, UK and Australia. \u201cSo if you feared that new technologies would lead to mass unemployment \u2026 it just isn\u2019t happening. \u201cNew technologies are improving what workers do rather than replacing those workers overall.\u201d Richardson compares fears that robots will \u201csteal\u201d jobs with fears that migrants would do the same \u2013 or married women \u2013 in times past. \u201cBut new technologies create as many jobs as they kill,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the ones they kill are obvious, while the ones they create are hiding in plain sight.\u201d Richardson says the predicted trend of Australians having \u201cheaps of jobs\u201d over their career has not eventuated. \u201cAlmost half \u2013 45% of all workers in Australia \u2013 have been with their current employer more than five years. \u201cAnd the average Australian worker has been in their current job for almost five months longer than was true just a decade ago.\u201d Nor has work in the gig economy and working from home replaced traditional modes of employment, he says. \u201cFinally, you can\u2019t blame technology for the lack of wage growth in Australia and around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite that\u2019s true \u2026 better technologies make workers more valuable and that leads to them getting higher wages.\u201d Richardson cites the fact that countries with the most technology per worker also have the highest pay. He suggests that workers and employers are \u201cgetting more worried about what the future may bring\u201d and fear of the future \u201cmay well be one of the main reasons why wage growth isn\u2019t acting the same way that it used to\u201d. \u201cAll around the world a given level of unemployment is generating less by way of wage gains. That\u2019s partly because the rise of the robots \u2026 [has] workers more worried than they should be.\u201d Australia has experienced six years of well-below-average wage growth, although wages ticked up to annual growth of 2.3% in the last quarter. Research by the Australian National University has found there is \u201ca not insignificant minority of workers who worry about automation\u201d although this is \u201cless of a concern than other sources\u201d of displacement. It found that workers are more concerned about their employer finding someone overseas who is willing to perform their job for less money, with 14.8% very concerned by the prospect. On Wednesday Deloitte will release a report titled The Path to Prosperity: Why the Future of Work is Human, suggesting that in the future jobs will require fewer manual skills and more cognitive skills. More than 80% of jobs created between now and 2030 will be for knowledge workers, and two-thirds will be strongly reliant on soft skills, it says. The growing demand for workers performing \u201cnon-routine\u201d tasks with their heads as opposed to \u201croutine\u201d tasks with their hands will see the most jobs growth in female-dominated industries. Australian science agency the CSIRO has suggested that automation of low-skilled jobs will leave human workers free to do more complex jobs, with titles such as remote-controlled vehicle operators or online chaperones. Richardson suggests the government should help workers fill their skills gaps through measures including lifelong learning. He also warns against \u201cpolicy mistakes\u201d such as attempting to impose a tax on robots as proposed by Bill Gates and in Europe, arguing such a measure would \u201csimply lower wage gains\u201d.",

Imagine that the previously cautious, passive or politically conservative came out, including lawyers and church congregations. Then imagine that \u2013 even with further protests pending \u2013 the government said they just didn\u2019t understand the issue, and vowed to ram through changes within days.</p> <p>This is what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/hong-kong-businesses-vow-to-strike-as-anger-over-extradition-bill-grows\" title=\"\">Hong Kong has just seen</a>. As many as a million residents, equivalent to one in seven of the population, marched against extradition changes. The turnout, astounding even to organisers, reflected the understanding that these amendments are the latest and most decisive breach of China\u2019s commitment to maintain Hong Kong\u2019s way of life for 50 years after its handover from Britain in 1997. By removing the firewall between the legal systems, the changes expose both Hong Kong residents and those who travel there to the whims of the Chinese Communist party, which controls the mainland\u2019s courts and is handy at mustering convenient legal cases.</p> <p>The pretext for the changes is the need to address a murder case in Taiwan, which <a href=\"https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1460284-20190531.htm\" title=\"\">would not in fact be resolved</a> by them. Whatever the Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, says, the assumption is that the extradition changes, which would allow the accused to be transferred to the mainland without legislative oversight, are designed to suit Beijing. Opponents predict the law will be used against critics, and potentially much more widely \u2013 perhaps against people caught in commercial disputes \u2013 and point to the cases of a bookseller and a tycoon who had foreign passports but were kidnapped from Hong Kong.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the protests will continue, with walkouts by school and university students, bus drivers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-extradition.html\" title=\"\">going slow</a> and a sit-in near government buildings. Hundreds of businesses, including bakeries and toy shops, have said they will shut. </p> <p>Most are realistic about their prospects of success. Last Sunday\u2019s demonstrations were probably the biggest since the handover, and certainly since 2003, when rallies led to the shelving of draconian national security laws. But the protests are a sign of desperation more than hope: a visceral expression of fear, anger and pride in Hong Kong\u2019s identity. Denied a meaningful electoral say by their very limited form of democracy, many want to vote with their feet. According to one survey, one in three Hong Kong residents, and one in two young people, <a href=\"https://www.cpr.cuhk.edu.hk/en/press_detail.php?id=2947&amp;t=survey-findings-on-views-on-emigration-from-hong-kong-released-by-hong-kong-institute-of-asia-pacific-studies-at-cuhk&amp;id=2947&amp;t=survey-findings-on-views-on-emigration-from-hong-kong-released-by-hong-kong-institute-of-asia-pacific-studies-at-cuhk\" title=\"\">want to emigrate</a>, with political issues among the top push factors.</p> <p>Since Ms Lam insists this is a local initiative, Beijing could, in theory, shelve the proposals and let her deal with the consequences. In reality, this would allow Beijing to carry on abducting those it really wants, probably to minimal protest. Foreign companies would be reassured: Hong Kong\u2019s economic importance to China is much diminished, but with international businesses unsettled by the trade war, it may be more valuable than in recent years. </p> <p>Under Xi Jinping the mainland has seen ever-increasing repression, and since 2014\u2019s peaceful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/09/hong-kong-umbrella-movement-protesters-guilty-over-pro-democracy-rallies-jail\" title=\"\">umbrella protests</a> the Hong Kong authorities have made clear their determination to crush any sign of opposition. They have disqualified a growing number of candidates, banned a political party peacefully promoting independence, and ousted elected representatives. They have prosecuted dozens of pro-democracy leaders. Absurdly, a law professor who co-founded the 2014 movement has been sent to a maximum security prison. Independent bookstores have closed and others have stopped selling works critical of China. A draft law criminalises disrespecting the Chinese national anthem.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Beijing has shown its contempt for opinion in Hong Kong and abroad. It has described the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration on the return of Hong Kong as no longer of \u201cany practical significance\u201d. Some might conclude further representations are pointless. But Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrators have made their stand regardless of the outcome, and they deserve support. Beijing\u2019s attitude is all the more reason for leaders overseas, and especially in Britain, to urge it to respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy in clear and forceful terms.</p>",

This is what Hong Kong has just seen. As many as a million residents, equivalent to one in seven of the population, marched against extradition changes. The turnout, astounding even to organisers, reflected the understanding that these amendments are the latest and most decisive breach of China\u2019s commitment to maintain Hong Kong\u2019s way of life for 50 years after its handover from Britain in 1997. By removing the firewall between the legal systems, the changes expose both Hong Kong residents and those who travel there to the whims of the Chinese Communist party, which controls the mainland\u2019s courts and is handy at mustering convenient legal cases. The pretext for the changes is the need to address a murder case in Taiwan, which would not in fact be resolved by them. Whatever the Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, says, the assumption is that the extradition changes, which would allow the accused to be transferred to the mainland without legislative oversight, are designed to suit Beijing. Opponents predict the law will be used against critics, and potentially much more widely \u2013 perhaps against people caught in commercial disputes \u2013 and point to the cases of a bookseller and a tycoon who had foreign passports but were kidnapped from Hong Kong. On Wednesday, the protests will continue, with walkouts by school and university students, bus drivers going slow and a sit-in near government buildings. Hundreds of businesses, including bakeries and toy shops, have said they will shut. Most are realistic about their prospects of success. Last Sunday\u2019s demonstrations were probably the biggest since the handover, and certainly since 2003, when rallies led to the shelving of draconian national security laws. But the protests are a sign of desperation more than hope: a visceral expression of fear, anger and pride in Hong Kong\u2019s identity. Denied a meaningful electoral say by their very limited form of democracy, many want to vote with their feet. According to one survey, one in three Hong Kong residents, and one in two young people, want to emigrate, with political issues among the top push factors. Since Ms Lam insists this is a local initiative, Beijing could, in theory, shelve the proposals and let her deal with the consequences. In reality, this would allow Beijing to carry on abducting those it really wants, probably to minimal protest. Foreign companies would be reassured: Hong Kong\u2019s economic importance to China is much diminished, but with international businesses unsettled by the trade war, it may be more valuable than in recent years. Under Xi Jinping the mainland has seen ever-increasing repression, and since 2014\u2019s peaceful umbrella protests the Hong Kong authorities have made clear their determination to crush any sign of opposition. They have disqualified a growing number of candidates, banned a political party peacefully promoting independence, and ousted elected representatives. They have prosecuted dozens of pro-democracy leaders. Absurdly, a law professor who co-founded the 2014 movement has been sent to a maximum security prison. Independent bookstores have closed and others have stopped selling works critical of China. A draft law criminalises disrespecting the Chinese national anthem. Meanwhile, Beijing has shown its contempt for opinion in Hong Kong and abroad. It has described the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration on the return of Hong Kong as no longer of \u201cany practical significance\u201d. Some might conclude further representations are pointless. But Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrators have made their stand regardless of the outcome, and they deserve support. Beijing\u2019s attitude is all the more reason for leaders overseas, and especially in Britain, to urge it to respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy in clear and forceful terms.",

      "bodyText": "Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson recommended that the UK allow Saudi Arabia to buy British bomb parts expected to be deployed in Yemen, days after an airstrike on a potato factory in the country had killed 14 people in 2016. Campaigners accused the then foreign secretary of showing a \u201ctotal disregard\u201d for Yemeni civilians by allowing the sales, revealed for the first time in emails disclosed via a freedom of information request. A day after the sale was recommended for approval by Johnson in August 2016, a village school in Yemen was hit by another deadly airstrike, prompting further complaints that the UK is complicit in breaches of international humanitarian law. UK arms controls mean that the foreign secretary has to be consulted on whether the Department for International Trade should licence \u201cprecision guided weapons systems and munitions that are likely to be used by the Saudi Royal Air Force in Yemen\u201d. An email dated 12 August 2016 to the Export Control Joint Unit, responsible for licensing UK arms deals, says that Johnson \u201cwas content\u201d to advise that the licensing of components for Paveway bombs should go ahead. A few days earlier, on 9 August, the Saudi-led coalition resumed airstrikes on Sana\u2019a at the end of a ceasefire that had held since April. Reports at the time said that more than half of those killed in the strike were women. Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade accused the Conservative MP of showing a lack of compassion: \u201cFor Boris Johnson to approve a missile sale the day after a food factory was destroyed shows the total disregard that he and his colleagues hold for the rights and lives of Yemeni people.\u201d A day after the approval email was sent, on 13 August, a village school in the Sa\u2019ada province was hit by an airstrike, which killed 10 children and injured 20. The then cabinet minister has previously defended the arms sales during his time in office, saying in September 2016 that Saudi-led bombing campaign is not \u201cin clear breach\u201d of international humanitarian law. Previously disclosures show that Johnson also assented to arms sales to Saudi Arabia in November 2016, the month after a funeral was bombed in Sana\u2019a and dozens killed. The UK is estimated to have licensed the sale of over \u00a34.7bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia since bombing began in March 2015. The Gulf nation has been the largest buyer of British-made arms for decades. The correspondence shows that the Foreign Office\u2019s Arms Policy Export Team has a duty to advise whether \u201cthere is a clear risk that these exports might be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law\u201d. Officials in the export team concluded that \u201cthis clear risk test has not been met\u201d in an email dated 10 August. In another email, dated 27 July, the Export Team declare: \u201cWe have increased confidence in the Saudi pre-planned and dynamic targeting processes.\u201d That was criticised by the academic who originally obtained the emails, following a 20-month battle, Dr Anna Stavrianakis, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Sussex. The academic said: \u201cComing days after an attack on a food factory, this information that suggests \u2018increased confidence\u2019 in Saudi processes is at odds with events on the ground.\u201d The court of appeal is deciding on a claim brought by the Campaign Against Arms Trade against the legality of the export of UK arms to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen. The high court had determined such sales were legal in July 2017, but two judges said that could be challenged in the higher court. The Saudi-led coalition has been repeatedly accused of bombing indiscriminately during the Yemeni civil war, which is targeting Houthis and allied rebel groups backing the former president of Yemen, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh. Peace talks have led to a partial ceasefire. Jeremy Hunt, who took over as foreign secretary in July 2018, and another Tory leadership contender, has defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, arguing that halting them would be \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d because the UK would \u201csurrender our influence\u201d.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Those who have worked on the plan include leading former and current Conservatives including Nick Boles and Dominic Grieve.</p> \n<p>A similar move in April by Letwin and the Labour MP Yvette Cooper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/mps-pass-motion-to-debate-article-50-extension-by-one-vote\">passed by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/03/mps-pass-motion-to-debate-article-50-extension-by-one-vote\">one vote</a> after 14 Tory MPs rebelled.

Several MPs who spoke out in the tense meeting had not publicly criticised the Labour leader previously, including Marie Rimmer, who told the meeting she had found it difficult to vote Labour, and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who argued for a members\u2019 ballot on a change of policy and said senior staff determining Labour\u2019s strategy should not be exempt from criticism. The Labour MP Anna Turley said the meeting was \u201cmessy and difficult\u201d. \u201cThe cleaners are probably still mopping up the blood on the carpet,\u201d she said. Turley, who backs a second referendum, told the BBC: \u201cOur results have not been going how we want and we have to be honest about that. It\u2019s no good pretending everything\u2019s fine while the Tories implode. W we are not in the position that we should be and we\u2019ve got to do better.\u201d",

In a sign the costs of an unresolved Brexit situation are mounting across the board, cabinet members clashed on Tuesday over whether it was necessary to plough more money into preparations for the possibility of leaving without a deal in October. Javid requested the money to pay for police and border staff who were hired in large numbers before the last March deadline and have been kept on in case they are needed later in the year. Almost all of the Conservative leadership contestants have, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, insisted that a no-deal Brexit must remain a possibility. There was, however, no agreement at cabinet to step up any spending on a no-deal scenario, despite demands from Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, to bolster preparations. It is understood Javid has now formally written to the Treasury asking for between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn in extra funding for the Home Office. Despite the promises of some candidates for the Conservative leadership to take the UK out of the EU at the end of October, it is unlikely Hammond will look on Javid\u2019s demand favourably. The Treasury allocated at least \u00a3500m to the department when \u00a32bn of Brexit preparation spending was shared across Whitehall. A source with knowledge of the meeting said: \u201cThe home secretary raised the need for additional police and border force no-deal funding. The chancellor\u2019s response and Liz Truss\u2019s was that we\u2019ve not had this bid in and it would be looked at if there is a genuine need, but it would be quite surprising given the Treasury has already released Brexit funding \u2013 of which the Home Office got the largest part \u2013 so they shouldn\u2019t have run out by now.\u201d Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, who is supporting Jeremy Hunt\u2019s leadership bid, was among those understood to have argued against increasing spending on the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, saying public services should be a greater priority. Theresa May also told the leadership contenders who are prepared to allow a no-deal exit that parliament is unlikely to stand for it. She told cabinet her successor would have the same problem that she did \u2013 that there were as many Conservative MPs willing to stop a no deal as there were colleagues who would vote down her deal. During the lengthy meeting, tensions also rose when the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, said it was not illegal to prorogue parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit, citing precedent. He did, however, stress that it would be unconstitutional and inadvisable to do so. The extent of no-deal preparations has been a controversy for months after the UK failed to leave the EU at the end of March. May stood down Operation Yellowhammer, the government\u2019s contingency planning operation for dealing with the worst-case scenarios resulting from a no-deal Brexit, after that point. Staff who had been seconded from elsewhere were returned to their normal duties, but there was no clear role for an estimated 4,500 new recruits. About 16,000 civil servants have been redeployed or recruited to fill Brexit-related posts. May later wrote to civil servants to tell them that some no-deal preparations would have to carry on, and that plans for crashing out of the EU were necessary and would continue to be signed off by permanent secretaries. Barclay has been a vocal supporter in cabinet of continuing to spend money on no-deal preparations, but others have argued that is wasteful given that parliament will not let it happen.",

She went ahead anyway \u2013 and there are now about 100 waste authorities in London. Francis was also an expert on the buses, tubes and railway systems of London Transport and it was often easier to ask him than to consult a timetable.</p> <p>He was born in Finchley, north-west London, the eldest of three children of Christopher Jones, who worked for the London county council, and his wife, Kathleen (nee Robinson), and went to Clifton college in Bristol, then Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, where he studied modern languages.</p> <p>His life in London, with visits to theatres and museums, was interrupted by the second world war, during which he spent time in army training camps and then in North Africa and Italy with the Royal Artillery. </p> <p>His poor eyesight (he was already wearing glasses in photographs taken in his pram) did not impair his ability to calculate the range and bearing for the guns. His family were surprised that the army did not make use of his fluent French and German, but Francis was good at keeping a low profile. He asked us not to mention his war record at his funeral but we did, because we are proud of his achievements.</p> <p>After demob, he tried teaching languages, but his poor sight and increasing deafness made this difficult and finally Francis settled happily in the LCC, at first as a clerical officer, then rising through the ranks in the chief engineer\u2019s department, and later transferring to its successor organisation, the GLC, from where he retired in 1981.</p> <p>Colleagues testified to his efficiency and hard work and, once discovered, his sense of humour, unceasing interest in politics and love of London.</p> <p>His hobbies were travel in Europe, where he visited friends, Mensa, \u201clethal\u201d Scrabble and volunteering at Oxfam. He would bombard his MP with letters, and family and friends all over the world will miss his letters and telephone calls, and, more recently, emails. He was a Guardian reader to the end, in very large print on his computer. </p> <p>He is survived by four nieces, Helen, Ruth, Catherine and me, and a nephew, Richard; and by three great-nieces and seven great-nephews.</p>",

He was born in Finchley, north-west London, the eldest of three children of Christopher Jones, who worked for the London county council, and his wife, Kathleen (nee Robinson), and went to Clifton college in Bristol, then Queen\u2019s College, Oxford, where he studied modern languages. His life in London, with visits to theatres and museums, was interrupted by the second world war, during which he spent time in army training camps and then in North Africa and Italy with the Royal Artillery. His poor eyesight (he was already wearing glasses in photographs taken in his pram) did not impair his ability to calculate the range and bearing for the guns. His family were surprised that the army did not make use of his fluent French and German, but Francis was good at keeping a low profile. He asked us not to mention his war record at his funeral but we did, because we are proud of his achievements. After demob, he tried teaching languages, but his poor sight and increasing deafness made this difficult and finally Francis settled happily in the LCC, at first as a clerical officer, then rising through the ranks in the chief engineer\u2019s department, and later transferring to its successor organisation, the GLC, from where he retired in 1981. Colleagues testified to his efficiency and hard work and, once discovered, his sense of humour, unceasing interest in politics and love of London. His hobbies were travel in Europe, where he visited friends, Mensa, \u201clethal\u201d Scrabble and volunteering at Oxfam. He would bombard his MP with letters, and family and friends all over the world will miss his letters and telephone calls, and, more recently, emails. He was a Guardian reader to the end, in very large print on his computer. He is survived by four nieces, Helen, Ruth, Catherine and me, and a nephew, Richard; and by three great-nieces and seven great-nephews.",

If you make art and put it in the public domain you have to be prepared to take the brickbats. But what he got wrong was the notion that when you get older as an artist you become \u201cexhausted\u201d.</p> <p>Two of my fellow Royal Academicians in this year\u2019s show have made astonishing works in their 90s. Joe Tilson presents a magnificent stained-glass work for which he won the Charles Wollaston prize. Anthony Eyton has painted a beautiful image of light falling down a staircase in his London home, and this week is his 96th birthday. In their 80s, Olwyn Bowey presents her beautiful homage to Van Gogh and in gallery 8 I have hung a masterpiece: an ambitious evocation of light and debris by Frank Bowling, who currently has a widely praised retrospective at Tate Britain.</p> <p>As artists grow older they can fall from fashion, but age also brings gravitas if we have the imagination to see it. Michelangelo began the Sistine chapel at the height of his powers, but finished it at the end of his life. The great thing about the summer show is that it is a chance to look at all the art being made in Britain. At any one moment artists are talking about light, landscape, politics and pattern. You can attack it for being a \u201cfruit salad\u201d, but I prefer to celebrate its democracy. Long live the old artist: we will all be there one day.</p> <p>Tilson went to art school only after he had served three years in the RAF, at the end of the second world war. Opposite a work of his I have hung one by his granddaughter, who recently graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art. It reflects some of his energy \u2013 it\u2019s about appropriation and pop imagery.

      "bodyText": "Regarding Jonathan Jones\u2019s review (6 June) of the Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition, where he spent a great deal of it attacking me (\u201cthe poor person\u2019s [Grayson] Perry\u201d), I don\u2019t really mind. If you make art and put it in the public domain you have to be prepared to take the brickbats. But what he got wrong was the notion that when you get older as an artist you become \u201cexhausted\u201d. Two of my fellow Royal Academicians in this year\u2019s show have made astonishing works in their 90s. Joe Tilson presents a magnificent stained-glass work for which he won the Charles Wollaston prize. Anthony Eyton has painted a beautiful image of light falling down a staircase in his London home, and this week is his 96th birthday. In their 80s, Olwyn Bowey presents her beautiful homage to Van Gogh and in gallery 8 I have hung a masterpiece: an ambitious evocation of light and debris by Frank Bowling, who currently has a widely praised retrospective at Tate Britain. As artists grow older they can fall from fashion, but age also brings gravitas if we have the imagination to see it. Michelangelo began the Sistine chapel at the height of his powers, but finished it at the end of his life. The great thing about the summer show is that it is a chance to look at all the art being made in Britain. At any one moment artists are talking about light, landscape, politics and pattern. You can attack it for being a \u201cfruit salad\u201d, but I prefer to celebrate its democracy. Long live the old artist: we will all be there one day. Tilson went to art school only after he had served three years in the RAF, at the end of the second world war. Opposite a work of his I have hung one by his granddaughter, who recently graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art. It reflects some of his energy \u2013 it\u2019s about appropriation and pop imagery. Call me what you want, Mr Jones, but they do not deserve to be called moronic and are certainly far from exhausted.

Advisers are called \u201ccoaches\u201d, to mirror the real world, and they can help with the nuts and bolts of networking, building a personal brand through to rootling out job vacancies \u2013 more than 6,000 graduate jobs and internships were advertised by the university last year. Each academic faculty contains experts with knowledge of particular jobs markets and skills in demand, and industry speakers will visit to give talks. \u201cCareers support is embedded in departments and across campuses,\u201d says Jamie Jordan, a forensic science graduate who now works within the career services. Students might ask for guidance on navigating the jobs market, finding postgraduate options or selling their skills to potential employers. A recently launched UWE Bristol app, Career Toolkit, allows students to do all of this online if they prefer, and provides hundreds of learning videos and tools such as psychometric testing, CV advice and interview simulations. Rarely will any student graduate from UWE Bristol without any work experience \u2013 the university helps broker a wealth of industry placements and work-related learning. Students undertook more than 9,200 work placements last year \u2013 and some departments, such as environment and technology, encourage a full year in industry. \u201cEveryone knows the graduate market is tough. It\u2019s definitely worth doing more than just your course at university,\u201d says Newton. And when a student returns from an internship, year in industry or studying overseas, you can see the difference, says Lucy Madahar, deputy director of student success services. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a transformation. They return more confident, resilient and with more self-esteem,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have developed a work ethic. We have data that shows a direct link between experience in industry and securing a graduate level job, even an improvement in degree results.\u201d UWE Bristol prides itself on contacts with employers and, crucially, the inside track on who\u2019s hiring and when. A dedicated team work with employers and help secure placements, and the university helps prepare students for the world of work with workshops and advice before their work experience. \u201cAnything so that they can feel confident \u2013 from what to wear through to business etiquette,\u201d says Madahar. Students within arts and creative industries generally complete shorter internships, some with Bristol\u2019s creative and television industries \u2013 in the past they\u2019ve found work with the likes of Bristol Old Vic Theatre, BBC Earth and independent television studios. Some 200 employers attended UWE Bristol\u2019s latest annual employers\u2019 fair, the biggest in the south west. In total, more than 630 recruiters have visited campus in the past year, and the university works with large companies such as Santander, the Ministry of Defence, Airbus, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Enterprise Rent-a-Car and PeopleScout. UWE Bristol programmes result in \u201csome of the best emerging graduate talent\u201d, says a spokesperson from government body Defence Equipment and Support, which offers industrial placements to UWE Bristol students. \u201cWe also work with hundreds of small businesses, who often want to work with students on live briefs,\u201d says Madahar. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for all parties.\u201d Students with an urge to travel can volunteer or work abroad \u2013 the university has offered about 500 global work and volunteering opportunities. Specialist staff can also help students navigate their way around the vast voluntary sector \u2013 with strict criteria enforced by the university to prevent exploitation. \u201cAnd UWE Bristol helps broker study abroad, sometimes with financial support. We have more than 100 students signed up to take part in the Erasmus (study abroad) programme in 2019/20, with costs being covered as usual. Beyond then, we\u2019ll have to see what Brexit brings,\u201d says Madahar. Students from low-income families or those who\u2019ve been in care are also supported, she says, with a scheme that provides mentorship to build self-confidence. Another student programme, Equity, focuses on supporting black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) students with coaching and mentoring. Over the past four years, the number of UWE Bristol students using careers services has continued to rise. \u201cSo we know the message is getting through,\u201d says Newton. \u201cWhat we offer is unique.\u201d",

All of the opportunities you\u2019ve taken advantage of during your student days, and the lessons you\u2019ve learned, will help you to make your next steps \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to think about all that you\u2019ve achieved while at university and let that guide your next move.",

Foxconn, one of Apple\u2019s largest suppliers, has moved to reassure consumers and investors that prices and supplies of the Apple\u2019s iPhone will not be affected by the ongoing US-China tariff war. According to a senior executive at Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn, the company has more than enough capacity to make all iPhones bound for the US outside of China if necessary. \u201cTwenty-five percent of our production capacity is outside of China and we can help Apple respond to its needs in the US market,\u201d said Young Liu, Hon Hai\u2019s semiconductor division chief, at an investor briefing in Taipei. At the briefing \u2013 which was first reported by Bloomberg \u2013 Liu said the company was investing in India, where several older iPhone models are already made at a plant in Bangalore. \u201cWe have enough capacity to meet Apple\u2019s demand,\u201d Liu added. China is the source of most of Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads as well as its largest international market. Apple\u2019s production in China has become a major concern for investors as the Trump administration escalates threats to hit Beijing with new tariffs on about $300bn worth of Chinese goods. In his comments to investors, Liu said Apple had not given Hon Hai instructions to move production out of China. But he said the company is capable of moving production lines elsewhere according to customers\u2019 needs. Still, the vulnerability of tech assemblers and chip manufacturers to the trade war has already been established. Earlier this month, US semiconductor shares plummeted after the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei, the Chinese manufacturing giant accused of breaking sanctions on Iran and being a potential source of espionage for Beijing.",

      "bodyText": "Children recruited to spy on drug dealers, gangs, terrorists and paedophiles have fewer safeguards when handled by investigators than those arrested for minor offences such as shoplifting, the high court has heard. At a judicial review hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, campaigners challenging the use of children as covert human intelligence sources (CHISs) argued the lack of safeguards violates children\u2019s human rights and puts them at risk of severe harm. Introducing the case against the Home Office on Tuesday, Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, acting for Just for Kids Law, told Mr Justice Michael Supperstone that safeguards for children recruited as CHISs were inadequate. \u201cThis case concerns children who may be recruited and deployed as CHIS in the most extreme circumstances,\u201d Gallagher said, referring in particular to one case revealed in a House of Lords debate of a 17-year-old girl recruited to spy on a man who was selling her for sex. Gallagher said: \u201cA justification put forward is that some children are involved in or in close proximity to serious crimes which they could as a covert source help police to investigate and prosecute. \u201cThat justification also demonstrates the acute need for stringent safeguards: keeping a child close to serious crimes may serve a compelling public interest, but it would appear to be antithetical to the child\u2019s own interests.\u201d Seventeen children have been recruited as covert sources since January 2015 \u2013 including one just 15 at the time \u2013 according to figures released by the investigatory powers commissioner in March. The powers under which they are used have existed for nearly two decades, but they came to light only last summer after a House of Lords committee raised the alarm over proposals to make recruitment and deployment easier. Ministers had sought to increase the length of time that child spies could be deployed before re-authorisation from one month to four, and to broaden the range of people who could act as an \u201cappropriate adult\u201d when being interviewed with police. The new rules came into effect shortly after. Just for Kids Law\u2019s judicial review hinges on a claim that the rules governing the use of child spies fail to comply with the home secretary\u2019s obligations to comply with article 8 of the Human Rights Act \u2013 guaranteeing children\u2019s right to a private or family life \u2013 and article 3.1 of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child \u2013 stipulating that the interests of the child should be a top priority in all decisions and actions that affect them. Gallagher warned that the extension of the length of time a child spy could be authorised had come about for the \u201cadministrative convenience of the authorities concerned.\u201d Because the orders involve covert operations, officers are not required to check with other agencies about vulnerability, histories of domestic abuse or mental health issues of the child spies. \u201cThe decision is made in a very closed circle,\u201d she said. The court heard evidence from Neil Woods, a former police officer who spent years undercover investigating drugs gangs, that such work posed the risk of severe physical and psychological harm to young people. In a written statement read out in court, Woods said he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his experiences undercover with drugs gangs, which included proximity to extreme violence, including torture and maimings of those considered to be working with police. \u201cI developed the ability to suppress my emotions at times of great stress when I was witnessing very grave things,\u201d Woods said in his statement. \u201cIt causes me great concern that a child could be asked to maintain a lie for any length of time and suffer the psychological harm that I have suffered \u2026 I question the legitimacy in allowing police to recruit child spies at a time when police are just beginning to recognise the lasting harm caused to adults in doing the same thing.\u201d Sir James Eadie QC, responding on behalf of the home secretary, emphasised the many layers of approvals and safeguards involved in recruiting children as CHISs. The hearing lasted one day and Supperstone reserved his judgment, which he will hand down at a later date.",

USA!! USA!!! at the Women\u2019s World Cup. But still, this is football. Funny old game, etc and so forth. \u201cOf course,\u201d Thai defender Warunee Petchwiset said, \u201cwe want to score against [USA! USA!!

      "body": "<p>For decades now, social mobility has been feted as the answer to society\u2019s ills. Conservatives have always <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/damian-hinds-defends-50m-grammar-schools-fund\" title=\"\">embraced</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/11/damian-hinds-defends-50m-grammar-schools-fund\" title=\"\"> the idea of grammar schools</a> \u2013 that giving a top tier education to bright children from working class backgrounds provides them with the opportunities their middle class counterparts take for granted. And from the mid-1990s, the Labour party shifted its emphasis from equality of outcome to equality of opportunity and raising aspiration.</p> <p>Social mobility has proven seductive to all sides of politics for two reasons. It is difficult to argue against: shouldn\u2019t smart but disadvantaged kids be offered the opportunity to fulfil their potential? And the beneficiaries of schemes that pluck individuals from impoverished backgrounds and help them climb the social ladder tend to place great stall in their own backstory, and defend the system vociferously.</p> <p>So Labour\u2019s decision to break with this era of embracing social mobility will meet some resistance. Jeremy Corbyn announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/jeremy-corbyn-to-drop-social-mobility-as-labour-goal\" title=\"\">last weekend</a> that the party would be pursuing social justice for all instead of social mobility, and would replace the Social Mobility Commission with a body that measures progress against equality targets.</p> <p>Social mobility has always been a slippery term, with nebulous markers of success: how many state school children have to achieve postgraduate degrees, or fill higher professional jobs, before society is deemed to have achieved the requisite degree of mobility to consider prejudice or injustice a thing of the past? </p> <p>What makes it so enticing is that it is so unthreatening to the status quo. A few people from the lower echelons are allowed to rise through the ranks and achieve more than their parents or grandparents, but the class constraints of wider society remain entrenched: the senior ranks of the legal profession continue to be made up of predominantly private school alumni, even though only 7% of the population <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/24/privately-educated-elite-continues-to-take-top-jobs-finds-survey\" title=\"\">go to fee-paying schools</a>.</p> <p>Funding schemes that concentrate on a few children from state schools have a good success rate because the stakes are so low: the \u201cgifted and talented\u201d scheme introduced by the Labour government in 2002, then scrapped in 2010, identified children who were performing well, then claimed success when they went on to achieve good grades. Ditto grammar schools: by filtering children through exams at the end of primary school, they can ensure they accept children who are likely to perform well regardless. Their high success rate is not because they boost the majority of children, but because they pre-select a small number of high-ability children.</p> <p>Progressing beyond social mobility means accepting a hard truth: what makes social mobility so popular is it plays into the idea that a handful of people are deserving of greater success because they have worked hard and are preternaturally talented. Removing some barriers to their success is seen as the answer to our strict and constraining class structure. Such thinking implies that the vast bulk of the working class are stuck with low wages and a precarious financial future because they haven\u2019t worked hard enough to free themselves.

      "bodyText": "For decades now, social mobility has been feted as the answer to society\u2019s ills. Conservatives have always embraced the idea of grammar schools \u2013 that giving a top tier education to bright children from working class backgrounds provides them with the opportunities their middle class counterparts take for granted. And from the mid-1990s, the Labour party shifted its emphasis from equality of outcome to equality of opportunity and raising aspiration. Social mobility has proven seductive to all sides of politics for two reasons. It is difficult to argue against: shouldn\u2019t smart but disadvantaged kids be offered the opportunity to fulfil their potential? And the beneficiaries of schemes that pluck individuals from impoverished backgrounds and help them climb the social ladder tend to place great stall in their own backstory, and defend the system vociferously. So Labour\u2019s decision to break with this era of embracing social mobility will meet some resistance. Jeremy Corbyn announced last weekend that the party would be pursuing social justice for all instead of social mobility, and would replace the Social Mobility Commission with a body that measures progress against equality targets. Social mobility has always been a slippery term, with nebulous markers of success: how many state school children have to achieve postgraduate degrees, or fill higher professional jobs, before society is deemed to have achieved the requisite degree of mobility to consider prejudice or injustice a thing of the past? What makes it so enticing is that it is so unthreatening to the status quo. A few people from the lower echelons are allowed to rise through the ranks and achieve more than their parents or grandparents, but the class constraints of wider society remain entrenched: the senior ranks of the legal profession continue to be made up of predominantly private school alumni, even though only 7% of the population go to fee-paying schools. Funding schemes that concentrate on a few children from state schools have a good success rate because the stakes are so low: the \u201cgifted and talented\u201d scheme introduced by the Labour government in 2002, then scrapped in 2010, identified children who were performing well, then claimed success when they went on to achieve good grades. Ditto grammar schools: by filtering children through exams at the end of primary school, they can ensure they accept children who are likely to perform well regardless. Their high success rate is not because they boost the majority of children, but because they pre-select a small number of high-ability children. Progressing beyond social mobility means accepting a hard truth: what makes social mobility so popular is it plays into the idea that a handful of people are deserving of greater success because they have worked hard and are preternaturally talented. Removing some barriers to their success is seen as the answer to our strict and constraining class structure. Such thinking implies that the vast bulk of the working class are stuck with low wages and a precarious financial future because they haven\u2019t worked hard enough to free themselves. It presupposes too that the working class is something to be escaped, further stigmatising the social experience of millions across the United Kingdom, and ensuring for those supposed social \u201csuccess stories\u201d the journey into the middle classes is an endlessly lonely experience. Far harder is the pursuit of actual equality and justice: building a much better education system for all children. It means addressing health inequalities, and funding public health initiatives that address lower life expectancies, higher cancer and heart disease rates, higher infant mortality and suicide rates in different regions. It means making sure people have the opportunity to earn a decent wage and the right to request flexible working and better conditions. One of the big problems with social mobility is that people are only ever comfortable with the mobility travelling one way \u2013 a handful of working class people permitted entry to the managerial classes if they offer an inspirational enough story and continue to tug their forelocks - but the rich have never been as comfortable with the idea that their offspring might be best suited to working in a supermarket. Any attempt to redress the inequities and injustices that plague our society has to start with the reality that we will never live in a genuine meritocracy as long as the wealthy are able to protect their own interests. Even now, as Oxford and Cambridge ever so slowly allow more state-schooled children into their colleges, the most expensive private schools are screaming blue murder. The most radical proposals will be the ones that are met with the most resistance: addressing the core tenets of social injustice involves a much greater upheaval. \u2022 Dawn Foster is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2019 to clarify that it is the senior ranks of the legal profession that are made up of predominantly privately educated people, not the industry as a whole.",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with Kieran Pender\u2019s match report. Bye! Jill Roord\u2019s late goal means the Netherlands join Canada at the top of Group E. They deserved the breakthrough after dominating the majority of the second half. New Zealand defended well but they didn\u2019t take the few chances that come their way and were stung by one loss of concentration in the dying moments. What a crucial win for the Dutch. Van Dongen sends a deep cross in from the left. Beerensteyn makes a nuisance of herself at the far post. Her header loops into the air, Nayler is nowhere to be seen and Jill Roord, just on as substitute, sends a downward header into the net from three yards out. They\u2019ve done it! 90 min+1: There will be four added minutes. 90 min: New Zealand are almost there. 87 min: Beerensteyn replaces Van de Sanden. 85 min: New Zealand remain camped in their own half. They settled for a point long ago. 82 min: Spitser has a shot. Blocked. Then Miedema has one. Blocked. The pressure is relentless now. 80 min: Miedema turns in the area and wins another corner. It comes to nothing. 79 min: A corner to Holland on the left. It\u2019s aimed to the far post and Miedema heads over. 77 min: Satchell bustles through on the right, but her touch is poor, forcing her wide, and she dribbles a shot into the side netting. 74 min: New Zealand make two more changes, Wilkinson on for White, Satchell on for the profligate Gregorius. 72 min: Erceg adjusts just in time to flick a cross away from the lurking Miedema. It\u2019s been all Holland in the last 20 minutes. They\u2019re banging on the door. 70 min: Van Dongen replaces Van Es. 68 min: Van Lunteren crashes one over from 25 yards. 67 min: Longo replaces Hassett. 66 min: Van Lunteren dashes to the byline and pulls the ball back to Miedema, who crashes a shot goalwards and can\u2019t believe it when Nayler makes an instinctive stop with her legs! 64 min: Van der Gragt appears to have recovered. 61 min: Van der Gragt is hobbling. She needs some treatment from the physio. 60 min: Martens sends Miedema through on goal, but the striker\u2019s shot drifts inches wide of the far post. 59 min: Van Lunteren sends a dangerous cross in from the right but Stott heads away. 56 min: Miedema threatens again, almost reaching a loose ball in the New Zealand area, but Nayler manages to shovel it away. 55 min: There\u2019s a VAR check for a possible penalty. Apparently there was a handball. They\u2019re not telling us who handballed it. Anyway the drama passes quickly. No penalty. To either side. 54 min: Miedema locates Martens on the left. She shifts the ball on to her left foot, makes space for a shot and whips it over the bar. 53 min: Up the other end Miedema surges through on goal, but Nayler speeds off her line to smother the danger. Good goalkeeping. 52 min: Chance drives down the left and pings a low cross into the middle. Gregorius is this far away from turning it in. Hassett picks up possession on the right. Her cross finds Gregorius, but the striker\u2019s looping effort doesn\u2019t have enough pace on it to beat Van Veenendaal. 51 min: It\u2019s been a slow start. 48 min: Nayler has to rush to boot a backpass away. Martens was closing in. 46 min: Holland get the second half underway. All told, this is a very entertaining game of football. Definite shades of the New Zealanders\u2019 win over England, where they defended resolutely and nabbed a goal. The Kiwis are certainly doing better than their Antipodean cousins - Australia got tonked 3-0 by the Netherlands in their final pre-tournament friendly. There have been chances at both ends, but it\u2019s goalless at the break. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min+2: Bloodworth has recovered. 45 min+1: Bloodworth misses a great chance! A New Zealand corner is only half cleared and Van de Donk feeds Miedema on the edge of the area. Miedema drives down the left and lifts a cross into the middle. Nayler comes and flaps at it, with Martens closing in, and takes a whack for her troubles. The ball breaks to Bloodworth, but she scuffs a comical shot wide with the goal gaping. 45 min: Miedema\u2019s shot from 20 yards is deflected wide for a corner. 44 min: \u201cThe Oranje and the Kiwis?\u201d Peter Oh says. \u201cCan we call it the Vitamin C derby?\u201d 42 min: It\u2019s been a decent half, but both teams need a sharper edge in the final third. Holland haven\u2019t created enough for all the possession they\u2019ve enjoyed. 39 min: Spitse\u2019s dangerous inswinging corner from the left somehow evades everyone in the middle and bounces wide of the far post. It was one of those that only needed a touch. 38 min: Holland win a corner on the left. 34 min: New Zealand make a rare sortie and go close to snatching the lead, only for Van Veenendaal to push White\u2019s swerving 25-yarder away for a corner. 30 min: Martens slips a pass through to Miedema, but the striker\u2019s shot is blocked by Bott. 29 min: The corner comes in from the right. A New Zealand defender takes a tumble, sparking mayhem in the area. Bloodworth rises highest to head the ball into the middle. It flicks off a New Zealand head, leaving Nayler stranded and the goal vacant. Yet Martens can\u2019t rise high enough at the far post and heads over the bar! 28 min: Holland win a corner on the right. 26 min: The stretcher has been sent away. After a chat with the physio it seems Gregorius will continue. Panic over. 25 min: Gregorius is down injured. They\u2019re calling for a stretcher. 24 min: Holland are very dominant in possession now. But there\u2019s always a sense New Zealand could capitalise on an error or catch them on the break. 22 min: At the risk of jinxing them, these Kiwis can defend. They\u2019re also putting in a strong defensive effort so far despite missing the services of Meikayla Moore, whose World Cup was over before it began when she ruptured her Achilles tendon in training the other day. 19 min: The corner comes to nothing. 18 min: Martens inconveniences Bott again, twisting and turning, but she has to settle for a corner after running out of room. 17 min: Holland are beginning to dominate. Their football is slick and quick. A goal could be on the way. 13 min: Holland stir at the other end, attacking down the right again, but Miedema heads over from 12 yards. This has been a bright start. 11 min: New Zealand hit the bar! Holland make a right John Stones of an attempt to play out from the back and get themselves into a horrible mess. Chance nabs possession, drives to the left and pings a lovely shot towards the far corner. It beats Van Veenendaal and looks like it\u2019s heading in \u2013 only for the ball to crash back off the face of the bar. What a let-off for the Dutch. Though they still have some defending to do. New Zealand swing a cross into the area and Gregorius heads straight at Van Veenendaal. 10 min: Van de Sanden sends a cross in from the right. It bounces to Martens, who sweeps a low shot towards the bottom corner from 15 yards, but Nayler gets down to make a good save. That was a sign of the threat from Martens. 9 min: Riley sends a ball over the top, looking for Gregorius, and momentarily Holland look in trouble. Until the flag goes up for offside. 7 min: Van de Donk appears to have recovered from that blow. 5 min: This is worrying for Holland. Van de Donk is down with an injury. Her afternoon might be over. 3 min: New Zealand respond in kind, Percival charging down the right, but her cross is cleared. Peep! New Zealand, all in white, get the game underway. They\u2019re kicking from right to left. You know what Holland are wearing. And the Dutch are on the attack straight away, Martens turning away from Bott quite brilliantly on the left. The forward sends in a cross, but it\u2019s headed away. We\u2019ve had the anthems. Now a jaunty dance beat is blaring round the stadium. As sure a sign as any the game\u2019s about to begin. Here come the teams. Football soon! It is a heavily Dutch crowd here in Le Havre - with swathes of orange in the crowd and only the odd patch of white (the New Zealand football teams wear white, in contrast to their rugby colleagues). The Netherlands are definitely favourites today, so it could be a fun day in the sun for the visiting Dutch fans. \u201cLooking forward to seeing the Dutch attackers today,\u201d Rob Edwards says. \u201cMiedema and Martens is probably the best strike force in the competition.\u201d It\u2019s an exciting combination. So exciting, in fact, that I went to interview Miedema at Arsenal a couple of years ago. Enjoy! New Zealand: Nayler; Bott, Stott, Erceg, Riley; Hassett, Bowen, Percival, White, Chance; Gregorius. Netherlands: Van Veenendaal; Van Lunteren, Van der Gragt, Bloodworth, Van Es; Groenen, Van de Donk, Spitse; Van de Sanden, Miedema, Martens. Referee: Edina Alves Batista (Brazil) Hello.

It\u2019s unlikely that an experience like this will be beneficial for most cats.\u201d Cummings conceded that Kidman might well genuinely believe Ginger and Snow were happy with the experience, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a very human perspective to think they would enjoy seeing the world like this, rather than considering the situation from a feline perspective.\u201d However, he added: \u201cCats would much prefer to explore outside, in their own territory, with control over their own movements.\u201d Meanwhile Elisa Allen, director at the UK wing of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, commented that \u201calthough most cats would prefer to lounge indoors than to go hiking, all cats are different, and it\u2019s possible some may enjoy the outdoor experience.\u201d She added: \u201cPETA encourages anyone who uses specially designed cat-carrying backpacks or any other animal-carrying accessory to be responsible and ensure that animals are carried gently and with care, aren\u2019t confined for long periods of time, and are never left unattended.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, Kidman said she also owned alpacas, chickens and 10 fish, and that she has in the past eaten ants, describing the taste as \u201csort of off. Just acidic-y. Kind of weird. And I\u2019ll eat anything. I\u2019ve eaten almost anything. Witchetty grubs, worms and insects\u2026\u201d",

Kawhi Leonard went supernova, channeling the inner Michael Jordan persona that has now become ubiquitous when discussing his combination of macho-ness, machine-ness, and clutch-ness.

Raptors coach Nick Nurse called a puzzling timeout that drained all of the energy from the building. As sports consumers, we\u2019re prone to casting the result retroactively through these moments.

It sapped them of momentum, allowed their opponents to draw up their best plays, stuff like that.</p> \n<p>But this decision was objectively awful. It only gets worse the farther we step away.

      "bodyText": "It took a shooting barrage for Golden State to overcome the Raptors, 106-105, to clinch Game 5 of the NBA finals. It was the Raptors\u2019 game to lose. The Warriors came out to a smoking-hot start, then lost Kevin Durant to a soul-draining achilles injury and Kevon Looney, a key piece of the rotation, who re-aggravated a fracture in his chest. Toronto didn\u2019t claim their first lead until there were five minutes left to play. Kawhi Leonard went supernova, channeling the inner Michael Jordan persona that has now become ubiquitous when discussing his combination of macho-ness, machine-ness, and clutch-ness. Leonard went on a scoring tear. This was his for-the-ages moment. He poured in 10 straight points, decimating the Warriors lead and putting Toronto up by six with two minutes to play. The crowd was electric; Canada set to win its first major North American sports title in 26 years. And then ... nothing. Raptors coach Nick Nurse called a puzzling timeout that drained all of the energy from the building. As sports consumers, we\u2019re prone to casting the result retroactively through these moments. A timeout is good when the team goes on to win. It allowed them to gain focus and re-engage, to switch on, we say. It is bad when that team loses. It sapped them of momentum, allowed their opponents to draw up their best plays, stuff like that. But this decision was objectively awful. It only gets worse the farther we step away. The Warriors went on a 9-2 run post-timeout to clinch the win. Klay Thompson hit two clutch three-pointers and Steph Curry added one of his trademark, off-balance, bonkers threes to put the Warriors up by one and seal the victory. Curry and Thompson have now each made at least five three-pointers in the same NBA finals game four times. No other duo in NBA history has more than one such game.

Arteries harden as calcium becomes deposited in the elastic walls of the vessels, a process that happens as we age and is exacerbated for patients with diabetes or kidney disease. Stiffening can also occur as calcium becomes deposited in fatty plaques in the arteries \u2013 a condition called atherosclerosis. The mechanism that causes the calcium to be deposited has been difficult to unpick, but now scientists say they have the answer: it is triggered by a molecule, called poly(ADP-Ribose) or PAR, that is produced when the cells, or the DNA inside them, are damaged. That, they say, makes sense: ageing, high blood pressure, smoking and fatty plaques are risk factors for stiffening of the arteries, and are linked to damage to cells, or even their DNA. The team say the new discovery could prove important for patients. \u201cIf [the calcification process] is driven by cells that means you can actually treat it,\u201d said Cathy Shanahan, professor of cell signalling and co-author of the study from King\u2019s College London. Writing in the journal Cell Reports, the team describe a series of experiments involving bone-forming tissues from sheep and blood vessel cells from cows, as well as human arteries. The results reveal that where PAR is found in high levels outside cells, calcium deposits are also found. What\u2019s more, these areas were found to be rich in markers of cell death, or cells with DNA damage. They also found PAR binds to calcium, as well as to certain proteins found between cells in the walls of arteries and bone-forming tissues. As a result, the team propose that PAR, which has previously been linked to DNA repair and cell death, plays a key role not only in bone formation but in hardening of the arteries. Crucially, further experiments, including in rats, showed that if an enzyme involved in producing PAR is blocked, calcium is no longer deposited in arteries even when DNA is damaged. They also found an existing antibiotic used for acne, called minocycline, can do the job. \u201cPeople have been studying this for decades and this is the first potential therapy ever,\u201d said Prof Melinda Duer, co-author of the study from the University of Cambridge. However, the team say that while it offers hope that artery stiffening might be prevented in some at-risk groups, questions remain. Duer stressed that individuals should continue to avoid lifestyles habits that can contribute to artery stiffening, including smoking and poor diets. Shanahan agreed. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is whether it is going to work on people who have already got a lot of calcification,\u201d she said. Paul Evans, professor of cardiovascular science at the University of Sheffield, said drugs such as minocycline that switch off PAR production might one day help patients with arterial disease. \u201cThere is considerable interest in the development of PAR inhibitors for cancer and other diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that some of these medicines could benefit patients with cardiovascular disease by lessening the symptoms of angina and by reducing the likelihood of heart attack or stroke\u201d.",

But I would very strongly fight against a second referendum, which I don\u2019t think is in the interest of Scotland and it\u2019s definitely not in the interests of the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Leadsom said she believed another referendum could be avoided by working to strengthen the union. \u201cWhat I think we have to be doing is promote the strength of the UK working together far stronger, far more than we have done, and I have a number of policy areas that I would use to try and make that happen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Most Tory leadership candidates have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/10/second-brexit-referendum-would-be-doing-snps-work-boris-johnson-claims\">so far ruled out</a> any prospect of a second independence referendum.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom has said she would \u201cnever say never\u201d to the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum, saying she is a believer in devolution but opposed to a fresh vote in principle. Speaking after her campaign launch on Tuesday morning, the former leader of the House of Commons suggested it would not be right for her to issue a blanket ban on any future referendum, even though she was against it. \u201cThe reason I say \u2018never say never\u2019 is because I do not think that there should be another independence referendum in Scotland, I do not think it\u2019s in their interest, but on the other hand, I am a big believer in devolution,\u201d she said. \u201cSo what I just want to say is I am not going to stand here and utterly rule it out because I think that that is disrespectful. But I would very strongly fight against a second referendum, which I don\u2019t think is in the interest of Scotland and it\u2019s definitely not in the interests of the UK.\u201d Leadsom said she believed another referendum could be avoided by working to strengthen the union. \u201cWhat I think we have to be doing is promote the strength of the UK working together far stronger, far more than we have done, and I have a number of policy areas that I would use to try and make that happen,\u201d she said. Most Tory leadership candidates have so far ruled out any prospect of a second independence referendum. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, and the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, have all suggested they would not grant the Scottish parliament the powers to run another legally binding vote. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has published draft legislation on how a fresh referendum should be run in the second half of 2020. Javid said he would not allow a second independence referendum and Sturgeon should spend time improving public services rather than calling for a fresh vote. Hancock said his message would be \u201cNo way, Nicola\u201d to the idea of a fresh independence referendum. Hancock, who has the backing of several Scottish Conservative MPs, said: \u201cI\u2019m against second referendums because we live in a democracy and we follow the results of the first. When people are given a vote, politicians should listen. \u201cThe SNP government would do better to focus on the powers that it does have that it isn\u2019t using well enough. We all said before the Scottish referendum that this would settle the issue for a generation, and it has.\u201d Stewart said a fresh referendum on either Brexit or Scottish independence would only divide the country further, and has proposed a \u201cminister for the union\u201d in order to strengthen the UK. \u201cIn everything we do and everything we say in this leadership race, we should remember that the key is to unify the country and not divide the United Kingdom,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on the UK unemployment report: Jobs growth in the British economy has cooled after months of employers appearing to shrug off Brexit concerns. Employment in Britain increased by 32,000 to reach a record high of 32.75 million in the three months to April, according to the Office for National Statistics, fuelled by a rise in the numbers of self-employed people and women entering the workforce. The rise was the weakest since August and significantly down on the average 167,000 recorded in the first quarter, although it continued to show that the UK jobs market was defying the worst fears over Brexit. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \u201cThe rate of increase in the latest three months was slower than in most previous quarters, which may be a sign that Brexit-related uncertainty is beginning to make companies more cautious about new hiring.\u201d John Philpott of the Jobs Economist consultancy said the rise in employment masked a drop of 38,000 in the number of workers employed by a company, with self-employed people accounting for the entire net rise. \u201cA closer look at the figures offers a slightly different story,\u201d he said. Britain\u2019s economy has continued to generate new jobs, sending the employment rate to record levels. Unemployment has also fallen, dropping by 34,000 to 1.3 million in the three months to April. The jobless rate remained at its lowest level since the mid 1970s, at 3.8%. But, some economists believe that businesses have continued to hire workers to meet demand rather than invest for the long term in productivity-boosting technology amid the uncertainty over Britain leaving the EU. In a potential sign that the country\u2019s jobs boom could be running out of steam, the ONS said the number of job vacancies in Britain dropped to 837,000, falling from 861,000 at the start of the year. Here\u2019s the full story: Bad news! Carbon emissions from the global energy industry rose by the fastest rate in almost a decade last year. The increase, which risks worsening climate change, was ironically driven by more volatile weather patterns. Surprise swings in global temperatures created more days that were either unusually hot (driving demand for air conditioning) or cold (boosting heating). My colleague Jillian Ambrose has the details: Carbon emissions climbed by 2% last year, faster than any year since 2011, because the demand for energy easily oustripped the rapid rollout of renewable energy. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s energy demand increase was due to higher demand in China, India and the US which was in part due to stronger industry as well as the \u201cweather effect\u201d. This was spurred by an \u201coutsized\u201d energy appetite in the US which recorded the highest number of days with hotter or colder than average days since the 1950s. Here\u2019s the full story: Back in parliament, Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent also had his reappointment hearing today, following up on Michael Saunders\u2019 appearance in front of the Treasury select committee this morning. Broadbent, who is one of the frontrunners to succeed governor Mark Carney next year, was tight lipped about whether he had applied for the job. However, he said the Bank\u2019s next leader should follow in Carney\u2019s footsteps by continuing to modernise the 300-year-old institution (while of course fulfilling its remit for financial and price stability.) Gender and ethnic diversity also seemed to be on the agenda. The deputy was immediately peppered with questions over the suspension of Neil Woodford\u2019s investment fund, but Broadbent said he doesn\u2019t think the episode had spilled over to other funds or financial markets \u201cso far as we can tell.\u201d He said there will be episodes where investment fund suspensions \u201cis the right thing to do\u201d. He told MPS: \u201cThe real financial stability risk in some ways will come from funds having to liquidate assets very quickly at values that are well below their market price, and that\u2019s precisely what suspensions are designed to prevent. Broadbent said there may be questions over whether investors are sufficiently aware of the risks involved in investing in open-ended funds like Woodford. He also addressed the manager\u2019s listing of private holdings on the Guernsey stock exchange to get around EU rules that cap unlisted investments at 10%. \u201cThere were no rules broken as far as I understand it,\u201d Broadbent said. But the Bank\u2019s deputy governor ultimately came to the defence of City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, which he said could not be expected to safeguard customers to the point where they faced little to no risk. You cannot have a system where collectively could reduce all risk to zero. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s desirable. There is risk in these funds, there is risk in risky assets.\u201d Meanwhile in America, Donald Trump has launched a not-very-presidential attack on the US central bank. Trump has claimed that the Federal Reserve \u2018don\u2019t have a clue\u2019, and should cut interest rates to help weaken the US dollar. I think Trump is responding to new producer price inflation data (PPI), which show that the cost of US goods and services rose by 1.8% per year in May, down from April\u2019s 2.2%. However core PPI increased 2.3% in the 12 months through May after rising 2.2% in April -- partly due to a surge in the cost of hotel accommodation. Trump has also defended his trade policies, in a tweet seemingly directed towards Fox News presenters: Some 18,000 jobs are in doubt today at Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia empire. Tomorrow Arcadia will ask its landlords to vote on a rescue plan that will cut rents and allow some stores to close. The vote was dramatically stopped at the last minute a week ago, after it became clear that Green didn\u2019t have enough support. He\u2019s now offered a more generous deal -- but at least one landlord isn\u2019t impressed. INTU, which owns 35 Arcadia stores, is likely to vote against the CVA tomorrow, sources say. Green has claimed that Arcadia, which includes Top Shop and Miss Selfridge, could fall into administration if the deal isn\u2019t approved..... Public sector pay rose faster than wages at private companies last month - for the first time in around five years! Total average earnings across the public sector rose by 4.2% year-on-year in April alone, the ONS reports, outpacing the 3.7% growth in private sector pay during the month. The tight grip of austerity may finally be easing, as the government starts to relax its pay cap on public sector pay -- just as Brexit uncertainty hits companies. The ONS explains: Total pay growth tapered off because smaller bonuses were paid in that month than a year ago, and there was reduced growth in private sector total pay, especially in the wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants and the manufacturing sectors. Arno Hantzsche, senior economist at the NIESR thinktank, adds: \u201cA boost to wage growth in April came from the public sector where earnings picked up after a decade of pay restraint. It offset some of the emerging weaknesses in the private sector where pay growth is stabilising as a result of Brexit and global uncertainties.\u201d Looking back at the unemployment report, it\u2019s clear that changes to the pension age mean more women are working longer. The number of women in work jumped by 60,000 in the February-April quarter to a record high of 15.46m women. It\u2019s a different story for men, though; the number of employed men fell by 27,000 on the quarter to 17.29m. More women are in work because the female state pension age has been raised from 60 to 65, and will soon rise again to 66. This eliminates the gender pension gap, but has also sparked a legal protest from women who say they weren\u2019t given sufficient warning. Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, says these older workers are driving the so-called UK jobs \u2018miracle\u2019: \u201cThe number of workers aged 50 or older rose by a staggering 305,000 in the most recent jobs figures, representing the lion\u2019s share of the total 357,000 increase. \u201cIn fact, the number of workers under age 24 dropped by 43,000 during the year while those aged 65 or older rose by 80,000. \u201cThis will at least in part reflect state pension age increases, with women seeing their state pension age rise to 65 during 2018. Over in Parliament, MPs have been grilling Bank of England policymakers. First up was Michael Saunders who was pushed for views on the US-China trade war, his consumer spending forecasts and, of course, Brexit. The external member of the rate-setting monetary policy committee made waves even before he spoke. In written testimony to the Treasury Select Committee, Saunders warned: \u201cA no-deal Brexit would probably have a significant adverse effect on the UK\u2019s long term growth prospects, because of reduced openness to international trade in both goods and services,and the resultant deterioration in the attractiveness of the UK as a global business location.\u201d Saunders, who is being reappointed to the Bank\u2019s MPC, is at least optimistic on consumer spending, which he chalks up to jobs and pay \u201cdoing better than many people had expected.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s worth noting that his forecast of a continued rise in spending is contingent on a \u201csmooth Brexit.\u201d On the global front, Saunders says the US-China trade war has dented global growth, which in turn has impacted the UK economy. However, he said central banks including the Bank of England still have the tools to respond. \u201cIn terms of monetary policy fire power... if it was right to loosen policy, we could cut interest rates close to zero - we wouldn\u2019t go to negative rates - but we still have the option of expanding QE further. Now we\u2019ve done substantial amount, but in theory we could expand it significantly further.\u201d Economist Rupert Seggins has pulled together a neat thread on today\u2019s unemployment report: Mike Amesbury MP, Labour\u2019s shadow employment minister, is concerned that many of Britain\u2019s poorest-paid workers are still struggling to cope. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s unemployment data: \u201cBehind these statistics, the simple truth is that many people are trapped in low paid, insecure work \u2013 and they are often left struggling to meet basic household costs. \u201cIn-work poverty has increased faster than employment, and 70% of children growing up in poverty live in a family where someone is in work. That is totally unacceptable. \u201cLabour will invest in training and the economy throughout the UK, so we can create decent, skilled jobs that last and lift people out of poverty.\u201d Last week, the ONS reported that 17% of the U.K. population was in poverty in 2017, up from 15.9% in 2016, and above the EU average (this is defined a households with disposable incomes below 60% of the national median). The TUC is concerned that wages aren\u2019t rising faster -- and argue that the minimum wage should be increased further (on top of this year\u2019s rise). General secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cWage growth is still stuck in the slow lane. Real pay is still lower than it was before the 2008 crisis and this rate of growth won\u2019t restore decent living standards. \u201cWe need to speed things up. The government must raise the minimum wage to \u00a310 as quickly as possible and take action to strengthen the economy, including by embedding real pay rises across the whole of the public sector. \u201cAnd unions should have the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate fair pay rises.\u201d In April alone, UK basic pay jumped by 3.8% per year. That\u2019s a welcome boost for workers, meaning wages grew much faster than inflation (which was 2.1% in April) This is partly because the minimum wage rose at the start of April, by 4.9% to \u00a37.83 an hour for those aged 25 and over. That helped lift wages for the lowest-paying staff, helping to push total basic pay growth up to 3.4% from 3.3% (as flagged earlier). Alastair Neame, senior economist at the CEBR thinktank, says around two million people will have benefitted, or around 7% of the workforce. Although the change affects a large number of people, their pay is by definition relatively low, meaning there may be little impact on the headline measure of average weekly earnings. But for the affected households and their employers the impact is potentially significant. Employers now face the prospect of paying higher wages from their margins or cutting their headcount and critics of minimum wages worry that higher unemployment will result from an artificially high wage floor. Even though basic pay rose last month (to 3.4% per year), workers are still poor than before the 2008 financial crisis. The Resolution Foundation have crunched the numbers, and shows that average pay is still a little below its peak 11 years ago (once you adjust for the rising cost of living). Real pay may not recover all the last ground until next year. Employment Minister Alok Sharma has welcomed today\u2019s unemployment report, saying: \u201cOnce again we see more people in work than ever before; 3.7 million more since 2010. A testament to the Government\u2019s support for employers and jobseekers on a day where we also mark that 2 million claimants are now being supported through Universal Credit. \u201cWith wage growth increasing pace on last month, outstripping inflation for the 15th month in a row, and record high female employment \u2013 the Government\u2019s focus on pro-business policies and balanced economic management is delivering opportunity for all.\u201d Economists are broadly in agreement that Britain\u2019s jobs market looks solid. Here\u2019s the ONS\u2019s chief economist, Grant Fitzner: Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation thinktank points out that wages have been steadily outpacing inflation for some time now: However, Howard Archer of EY Item Club is concerned that employment growth has slowed: Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, warns that job creation may be softening: \u201cThe buoyant labour market is still going strong for the UK economy, even as it weathers widespread political uncertainty. \u201cBusinesses\u2019 avid appetite for new hires has drawn many out of unemployment and inactivity into work, which has provided uplift to household incomes. With vacancies outpacing the number of people available to fill them, competition has pushed up wages in new positions, giving a boost to job switchers and starters. \u201cHowever, the employment boom cannot last forever, and is certainly showing signs of softening. Business leaders are finding it harder to recruit as the supply of talent shrinks, and wage growth has failed to sustain the heights we saw earlier this year. To build on the existing strengths of the jobs market, the Government will need to step up on its training agenda in order to support businesses to overcome skills shortages and drive up productivity and pay packets.\u201d The number of vacancies in the UK economy has fallen - perhaps a sign that employment growth is weakening. There were 837,000 unfilled positions in the three months to May - down from 861,000 at the start of this year. Here are the key points from the UK jobs report: The UK employment rate was estimated at 76.1%, higher than a year earlier (75.6%) and the joint-highest on record. The UK unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%; it has not been lower since October to December 1974. The UK economic inactivity rate was estimated at 20.8%, lower than a year earlier (21.0%) and close to a record low. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain were estimated to have increased by 3.4%, before adjusting for inflation, and by 1.5%, after adjusting for inflation, compared with a year earlier. Including bonuses, average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain were estimated to have increased by 3.1%, before adjusting for inflation, and by 1.2%, after adjusting for inflation, compared with a year earlier. Once you adjust for inflation, real basic wage growth was actually flat in the last quarter at 1.5%. Why aren\u2019t workers getting larger pay rises, given unemployment is so low? The ONS says.... In a tightening labour market, it would be expected that labour shortages would put pressure on wages to increase. However, the uncertainty in the economy may be reducing the impact of such pressure. UK wage growth was also stronger than expected. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 3.4% per annum in the February-April quarter. That\u2019s up from 3.3% last month. However, total pay (including bonuses) only rose by 3.1%, down from 3.3% a month ago. The ONS says: In the private sector, total pay increased by 3.2% on the year to reach \u00a3531 in April. In the public sector, it grew by 3% on the year to reach \u00a3542 in April. In April 2019, total pay growth tapered off because smaller bonuses were paid in that month than a year ago, and there was reduced growth in private sector total pay, especially in the wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants and the manufacturing sectors. The data on regular pay (which excludes bonus payments) show that for the whole economy, regular pay increased by 3.4% on the year to reach \u00a3502 in April 2019. Private sector regular pay increased by 3.5% on the year to reach \u00a3493 in April, while public sector total pay increased by 2.8% on the year to reach \u00a3541 Breaking: Britain\u2019s economy has kept creating jobs, in the face of Brexit uncertainty and trade war jitters. The Office for National Statistics reports that the number of people in employment in the UK increased by 32,000 to a record high of 32.75 million, in the three months to April. That\u2019s a slowdown compared to the previous quarter, in which 99,000 new jobs were created. Unemployment kept falling too -- down 34,000 in the last quarter to 1.3 million. It means the UK unemployment remains at its lowest level in around 44 years, at 3.8%. The unemployment rate for women fell to a joint-record low of 3.7%, with the number of economically inactive women reduced to a record low of 5.2 million. More to follow.... Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management points out that @realDonaldTrump has been more vocal about the trade war with China recently. However, Donovan also suspects Trump may resist imposing new tariffs as the re-election race hots up, telling clients: US President Trump suggested the threat of trade taxes against goods that have spent any time in Mexico may be revisited in ninety days. This is unlikely to affect markets in the near term (the closer we get to the US presidential election, the less credible threats of tax hikes become). It does reinforce the idea of a risk premium for investing in supply chains involving the US. US President Trump also suggested that there would be more trade taxes if Chinese President Xi failed to meet with Trump at the G20. The Trump Twitter Feed has become more aggressive in suggesting tax increases after the end of June. Shares in Ted Baker, the UK fashion chain, have slumped by a quarter this morning after it hit investors with another profits warning. The group slashed its earnings outlook again, warning that trading conditions have deteriorated. \u201cOngoing consumer uncertainty in a number of key markets and elevated levels of promotional activity across our global markets have resulted in extremely difficult trading conditions during the financial year to date. I imagine the \u2018forced hugging\u2019 row which prompted founder Ray Kelvin to quit earlier this year won\u2019t have helped the firm either.. Investors don\u2019t seem too worried about the threat of a recession. European markets have opened higher, on the back of strong gains in Asia overnight. This has sent Britain\u2019s Footsie index to a new five-week high, clawing back May\u2019s losses. FTSE 100: up 31 points or 0.4% to 7,406 German DAX: up 123 points or 1% at 12,168 French CAC: up 17 points or 0.3% at 5,400 Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Closing their ears to more Trump trade chatter, the markets continued their June jump, if with slightly less spring in their step. China\u2019s Shanghai market also had a good day; the CSI300 index has jumped 3%, or over 108 points, to 3,719 points. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index has gained 1.6%. Why aren\u2019t investors panicking about the prospect of a deeper US-China trade war? One theory is that they suspect a deal will be struck at the G20 summit -- and that Trump\u2019s threat of fresh tariffs if Xi doesn\u2019t play ball will let him declare victory once the agreement\u2019s been signed. Donald Trump taste for trade conflict could even extend to French wine. The president has claimed that America\u2019s wine industry is being treated unfairly, because French wine incurs a low tariff when imported into the US. The Hill has the details: \u201cYou know, France charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for French wine,\u201d Trump said. The president claimed that winemakers in California complained to him that French wine can be imported at little cost, but that they have to pay high duties to export their products into France. \u201cAnd you know what, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do something about it.\u201d Wine tariffs are set across the EU, so any clampdown on claret, champagne, and c\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne would also affect gewurztraminer, riesling, rioja etc from other member states. According to America\u2019s Wine Institute, EU tariffs range from 11 cents to 29 cents per bottle, while the US charges just 5 cents for a standard 750ml bottle from Europe, or 14 cents for fizz. Trump, of course, is a teetotal, so wouldn\u2019t suffer from a wine war. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese goods is worrying US businesses. Gary Shapiro from the Consumer Technology Association fears they could drive the US economy into a \u201cTrump recession\u201d. He told CNBC that tariffs aren\u2019t working as well as the president claims: \u201cThey are taxes, they hurt consumers, they hurt American companies.\u201d Last month, America hiked the tariff on thousands of Chinese products from 10% to 25%. It\u2019s due to kick in next weekend, making food, machinery, consumer goods, and chemicals more expensive to import. That still leaves around half China\u2019s sales to the US, worth around $300bn, in the firing line for Trump tariffs. Many economists fear that the US economy has slowed in recent months, partly due to trade conflicts. Last Friday\u2019s weak jobs report, showing American firms only hired 75,000 new staff last week, has added to these worries. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump once boasted of being a \u2018Tariff Man\u2019, and sometimes it feels like the US president enjoys talking about little else. Just days after lifting the threat of a trade war with Mexico, Trump has floated the prospect of a deeper conflict with China. In a piece of tub-thumping drama, the president declared overnight that he\u2019d impose new tariffs on Chinese exports \u201cimmediately\u201d if its leader, Xi Jinping, doesn\u2019t meet him at the G20 summit later this month. He told reporters that America could impose tariffs of 25%, or even higher, on the $300bn of Chinese goods that haven\u2019t yet been caught up in the trade war. Such a move would be a major escalation in a conflict that has already dented trade and weighed on global growth. But Trump isn\u2019t backing down, telling CNBC that his trade war policy is getting results. \u201cThe China deal is going to work out. You know why? Because of tariffs. Right now, China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don\u2019t want to pay the tariffs.\u201d [Fact check: American importers, not Chinese exporters, pay these tariffs.....] Trump\u2019s comments put Beijing in rather a fix. President Xi Jinping can hardly be seen kowtowing to the White House, so may resist committing to a meeting at the G20. But without formal talks at the G20, how will the trade war be resolved? This may take some diplomatic skills. Also coming up today New UK unemployment data is due this morning, which may show that the long run of rising employment levels has faded. Economists also predict that earnings growth slowed - basic pay, excluding bonuses, may have risen by 3.1% in the year to April, down from 3.3% a month ago. This would be another sign that the British economy is stumbling in the face of economic uncertainty at home and abroad; just yesterday, we learned that the UK economy shrank by an alarming 0.4% in April. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sets the scene: Having seen manufacturing activity fall sharply in April there is a concern that wage growth could start to go the same way as the economy slows. Having come in at 3.3% for the last three months there is a sense we could start to slip back, with expectations of a softening to 3.1%, for the three months to April. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.8%. Two of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers - deputy governor Ben Broadbent and MPC member Michael Saunders - may give their view on the UK economy today. They\u2019re appearing at parliament for re-appointment hearings to the BoE. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK unemployment and earnings report 10am BST: Eurozone sentix investor confidence survey 10am BST: BoE policymakers Michael Saunders and Ben Broadbent at the Treasury Committee in parliament",

      "body": "<p>In May 1975, his marriage breaking up, Bob Dylan spent six weeks in the south of France. His host, an artist named David Oppenheim, had recently provided a painting for the back cover of Blood on the Tracks, an album of seemingly confessional songs that had taken Dylan back to the top of the charts. Critics acclaimed its songs as evidence that, after almost a decade of straying from the straight and narrow, he was prepared once again to bare his soul.</p> <p>But Dylan, as usual, was restless. A year earlier he had toured for the first time since his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/may/24/artsfeatures1\">motorcycle accident in 1966</a>, reuniting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/24/levon-helm-interview-band\">the Band</a>, his old accomplices. It had been a commercially successful but artistically sterile experience. He was looking for something new, and he found it when Oppenheim introduced him to the Camargue, a land of salt marshes, wild horses and a village called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dca7e29ed4487c1f924e6f913d6ac77568b89b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dca7e29ed4487c1f924e6f913d6ac77568b89b5c/0_0_3350_5055/663.jpg\" alt=\"Roma girls dress a statue of St Sarah at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebration \u2026 Roma girls dress a statue of St Sarah at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Brihat/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There he witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/may/25/annual-roma-pilgrimage-at-saintes-maries-de-la-mer-in-pictures\">the annual gathering of Roma</a>, arriving from across Europe for the spring festival in celebration of Saint Sarah. Later he claimed that it was after spending his 34th birthday watching them carry her effigy from the sea to the shore, and listening to them sing at night, that he had a dream in which the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95cufW4h-gA\">One More Cup of Coffee</a> came to him, fully formed.

      "bodyText": "In May 1975, his marriage breaking up, Bob Dylan spent six weeks in the south of France. His host, an artist named David Oppenheim, had recently provided a painting for the back cover of Blood on the Tracks, an album of seemingly confessional songs that had taken Dylan back to the top of the charts. Critics acclaimed its songs as evidence that, after almost a decade of straying from the straight and narrow, he was prepared once again to bare his soul. But Dylan, as usual, was restless. A year earlier he had toured for the first time since his motorcycle accident in 1966, reuniting with the Band, his old accomplices. It had been a commercially successful but artistically sterile experience. He was looking for something new, and he found it when Oppenheim introduced him to the Camargue, a land of salt marshes, wild horses and a village called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. There he witnessed the annual gathering of Roma, arriving from across Europe for the spring festival in celebration of Saint Sarah. Later he claimed that it was after spending his 34th birthday watching them carry her effigy from the sea to the shore, and listening to them sing at night, that he had a dream in which the song One More Cup of Coffee came to him, fully formed. But it was the more general sense of a travelling community with a natural way of expressing its culture that inspired the next and typically unexpected phase of his career. \u201cThere was a Rolling Thunder energy and that was his invention,\u201d Joan Baez says in Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story, the documentary by Martin Scorsese released this week on Netflix. Using verite and concert footage, some of it first seen in Dylan\u2019s long-buried feature film Renaldo and Clara, Scorsese reframes that energy while adding a layer of meta-reality that reflects Dylan\u2019s enduring fascination with masks, disguises and alternative facts. After his return from France, Dylan based himself in a Greenwich Village apartment and underwent a full reimmersion in the folk scene from which he had emerged a dozen years earlier. In the clubs and coffee houses, fellow performers clustered around him: old friends like Ramblin\u2019 Jack Elliott, Bobby Neuwirth and Roger McGuinn and new ones such as the violinist Scarlet Rivera, whom Dylan had approached when he saw her carrying her instrument case on the street. Some of them took part in the sessions for his new album, Desire, with Rivera adding a touch of Romany abandon as she wound her fiddle lines around Dylan\u2019s voice. The songs ranged from a demand for the release of Rubin \u201cThe Hurricane\u201d Carter, a boxer imprisoned on a murder charge, to a startlingly direct address to his wife, Sara. The unit stayed together, accumulating extra members, as plans were made for taking the show on the road. Dylan wanted to perform, but he needed to escape from the music industry machine. If there were precedents for the adventure, they include the transcontinental bus trips made by Ken Kesey\u2019s Merry Pranksters in the mid-60s, the Rolling Stones\u2019 Rock and Roll Circus in 1968 and Paul McCartney\u2019s decision to exorcise the ghost of Beatlemania by taking Wings out on a small-scale, low-key, unannounced tour of British colleges in 1972. Outside, the world was a turbulent and bloody mess. The Watergate scandal was still echoing as the last US forces in Vietnam were airlifted from the roof of the Saigon embassy. The Khmer Rouge had taken over in Cambodia and civil wars were raging in Lebanon and Angola. Dylan had long since withdrawn from overt political commentary, but there was a statement implicit in his decision \u2013 made as America geared itself up for its Bicentennial celebrations \u2013 to open the tour in Plymouth, Massachusetts, where the Pilgrim Fathers had arrived in 1620 and survived a hard first winter in their new settlement only through the kindness of the indigenous Wampanoag tribe. New recruits included the singer Ronee Blakley, direct from starring in Robert Altman\u2019s Nashville, the guitarist T-Bone Burnett, and the poet Allen Ginsberg.

Zak Ov\u00e9, an artist and the curator of Get Up, Stand Up Now \u2013 which opens at Somerset House in London on Wednesday \u2013 believes black British artists are finally being properly represented in UK museums and galleries. \u201cThey\u2019ve acknowledged a place for us,\u201d said Ov\u00e9, whose father, Horace Ov\u00e9, is one of Britain\u2019s most celebrated black film-makers and photographers. \u201cThat always existed in music, but now it\u2019s open for the art world. \u201cThe horizons have broadened.

But now more institutions are opening themselves up to the contemporary artists, and showing contemporary life for people in the global diaspora.\u201d Ov\u00e9 pointed to the opening last month of Tate Britain\u2019s Frank Bowling exhibition, which gives the Guyanese-born British artist his first retrospective in the UK at the age of 85, as a sign of overdue acknowledgement. Set across multiple rooms at Somerset House, Get Up, Stand Up Now explores the development of black artists, film-makers and musicians in the UK, from Windrush generation pioneers such as the photographers Vanley Burke, Armet Francis and Charlie Phillips to contemporary artists including Grace Wales Bonner, musicians such as Gaika, and the film director Jenn Nkiru. For Ov\u00e9, the exhibition is also a chance to look back at the nascent black British art scene and acknowledge the artists who helped redefine the idea of being black and British. \u201cThese artists made work which really challenged what it meant to be British, and pushed the idea that this is a multicultural society and we needed to be validated within it,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of those artists weren\u2019t queueing up for a badge or an exhibition or acknowledgement.

      "bodyText": "Victims of the former Southampton FC and Peterborough United junior football coach Bob Higgins have branded him a monster who stole their innocence and wrecked their dreams by grooming and sexually abusing them. At the start of his sentencing hearing at Winchester crown court, victim after victim testified that they had suffered decades of mental health problems because of Higgins\u2019s crimes and expressed anger, shame and guilt at what had happened to them. Some told the court they had tried to kill themselves or turned to drink and drugs to try to blot out the abuse. Many said they had struggled over the years with flashbacks, panic attacks, depression, anxiety, lack of trust, and problems with personal relationships. Higgins, 66, from Southampton, has been convicted of sexually abusing 24 schoolboy players during a 25-year period following two trials. He ran youth training programmes at Southampton and Peterborough football clubs and spent a period as the Maltese national youth coach. Over two trials a picture of Higgins emerged of a man who abused his position of power to take advantage of a string of vulnerable players. During the sentencing hearing one victim criticised the FA and Southampton FC over their handling of Higgins. Another said that during a game the former Chelsea captain Dennis Wise had taunted him as being one of \u201cBobby\u2019s boys\u201d. Some of the victims broke down in tears as they gave evidence. Some stared at Higgins as he sat showing little emotion in the dock. The end of each impact statement was greeted with warm applause from the public gallery. One of the most emotional witnesses was the mother of Billy Seymour, a former youth player at Southampton who waived his anonymity to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the case but who died in a car crash earlier this year without being able to witness Higgins being convicted. Jean Seymour read a statement from her late son addressed to Higgins. Seymour said he felt \u201csick to the stomach\u201d that he had felt love towards his former coach and had felt broken by him. \u201cI am in safe hands now, real safe hands, not those you offered me. I am a fighter, this is closure. Goodbye Bob Higgins.\u201d She told the court her son\u2019s mental health problems caused by the trauma of being abused by Higgins had led to him living a \u201cghost of a life\u201d.

In the immediate aftermath of the allegations, the charity lost thousands of donors.</p> <p>The allegations also placed the aid sector under intense scrutiny, and prompted the UK government to host a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/18/penny-mordaunt-confronted-on-stage-by-protester-over-failings-on-aid-sex-abuse\">safeguarding summit</a> to improve accountability.</p> <p>\u201cWhat went wrong in Haiti did not happen in isolation. Our inquiry demonstrates that, over a period of years, Oxfam\u2019s internal culture tolerated poor behaviour, and at times lost sight of the values it stands for,\u201d said Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, which set up an inquiry into the allegations last year.</p> <p>The commission expressed concern over Oxfam\u2019s internal investigation into the claims that staff in Haiti had paid for sex, and over its response to separate accusations relating to abuse of children in Haiti.</p> <p>Two emails, dated July and August 2011 and said to be from a 13-year-old girl about herself and a 12-year-old girl, made allegations of physical and sexual abuse involving Oxfam staff. The email stated that the two minors had been paid for sex and had been \u201c\u2026 beaten and used by two men who I know work for you \u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was suspected by Oxfam at the time \u2013 but not then proven \u2013 that the allegations were not genuine, according to the report. However, the Charity Commission said the charity \u201cshould have tried harder to identify the source of the concerns and followed up the allegations\u201d. Last year, the emails were referred to the National Crime Agency by Oxfam and the commission.</p> <p>Speaking on behalf of former Oxfam GB trustees and senior executives, Alison Talbot, partner and head of national charities at law firm Winckworth Sherwood, said the emails were investigated by Oxfam\u2019s investigations team but \u201cwere proven to originate from outside Haiti\u201d.</p> <p>The commission issued Oxfam with an official warning, which will appear on the commission\u2019s register, and issued the charity with directions to improve.</p> <p>Caroline Thomson, Oxfam GB\u2019s chair of trustees, said the commission\u2019s <br>findings into the organisation\u2019s behaviour \u201care very uncomfortable\u201d, adding: <br>\u201cWhat happened in Haiti was shameful.\u201d</p> <p>The watchdog stopped short of accusing Oxfam of a coverup over the allegations, but said the charity should have been \u201cfuller and franker\u201d in its reports to donors and regulators. Its handling of the allegations \u201cwas influenced by a desire to protect Oxfam GB\u2019s reputation, and to protect donor and stakeholder relationships\u201d, the inquiry said.</p> <p>An internal investigation into allegations that staff members paid for sex was launched by Oxfam in 2011. However, the commission expressed serious concerns about the experience of the investigators and the resources they were given.</p> <p>During the charity\u2019s internal investigation, information was leaked, compromising the safety and confidentiality of a witness, and leading to witness intimidation, the commission found.</p> <p>In its reports to the regulator, Oxfam said categorically that misconduct did not involve beneficiaries.

      "bodyText": "There were \u201cserious problems with the culture, morale and behaviour\u201d of Oxfam staff in Haiti according to a damning report which has found that the charity failed to disclose allegations of child abuse. The Charity Commission report surveyed 7,000 pieces of evidence related to allegations that Oxfam had covered up its investigation into staff paying for sex while working on the response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. It is the most detailed report produced by the commission. The Haiti scandal prompted resignations from Oxfam GB\u2019s chief executive, Mark Goldring, and its deputy chief executive, Penny Lawrence, and caused the charity to lose UK aid. In the immediate aftermath of the allegations, the charity lost thousands of donors. The allegations also placed the aid sector under intense scrutiny, and prompted the UK government to host a safeguarding summit to improve accountability. \u201cWhat went wrong in Haiti did not happen in isolation. Our inquiry demonstrates that, over a period of years, Oxfam\u2019s internal culture tolerated poor behaviour, and at times lost sight of the values it stands for,\u201d said Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, which set up an inquiry into the allegations last year. The commission expressed concern over Oxfam\u2019s internal investigation into the claims that staff in Haiti had paid for sex, and over its response to separate accusations relating to abuse of children in Haiti. Two emails, dated July and August 2011 and said to be from a 13-year-old girl about herself and a 12-year-old girl, made allegations of physical and sexual abuse involving Oxfam staff. The email stated that the two minors had been paid for sex and had been \u201c\u2026 beaten and used by two men who I know work for you \u2026\u201d It was suspected by Oxfam at the time \u2013 but not then proven \u2013 that the allegations were not genuine, according to the report. However, the Charity Commission said the charity \u201cshould have tried harder to identify the source of the concerns and followed up the allegations\u201d. Last year, the emails were referred to the National Crime Agency by Oxfam and the commission. Speaking on behalf of former Oxfam GB trustees and senior executives, Alison Talbot, partner and head of national charities at law firm Winckworth Sherwood, said the emails were investigated by Oxfam\u2019s investigations team but \u201cwere proven to originate from outside Haiti\u201d. The commission issued Oxfam with an official warning, which will appear on the commission\u2019s register, and issued the charity with directions to improve. Caroline Thomson, Oxfam GB\u2019s chair of trustees, said the commission\u2019s findings into the organisation\u2019s behaviour \u201care very uncomfortable\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat happened in Haiti was shameful.\u201d The watchdog stopped short of accusing Oxfam of a coverup over the allegations, but said the charity should have been \u201cfuller and franker\u201d in its reports to donors and regulators. Its handling of the allegations \u201cwas influenced by a desire to protect Oxfam GB\u2019s reputation, and to protect donor and stakeholder relationships\u201d, the inquiry said. An internal investigation into allegations that staff members paid for sex was launched by Oxfam in 2011. However, the commission expressed serious concerns about the experience of the investigators and the resources they were given. During the charity\u2019s internal investigation, information was leaked, compromising the safety and confidentiality of a witness, and leading to witness intimidation, the commission found. In its reports to the regulator, Oxfam said categorically that misconduct did not involve beneficiaries. However, the commission concluded otherwise. It added that the charity should have done more to investigate whether children were among those involved. Oxfam\u2019s investigation concluded that four members of staff either did pay for sex or were suspected of doing so, including on charity premises. Three men, including the country director, Roland van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to resign, while four were sacked for gross misconduct. The watchdog said it had found evidence to indicate that Oxfam \u201cencouraged and facilitated\u201d Van Hauwermeiren\u2019s resignation, warning that this suggested \u201cmore senior staff would be treated more leniently\u201d. The inquiry also examined Oxfam\u2019s wider approach to safeguarding and concluded that the charity\u2019s own commitments and promises in the past had not always been matched by its resources. The commission instructed Oxfam trustees to submit an action plan to the regulator on how it would address concerns about its previous conduct, in an effort to \u201crepair public trust and confidence\u201d in the charity. Stephenson added that \u201ccultural and systemic change is required\u201d to address the failings identified in the report. In a statement, the charity said it has tripled its investment in safeguarding, created a new director of safeguarding post and accepted 79 detailed recommendations made by an independent review. \u201cOur first concern is for the security and safety of those we serve,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cWe acknowledge and admire the courage of survivors, and ask anyone who has experienced or witnessed abuse to come forward. Where there is evidence of wrongdoing, we will take the firmest of action, including by reporting allegations to the relevant authorities where that is appropriate.\u201d Talbot said: \u201cAs trustees and senior executives, those of us then in office were appalled when in 2011 we found out about the behaviour of some of Oxfam\u2019s staff posted to Haiti.

It doesn\u2019t matter that the evidence against Golunov was demonstrably false; it\u2019s a political case where the judge is not the one who makes the decision. Any independent judge would have thrown the case out, but in Russia, your chances of getting out \u2013 even when fully, obviously innocent \u2013 are extremely slim: for the country\u2019s top investigator the 0.51% acquittal rate is a matter of pride. But then another remarkable thing happened: there was a national outpouring of solidarity with Golunov that quickly became impossible to ignore. Since Saturday, people have been standing in line for hours for a chance to mount a \u201csingle picket\u201d \u2013 the only type of protest still allowed in Russia without permission. Celebrities recorded videos in his support and petitions were signed \u2013 over 7,500 signatures from fellow journalists, including those on state-owned outlets, and a Change.org petition is nearing 200,000 signatures. It\u2019s probably a combination of factors: Golunov\u2019s spotless personal and professional credentials; his undeniable service to the community; and the fact his arrest was an unmitigated PR disaster for Russia as it was unfolding at the time of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, where Putin appeared, hoping to attract global investors. I\u2019m sure Putin would have stopped it if he could, but you can\u2019t arbitrarily free one victim of this system without admitting that many top-ranking officials were involved in a plan to frame an innocent man for his pursuit of truth. It\u2019s a cruelly efficient system of intimidation and persecution, and Golunov\u2019s case is far from the first. But we hope this turns out to be one that finally exposes the truth. \u2022 Alexey Kovalev is investigations editor of Russian news outlet Meduza \u2022 A few minutes after this article went online, Ivan Golunov was released from house arrest, all charges against him dropped. Russia\u2019s interior minister, Vladimir Kolokoltsev, has announced that officials involved in his arrest will be investigated",

      "bodyText": "Carbon emissions from the global energy industry last year rose at the fastest rate in almost a decade after extreme weather and surprise swings in global temperatures stoked extra demand for fossil fuels. BP\u2019s annual global energy report, an influential review of the market, revealed for the first time that temperature fluctuations are increasing the world\u2019s use of fossil fuels, in spite of efforts to tackle the climate crisis. The recorded temperature swings \u2013 days which are much hotter or colder than normal \u2013 helped drive the world\u2019s biggest jump in gas consumption for more than 30 years. They also resulted in a second consecutive annual increase for coal use, reversing three years of decline earlier this decade. Carbon emissions climbed by 2% in 2018, faster than any year since 2011, because the demand for energy easily outstripped the rapid rollout of renewable energy. That level of growth in emissions represents the carbon equivalent of driving an extra 400m combustion engine cars onto the world\u2019s roads, said Spencer Dale, BP\u2019s chief economist. Dale said the increase in the number of extreme weather events and increasing demand for energy could be a vicious cycle. \u201cIf there is a link between the growing levels of carbon in the atmosphere and the types of weather patterns observed in 2018 this would raise the possibility of a worrying vicious cycle: increasing levels of carbon leading to more extreme weather patterns, which in turn trigger stronger growth in energy (and carbon emissions) as households and businesses seek to offset their effects\u201d Dale added that the report reveals \u201ca growing mismatch\u201d between society\u2019s rising demand for climate action and the actual pace of progress. Public concern over the global climate breakdown has grown significantly in recent months, driven by factors ranging from the protests led by the teenage activist Greta Thunberg to the Extinction Rebellion action, which brought parts of central London to a standstill. Last week data from the polling company YouGov found that Britons cite the environment as their third highest concern after Brexit and health, and ahead of the economy, crime and immigration. \u201cAt a time when society is increasingly concerned about climate change and the need for action, energy demand and emissions are growing at their fastest rate for years,\u201d Dale said. Two-thirds of the world\u2019s energy demand increase was due to higher demand in China, India and the US which was in part due to industrial demand, as well as the \u201cweather effect\u201d. This was spurred by an \u201coutsized\u201d energy appetite in the US which recorded the highest number of days with hotter or colder than average days since the 1950s. \u201cOn hot days people turn to their air conditioning and fans, on cold days they turn to their heaters. That has a big impact,\u201d Dale said. The unusually high number of \u201cheating days\u201d has continued in the first months of this year. The combined number of particularly hot and cold days was unusually high in the US, China and Russia where the use of fossil fuels remains high. The US shale heartlands helped to meet its rising energy demand with the biggest ever annual increase in oil and gas production for any country. Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe longer carbon emissions continue to rise, the harder and more costly will be the necessary eventual adjustment to net-zero carbon emissions.\u201d \u201cAs I have said before, this is not a race to renewables, but a race to reduce carbon emissions across many fronts,\u201d he added. The report acknowledges that emissions might have been higher without the \u201cextraordinary growth\u201d of renewables, which climbed by 14.5% last year, but warns against relying on green power and electric vehicles. The number of electric vehicles rose by just 2m, to a total of 5m. Dale added that the growth in renewables would need to have climbed by more than twice the rate achieved over the past three years to offset the impact of burning coal for electricity. \u201cAlternatively, the same outcome for carbon emissions could have been achieved by replacing around 10% of coal in the power sector with natural gas,\u201d he said. BP owns vast reserves of gas fields and consistently leads calls for countries to switch from coal to gas. It has also backed industry calls for governments to fund carbon capture technology which can scrub the emissions from the flues of power plants and factories before they reach the air. However, BP will not undertake \u201cmaterial\u201d projects without government funding. \u201cYou can\u2019t rely on the generosity of the private sector,\u201d Dale said. The BP report comes amid growing calls for arts institutions to sever their ties with fossil fuel companies. Several leading figures in the art world have called on the National Portrait Gallery to end their sponsorship deals with BP on the eve of their annual awards event this week. At the same time, activists at Extinction Rebellion urged the gallery, and the Royal Opera House, to end their \u201ccomplicity in climate breakdown\u201d. Alongside BP\u2019s climate warning, the company has confirmed that Transocean, one of its North Sea contractors, has issued a legal injunction against the Greenpeace activists occupying a BP oil rig in the Cromarty Firth, in Scotland. Greenpeace has vowed to continue with the occupation, despite the legal action, to protest against BP\u2019s plan to drill new oil wells which could hold up to 30m barrels of oil.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of protesters are to march in Moscow in support of Ivan Golunov, an investigative journalist arrested on controversial drug-dealing charges that are widely seen as an attempt to silence his reports on corruption. More than 20,000 people have so far expressed an interest on Facebook in attending the march on Wednesday, which has not been sanctioned by the authorities. The protest will pass by the headquarters of the FSB state security service, before ending outside the interior ministry, which oversees the work of the police. Protests were also expected to take place in a number of other towns and cities across Russia, as calls grew for the charges against Golunov to be dropped. Unauthorised protest rallies are often broken up by the police in Russia. Golunov, who faces up to 20 years behind bars if found guilty, said officers planted drugs on him. He is currently under house arrest. Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of the upper house, on Tuesday became the most influential figure so far to defend the journalist. \u201cThis a very bad story,\u201d said Matviyenko, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin. \u201cThere are many questions that the public must receive clear and intelligible answers to. This is either unprofessionalism, recklessness or a provocation.\u201d Matviyenko, who is nominally the third most powerful politician in Russia, said the case had been taken under the personal control of Yury Chaika, the prosecutor general. The Kremlin admitted on Monday that mistakes may have been made in the handling of the case. Golunov, who works for the Latvia-based Meduza news website, was beaten by police and kept in custody for 12 hours, said his lawyer, Sergei Badamshin, after being detained in central Moscow on 6 June.

Fulford said MI5\u2019s description of the problem as \u201ccompliance difficulties\u201d was a \u201cmisleading euphemism\u201d.</p> <p>In the absence of improvements, he said, future applications by MI5 for interception warrants \u201cwill not be approved by the judicial commissioners\u201d.</p> <p>A response sent by MI5 to Fulford earlier this year explained: \u201cIn 2016, as part of a wider review of legal compliance in anticipation of new legislation, the \u2026 problem led the team conducting the compliance review to identify, at a high level, that data might be being held in ungoverned spaces in contravention of our policies.\u201d</p> <p>Megan Goulding, a lawyer with Liberty, said: \u201cThese shocking revelations expose how MI5 has been illegally mishandling our data for years, storing it when they have no legal basis to do so. This could include our most deeply sensitive information \u2013 our calls and messages, our location data, our web browsing history.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to showing a flagrant disregard for our rights, MI5 has attempted to hide its mistakes by providing misinformation to the investigatory powers commissioner, who oversees the government\u2019s surveillance regime.\u201d</p> <p>The Green party peer, Jenny Jones, said: \u201cThis report [on MI5] has confirmed what we\u2019ve known for some time, that the security services, as well as the police, are operating their surveillance systems without accepting that they have to operate lawfully, and in a properly targeted manner.</p> <p>\u201cI know from my own experience of being put on the domestic extremism database that valuable security time and energy are wasted on the wrong targets.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the case \u201chighlights the failure of government legislation, which only facilitates more and more public bodies having access to and gathering information. Without proper scrutiny and oversight, the unauthorised handling and retention of data puts all our information at risk.\u201d </p> <p>Some of the material is thought to include exchanges between lawyers and clients that should have been protected by legal privilege. The National Union of Journalists has joined the legal challenge, which is due to be heard in full at the high court next week.</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",

The security agency has been accused of \u201cextraordinary and persistent illegality\u201d in a legal challenge brought by the human rights organisation Liberty. The failures have been identified by the official watchdog, the investigatory powers commissioner, Lord Justice Fulford, and admitted in outline by the home secretary, Sajid Javid. The full extent of the problems within MI5 became apparent in disclosures made public at the hearing on Tuesday. The revelations relate to bulk interceptions of data acquired through surveillance and hacking programmes and downloaded to its computers. The agency has a duty to ensure such material is not held longer than required or copied more often than needed. Ben Jaffey QC, for Liberty, said there were \u201cungoverned spaces\u201d in MI5\u2019s operations where it did not know what it held. In written submissions, Jaffey said: \u201cFulford\u2019s generic warrant decision notes that warrants were issued to MI5 on a basis that MI5 knew to be incorrect and the judicial commissioners [the watchdogs] were given false information.\u201d An MI5 letter sent to Fulford and released to the court showed the agency did not know what material it held. The letter said: \u201cWe are about to commence further scanning of [its computers] to ensure we have a full understanding of the data. \u201cThe full scan had been challenging to action \u2026 We have also been seeking to understand working practices \u2026 so that we can take comprehensive action to improve assurance of our compliance with relevant safeguards.\u201d Julian Milford, counsel for the Home Office and Foreign Office, told the court: \u201cWe accept that this is material that discloses compliance risks with MI5.\u201d Correspondence between Fulford and MI5 released at the hearing showed he concluded the way the agency was holding and handling people\u2019s data was \u201cundoubtedly unlawful\u201d. He said: \u201cWithout seeking to be emotive, I consider that MI5\u2019s use of warranted data \u2026 is currently, in effect, in \u2018special measures\u2019 and the historical lack of compliance \u2026 is of such gravity that [the watchdog Investigatory Powers Commissioner\u2019s Office] IPCO will need to be satisfied to a greater degree than usual that it is \u2018fit for purpose\u2019.\u201d Awareness of the problem within MI5 dated back to January 2016 but ministers were not informed until earlier this year. Fulford said MI5\u2019s description of the problem as \u201ccompliance difficulties\u201d was a \u201cmisleading euphemism\u201d. In the absence of improvements, he said, future applications by MI5 for interception warrants \u201cwill not be approved by the judicial commissioners\u201d. A response sent by MI5 to Fulford earlier this year explained: \u201cIn 2016, as part of a wider review of legal compliance in anticipation of new legislation, the \u2026 problem led the team conducting the compliance review to identify, at a high level, that data might be being held in ungoverned spaces in contravention of our policies.\u201d Megan Goulding, a lawyer with Liberty, said: \u201cThese shocking revelations expose how MI5 has been illegally mishandling our data for years, storing it when they have no legal basis to do so. This could include our most deeply sensitive information \u2013 our calls and messages, our location data, our web browsing history. \u201cIn addition to showing a flagrant disregard for our rights, MI5 has attempted to hide its mistakes by providing misinformation to the investigatory powers commissioner, who oversees the government\u2019s surveillance regime.\u201d The Green party peer, Jenny Jones, said: \u201cThis report [on MI5] has confirmed what we\u2019ve known for some time, that the security services, as well as the police, are operating their surveillance systems without accepting that they have to operate lawfully, and in a properly targeted manner. \u201cI know from my own experience of being put on the domestic extremism database that valuable security time and energy are wasted on the wrong targets.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the case \u201chighlights the failure of government legislation, which only facilitates more and more public bodies having access to and gathering information. Without proper scrutiny and oversight, the unauthorised handling and retention of data puts all our information at risk.\u201d Some of the material is thought to include exchanges between lawyers and clients that should have been protected by legal privilege. The National Union of Journalists has joined the legal challenge, which is due to be heard in full at the high court next week. The hearing continues.",

While the older generation has little to lose from patience and timidity, a new wave of activists has already lost, born into a world damaged beyond repair through no fault of their own. With no rose-tinted memories of the so-called good old days, they have little to gain from sitting patiently and waiting while white men 50 years older than them debate a future they won\u2019t be part of.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The older political establishment is actively standing in the way of progress on issues that require radical solutions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s easy for the establishment to patronise young activists because the former exist within a political structure that has been built explicitly to accommodate their type of politics: a slow, bureaucratic, opaque process overseen by people who have far more invested in their own reputations and interests than in those they represent. It might have ticked along nicely for a while \u2013 at least for those privileged enough to feel its benefits \u2013 but, ultimately, it has failed.</p> <p>And so perhaps Browne\u2019s response points to something else about this generational divide that is somewhat more uncomfortable to acknowledge. It\u2019s one thing to accept that our politicians and experts simply have a different theory of change, frustrating as it might be. But the fact is that it was their commitment to the establishment wisdom of steady, gradual change that led us here in the first place. To accept that anything else is required is also to accept responsibility and, ultimately, failure. In our feral and uncompromising political system, will anyone be brave enough?</p> <p>What the political establishment crucially fails to acknowledge is that a new generation of activists has grown up watching things go wrong on a dramatic scale in the blink of an eye. For millennials and generation Z, political life has been defined by the collapse of institution after institution. In 2008, a generation of students went to sleep one night and woke up to an unforgiving job market that may never recover fully from the financial crash. In 2016, they watched along with their younger peers as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/28/hate-crime-horrible-spike-brexit-vote-metropolitan-police\">hate-crime statistics soared</a> following the UK\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">leave the European Union</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/10/extinction-rebellion-bubble-denial-climate-crisis\">Extinction Rebellion\u2019s tactics are working.

How can anyone expect them to believe that change should be slow and steady when disaster has been so swift and ruthless?</p> <p>Ultimately, it\u2019s not just that the older political establishment has a different approach or an inherited wisdom, but that it is actively standing in the way of progress on issues that require radical and urgent solutions. In a system built explicitly to advance the slow and gradual politics that have benefited its representatives for decades, this is no small ask. But the ways of the past have failed us. While today\u2019s youth have little to lose and everything to gain from a radical new approach, the power and successes of today\u2019s establishment hang in the balance.</p> <p>To sacrifice progress and change for pride and self-interest would certainly be business as usual. But it was business as usual that got us into this position. It will have to be urgency that saves us.</p> <p>\u2022 Eve Livingston is a journalist specialising in politics, social affairs and inequalities</p>",

This generational divide between an establishment desperate to cling on to the idea of slow, gradual change and a youth fired up and impatient for radical overhaul was highlighted again last week when ex-BP boss John Browne was asked in the Observer what he would say to climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. \u201cI would say that I have been at this for longer than you\u2019ve been on the planet and that [decarbonisation] will take time,\u201d he responded. \u201cRemember that energy is a very big system and there is not one solution.\u201d Aside from his patronising tone and the fact that Thunberg\u2019s activism is in part only necessary because of his lifetime commitment to burning the fossil fuels that caused the climate crisis, Browne\u2019s response is undoubtedly frustrating for youth activists in other ways. While the older generation has little to lose from patience and timidity, a new wave of activists has already lost, born into a world damaged beyond repair through no fault of their own. With no rose-tinted memories of the so-called good old days, they have little to gain from sitting patiently and waiting while white men 50 years older than them debate a future they won\u2019t be part of. It\u2019s easy for the establishment to patronise young activists because the former exist within a political structure that has been built explicitly to accommodate their type of politics: a slow, bureaucratic, opaque process overseen by people who have far more invested in their own reputations and interests than in those they represent. It might have ticked along nicely for a while \u2013 at least for those privileged enough to feel its benefits \u2013 but, ultimately, it has failed. And so perhaps Browne\u2019s response points to something else about this generational divide that is somewhat more uncomfortable to acknowledge. It\u2019s one thing to accept that our politicians and experts simply have a different theory of change, frustrating as it might be. But the fact is that it was their commitment to the establishment wisdom of steady, gradual change that led us here in the first place. To accept that anything else is required is also to accept responsibility and, ultimately, failure. In our feral and uncompromising political system, will anyone be brave enough? What the political establishment crucially fails to acknowledge is that a new generation of activists has grown up watching things go wrong on a dramatic scale in the blink of an eye. For millennials and generation Z, political life has been defined by the collapse of institution after institution. In 2008, a generation of students went to sleep one night and woke up to an unforgiving job market that may never recover fully from the financial crash. In 2016, they watched along with their younger peers as hate-crime statistics soared following the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. In their relatively short lives they\u2019ve seen fascists win elections, terrorist attacks devastate countries across the world, climate change-accelerated natural disasters claim the lives of thousands. How can anyone expect them to believe that change should be slow and steady when disaster has been so swift and ruthless? Ultimately, it\u2019s not just that the older political establishment has a different approach or an inherited wisdom, but that it is actively standing in the way of progress on issues that require radical and urgent solutions. In a system built explicitly to advance the slow and gradual politics that have benefited its representatives for decades, this is no small ask. But the ways of the past have failed us. While today\u2019s youth have little to lose and everything to gain from a radical new approach, the power and successes of today\u2019s establishment hang in the balance. To sacrifice progress and change for pride and self-interest would certainly be business as usual. But it was business as usual that got us into this position. It will have to be urgency that saves us. \u2022 Eve Livingston is a journalist specialising in politics, social affairs and inequalities",

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A spokesman for Woodford Investment Management, which once held more than \u00a310bn but is now worth less than \u00a34bn after large investment losses and outflows of cash, said: \u201cThe company will continue to charge the fee as the fund remains actively managed and we focus on repositioning the portfolio.\u201d</p> \n<p>James Anderson, the manager of Scottish Mortgage, a FTSE 100 investment trust, said it was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d that Woodford was not waiving fees while dealings were suspended. He said fees are \u201cone of the ethical issues that are under your control\u201d.</p> \n<p>Woodford apologised to investors for a second time on Tuesday, telling them <a href=\"http://go.pardot.com/webmail/42952/847813961/cdc24cce723b846d5a0c14d2ca6999018d9cb0d717ab20d41d72f60edc04ffef\">in a letter sent via brokers</a>, that he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the \u201canxiety that the suspension has caused you\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI realise this will be concerning and frustrating to you and I am sorry for putting you in this situation,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>But Woodford defended his investment strategy, and said: \u201cIn my view, every position within the portfolio will continue to be united by one thing: under-valuation. Every asset in the portfolio has a fundamental value that significantly exceeds its share price. In some cases, in my judgement, the gap between value and price is as wide as I have ever seen in more than 30 years of public equity market investing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, which sold and promoted Woodford products, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/05/neil-woodford-apologises-to-investors-for-suspending-fund\">dropped its platform fees</a> for clients affected by the suspension. Hargreaves said it was not fair to charge customers while they were barred from trading.</p> \n<p>Hargreaves is itself facing intense scrutiny from the FCA and MPs over its role in promoting Woodford\u2019s fund in its influential \u201cWealth 50\u201d ranking of favourite funds.</p> \n<p>Bailey said the FCA would \u201clook again\u201d at fund supermarkets including Hargreaves to ensure they were impartial. The FCA investigated best-buy lists in March but did not introduce new rules.</p> \n<p>Morgan has demanded that Bailey publish details of his contact with Woodford and that he confirm whether the City watchdog was planning a formal investigation into the events that led to the fund\u2019s suspension. She said the debacle raised concerns that the FCA may have been asleep at the wheel as the fund manager tumbled into crisis. Bailey will face Morgan\u2019s Treasury select committee for a public grilling on 25 June.</p> \n<p>Morgan demanded on Tuesday that Hargreaves explain its inclusion of Woodford\u2019s fund in its Wealth 50 list. Hargreaves only removed Woodford Equity Income from the influential list when it froze withdrawals last week. She also asked the Hargreaves boss, Chris Hill, how much money the firm had made in fees from customers who had invested in Woodford\u2019s fund. At the end of March, Hargreaves\u2019s customers accounted for about \u00a32bn of \u00a310.6bn under Woodford\u2019s management.</p> \n<p>Hill said: \u201cWe have received the letter of the chair of the Treasury select committee and will reply in due course.\u201d</p> \n<p>The FCA also hit out at Woodford\u2019s skirting City rules on holdings in privates companies by listing them on the Guernsey stock exchange. Doing this allowed him to stay with EU rules that limit the proportion of unlisted or illiquid investments to no more than 10% of assets.</p> \n<p>Bailey said that while the move was \u201callowable\u201d and \u201cwithin the rules\u201d he disapproved of Woodford\u2019s tactics. \u201cI\u2019ve said publicly I don\u2019t think it is right. I think investors should be able to determine where their assets are held,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But the Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent came to the defence of the FCA during a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday, saying regulators shouldn\u2019t be expected to safeguard investors to the point where they faced no risks.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou cannot have a system which collectively could reduce all risk to zero.

      "bodyText": "Neil Woodford has refused to waive his \u00a3100,000-a-day investment management fee for his flagship fund despite demands from MPs and the UK financial regulator to scrap the charges after he prevented investors from withdrawing \u00a33.7bn of their money. Woodford, who last year paid himself and his business partner \u00a336.5m, said he would continue to collect the fees despite the intervention of Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the Treasury select committee. Bailey said Woodford, who was once the City\u2019s best-known stock-picker, \u201cshould should consider very seriously \u2026 his position\u201d. Morgan said: \u201cOthers have suspended taking fees and I think Woodford should too, for the sake that I think that it\u2019s something like \u00a3100,000 a day, potentially, in fees. \u201cI mean, that is a huge amount of money and, as I say, there are investors who have put often, sometimes, their life savings or certainly money needed for important investments [in the fund]. And they\u2019re watching that value drop.\u201d A spokesman for Woodford Investment Management, which once held more than \u00a310bn but is now worth less than \u00a34bn after large investment losses and outflows of cash, said: \u201cThe company will continue to charge the fee as the fund remains actively managed and we focus on repositioning the portfolio.\u201d James Anderson, the manager of Scottish Mortgage, a FTSE 100 investment trust, said it was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d that Woodford was not waiving fees while dealings were suspended. He said fees are \u201cone of the ethical issues that are under your control\u201d. Woodford apologised to investors for a second time on Tuesday, telling them in a letter sent via brokers, that he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the \u201canxiety that the suspension has caused you\u201d. \u201cI realise this will be concerning and frustrating to you and I am sorry for putting you in this situation,\u201d he added. But Woodford defended his investment strategy, and said: \u201cIn my view, every position within the portfolio will continue to be united by one thing: under-valuation. Every asset in the portfolio has a fundamental value that significantly exceeds its share price. In some cases, in my judgement, the gap between value and price is as wide as I have ever seen in more than 30 years of public equity market investing.\u201d The fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, which sold and promoted Woodford products, has dropped its platform fees for clients affected by the suspension. Hargreaves said it was not fair to charge customers while they were barred from trading. Hargreaves is itself facing intense scrutiny from the FCA and MPs over its role in promoting Woodford\u2019s fund in its influential \u201cWealth 50\u201d ranking of favourite funds. Bailey said the FCA would \u201clook again\u201d at fund supermarkets including Hargreaves to ensure they were impartial. The FCA investigated best-buy lists in March but did not introduce new rules. Morgan has demanded that Bailey publish details of his contact with Woodford and that he confirm whether the City watchdog was planning a formal investigation into the events that led to the fund\u2019s suspension. She said the debacle raised concerns that the FCA may have been asleep at the wheel as the fund manager tumbled into crisis. Bailey will face Morgan\u2019s Treasury select committee for a public grilling on 25 June. Morgan demanded on Tuesday that Hargreaves explain its inclusion of Woodford\u2019s fund in its Wealth 50 list. Hargreaves only removed Woodford Equity Income from the influential list when it froze withdrawals last week. She also asked the Hargreaves boss, Chris Hill, how much money the firm had made in fees from customers who had invested in Woodford\u2019s fund. At the end of March, Hargreaves\u2019s customers accounted for about \u00a32bn of \u00a310.6bn under Woodford\u2019s management. Hill said: \u201cWe have received the letter of the chair of the Treasury select committee and will reply in due course.\u201d The FCA also hit out at Woodford\u2019s skirting City rules on holdings in privates companies by listing them on the Guernsey stock exchange. Doing this allowed him to stay with EU rules that limit the proportion of unlisted or illiquid investments to no more than 10% of assets. Bailey said that while the move was \u201callowable\u201d and \u201cwithin the rules\u201d he disapproved of Woodford\u2019s tactics. \u201cI\u2019ve said publicly I don\u2019t think it is right. I think investors should be able to determine where their assets are held,\u201d he said. But the Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent came to the defence of the FCA during a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday, saying regulators shouldn\u2019t be expected to safeguard investors to the point where they faced no risks. \u201cYou cannot have a system which collectively could reduce all risk to zero. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s desirable. There is risk in these funds, there is risk in risky assets.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Heavy rain has caused widespread disruption in England, including flooded roads, railways and a hospital, and forecasters have warned of more to come. The Environment Agency issued dozens of flood alerts across England and a flood warning, which is more serious, for Wokingham, Berkshire. One of the worst-hit areas was Lincolnshire, where floodwater had to be pumped out of Pilgrim hospital in Boston. There were so many emergency in calls in the county that fire crews said they could only deal with flooding incidents if water had entered people\u2019s homes. In the south-east, railway lines near Orpington in Kent and Mitcham Junction in London were flooded as the network struggled to cope with a month\u2019s worth of rain in 24 hours. Rain also damaged power supply to trains and signalling equipment, Network Rail said. The rail operator Southern warned passengers to expect delays and cancellations for the rest of the day across the Southern and Thameslink network and urged people avoid travelling in the south London area if possible. Flash floods forced the closure of dozens of roads, including in Wymondham in Norfolk and Bromsgrove in Worcestershire. Overnight the M25 was closed for several hours in both directions after a sinkhole opened up on the carriageway near Sevenoaks in Kent. After emergency repairs the road was fully reopened in time for the morning rush-hour. In West Kingsdown, near Sevenoaks, a woman in her 80s and her dog were rescued after her home was flooded to waist height. The Met Office has extended a yellow \u201cbe prepared\u201d warning for heavy rain from Tuesday to Thursday. It now stretches from parts of north Wales in the west to the Wash in the east and all the way to Edinburgh in the north. Another warning covers Devon and Somerset, where similar conditions were expected. Forecasters predict that some areas of the UK could be inundated with up to 100mm of rain this week, twice the monthly average for June. On Wednesday and Thursday, some parts of the UK could get between 60mm and 100mm of rain, the Met Office said.

I grew up with him moulding and working with lead.\u201d He then asked: \u201cHow do we expand on the relationship to object and how object permeates and influences how we operate in social space?\u201d His thoughts on bringing A-Cold-Wall fans into the show were less academic. As a black, working-class designer, Ross is still unusual in fashion. He wants to open doors to others. \u201cThe main reason I wanted to invite the public in was so there wasn\u2019t this conservative division which is often in fashion,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel very liberal to me.\u201d Ross first studied graphic design and product design before setting up his brand. \u201cI entered fashion from a slightly different angle and I want to make sure that my position is used to incubate that [for others].\u201d He is taking this inclusivity seriously, donating his bursary from the Newgen initiative to a younger designer, 20-year-old Eastwood Danso, who showed at London Fashion Week Mens on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m speaking boldly here but I wish this to be a trend,\u201d said Ross. \u201cWe should feed back in to the industry.\u201d",

Others feel exactly the same about the prospect of asking Jewish constituents to vote Labour when the party couldn\u2019t even bring itself to suspend and formally investigate Forbes, who not only liked an antisemitic post on Facebook \u2013 an honest mistake, she says \u2013 but also commented under a rambling post about how the CIA and Mossad supposedly created Islamic State. She wrote: \u201cI have enjoyed reading this thread so much.\u201d They are right to argue that voters deserve better than being asked to condone one form of racism in hopes of avoiding another, or pushed into choosing the least worst of Brexit evils. And with a new Tory leader hovering in the wings, time is running out for Labour to clean up its act. If not now, then when? \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

It is a great shame.\u201d Announcing the decision of an independent panel at the end of last year, the Parole Board said: \u201cWe can confirm that a panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of David McGreavy following an oral hearing. \u201cParole Board decisions are solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release. \u201cThe panel will have carefully looked at a whole range of evidence, including details of the original evidence and any evidence of behaviour change. We do that with great care and public safety is our number one priority.\u201d Parole Board release decisions are sent to the Ministry of Justice, which arranges the release of prisoners.",

      "bodyText": "Protected by cylindrical walls of reinforced concrete, the steel and glass \u201cdepthscrapers\u201d extend hundreds of metres underground. Only a single floor of each inverted 35-storey skyscraper is visible at ground level. Giant mirrors mounted directly above the central wells reflect sunlight to the apartments below. Prismatic glass ensures even light throughout the day, while fresh, conditioned air is pumped down from the surface. \u201cThe whole structure, in case of an earthquake, will vibrate together, resisting any crushing strain,\u201d declared a 1931 edition of Everyday Science and Mechanics that called the design the product of \u201cthe best engineering brains of Japan\u201d. The idea was to future-proof Tokyo against the threat of another tremor to rival the 1923 quake, which had devastated and traumatised the city less than a decade earlier. Like many fantastical projects featured in the popular technology magazines of the 1930s, 40s and 50s, the depthscraper was never likely to become reality. It remains part of unbuilt Tokyo, an alternate city of unrealised plans: some conceptual, some speculative and some derailed by economic or political shocks. Depthscrapers featured in the November 1931 edition of US magazine Everyday Science and Mechanics One of the most potentially transformative and best known of these was the Plan for Tokyo 1960 by Kenzo Tange, Japan\u2019s most influential architect and a future winner of the Pritzker prize. Tange \u2013 who had been in charge of the reconstruction of Hiroshima after the second world war and designed its Peace Centre and Memorial Park \u2013 proposed an extensive expansion of bomb-damaged Tokyo into the shallow waters of its bay. His manmade islands, bridges and floating platforms offered the capital an adaptable space for future growth and change \u2013 and an alternative to uncontrolled expansion of the city proper. Paul Dobraszczyk, a teaching fellow at the Bartlett School of Architecture and the author of Future Cities, says a number of floating cities were proposed in the aftermath of the second world war, inspired by sea forts and large pontoons developed by the military. He sees the Tokyo Bay plan of Tange, and another by the French architect Paul Maymont, as being \u201cdriven by a modernist faith in the power of technology and the mass production of building components\u201d in an effort to create \u201can entirely new type of urban environment \u2026 free from the traditional restraints of land-based cities\u201d. By the 1970s this technological optimism had waned, says Dobraszczyk. Future proposals for floating cities would emphasise organic forms and were often entirely separated from terrestrial cities. Kenzo Tange\u2019s 1960 masterplan for Tokyo. Images: Tange Architects Tokyo Bay was also the proposed site for the Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid, a 2,000-metre-tall structure with accommodation for an incredible 1 million people. The conceptual project was announced in 2004 by the Shimizu Corporation \u2013 the engineering giant behind the Aqua Line tunnel-bridge across the bay and the Cocoon Tower in Shinjuku \u2013 and featured on the Discovery Channel\u2019s Extreme Engineering series. The whole city would be built by automated robots. Its carbon nanotube struts would allow it to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis, and power would be generated from a photovoltaic coating and algae. Although the project is (very) theoretically due for completion by 2110, Shimizu is also busy with the Ocean Spiral city under the sea, a space hotel and a 250-mile belt of solar panels around the moon, so that date may be subject to change. The Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid. Image: Shimizu Corporation While unbuilt Tokyo is packed with conceptual structures and skyscrapers \u2013 such as the 4km-tall X-Seed 4000 project from 1995 \u2013 the Millennium Tower is one that might have made it off the drawing board. Designed in 1989 by the venerable British architect Norman Foster, the 840-metre steel tower was to have been divided by \u201ctown squares\u201d every 30 floors and would have featured high-speed lifts the size of buses. Helical bands around the tower were to give structural support, and water tanks at the top could be rotated as a counterweight against strong winds. It was commissioned by the Obayashi Corporation, the construction firm behind the Tokyo Skytree and the Roppongi Hills development. The company was also responsible for the Tokyo Laputa Plan for a series of 1 sq km \u201cplatform cities\u201d built six to eight storeys above ground level to relieve overcrowding and provide much-needed open space. The Millennium Tower was more serious but it was never built anyway \u2013 a victim of the city\u2019s burst real estate bubble in the 1990s. A model of the Norman Foster-designed Millennium Tower. Photograph: SSPL/Getty The American firm Kohn Pedersen Fox came up with the Sky Mile Tower, a 420-storey skyscraper, as part of its Next Tokyo 2045 proposal, which outlines ways an eco-friendly district could combat rising sea levels in Tokyo Bay. The tower would be almost double the size of the world\u2019s current tallest building, Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, and significantly higher than the 1km-tall under-construction Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia. The skyscraper would contain housing for around 55,000 people, linked by multi-level \u201csky lobbies\u201d, and feature shops, restaurants, hotels, gyms, libraries and health clinics. The design includes plans to harvest water from clouds, while farms floating in the surrounding waters help provide food for the 500,000 residents of the wider development. The Sky Mile Tower was announced in 2016 with no funding. The Sky Mile Tower was the centrepiece of Kohn Pedersen Fox\u2019s Next Tokyo 2045 project.

People in the Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey launched a campaign to find a doctor to take on the running of their local practice after Dr Katherine James announced she would be handing back her contract to run the surgery in July. Her decision came after years of trying unsuccessfully to find someone to join her as partner and help her run the surgery, which has 5,300 patients. The \u201cWill You Be My GP?\u201d campaign sought to persuade a doctor to move to the picturesque village and save its patients, many of whom are elderly, from potentially having to travel long distances for medical care. On Monday, NHS England announced that partners at Veor surgery in Camborne, 30 miles away, would add their names to the contract in Mevagissey and help run the surgery.

      "bodyText": "From the tragic case of Cecilia Samuel, found guilty of drowning her newborn baby in a ditch in Wisbech, to William Sturns, accused of stealing three cheeses, 200 years of crimes in the diocese of Ely are being catalogued for the first time. Dating from 1557 to 1775, the cases being catalogued by Cambridge University Library archivists range from witchcraft to murder, highway robbery to forgery, and trespass to vagrancy. Cecilia Samuel\u2019s brief entry reveals she was hanged for her crime; the alleged cheese thief, William Sturns, was found not guilty. In another case discovered among the collection of nearly 270 files and rolls from the Isle of Ely court of assizes, Margaret Cotte is accused of causing the death of one Martha Johnson by witchcraft, \u201cbeing seduced by diabolical instigation out of premeditated malice she did certain wickednesses and diabolical magical arts\u201d. Cotte was found not guilty in 1577. \u201cMartha and Margaret may not appear in any other records. This is all we know about them,\u201d said archivist Sian Collins. \u201cThis project enables us to hear the voices of people from all backgrounds whose names come tumbling out of the records. Many of these people, long dead and forgotten, and for whom there is no other surviving record, will now have a small piece of their story told.\u201d The region\u2019s records, which cover court proceedings and papers, including depositions, jail delivery, jury lists, inquests and examinations, are \u201cparticularly rich\u201d according to Cambridge University Library.

      "body": "<p>While farmers in much of the US spend the late spring patiently waiting for their crops to mature, a small band of sea farmers have taken to the cold ocean waters of Alaska to harvest the state\u2019s newest cash crop: kelp.</p> <p>Huge demand for seaweed, hauled up in slimy green bunches from the Pacific Ocean, has kickstarted an industry that existed as a mere fantasy only five years ago.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s lot of interest in sustainability,\u201d says Beau Perry, head of Blue Evolution, a California-based company at the centre of Alaska\u2019s nascent seaweed boom. \u201cAs we deal with climate change and the movement towards plant-based diets, all of those trends play towards seaweed being a new sort of star ingredient.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b6ee5338668879f9209b0859ad49b4e236d80e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b6ee5338668879f9209b0859ad49b4e236d80e3/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A diver inspects kelp at an aquaculture farm off Vancouver Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A diver inspects kelp at an aquaculture farm off Vancouver Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian J. Skerry/NGC/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years, farmers in Alaska have begun growing sugar kelp and ribbon kelp \u2013 two species that occur naturally in the ecosystem of remote communities like Kodiak and Ketchikan. With a $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) global market for seaweed, residents are hopeful that kelp farming is a sustainable way to cultivate \u2013 and harvest \u2013 the coveted aquatic plant.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s huge potential in Alaska. There\u2019s so much space and it really fills an interesting niche,\u201d says Alf Pryor, co-owner of Kodiak Kelp Company. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for tons of different kinds of products \u2026 [I] see it taking off pretty quickly.\u201d</p> <p>A career salmon fisherman, Pryor along with his wife, Lexa Meyer, were drawn into the kelp business recently as a way to supplement their income. But interest in kelp farming is now so intense that Pryor believes a new farmer might have to wait up to three years for the necessary permits. </p> <p>Unlike in other parts of the world, where wild kelp is harvested by ships, Alaska\u2019s aquatic plants are grown by farmers in a months-long process, which begins in the dead of winter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2824fbb1b536192f034fe12091cf46c6a493b56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2824fbb1b536192f034fe12091cf46c6a493b56/0_0_768_1024/750.jpg\" alt=\"Fisherman Alf Pryor supervises an offload of kombu\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fisherman Alf Pryor supervises a harvest of kombu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beau Perry/Blue Evolution</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Pryor and Meyer find roughly 50 plants they consider ideal for breeding, the wild kelp samples are sent to a facility run by Blue Evolution. The company extracts spores from the kelp and grows seedlings on pieces of string known as \u201cseed pipes\u201d. These pipes are given to farmers, who then wind the string along long ropes, which dangle from a free-floating frame in the ocean. Over a six-month period, the spores mature before they are harvested in late spring.</p> <p>Pryor\u2019s experience as a gill-net fisherman helped him to switch to mariculture, including redesigning a 25ft skiff to harvest kelp more efficiently. Even with his technical knowledge, he\u2019s found that farming requires constant vigilance, including a sharp eye for drifting rafts of bull kelp, rogue groupings of wild seaweed that can crash into the ropes of young kelp and tangle into the plants.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a constant battle, trying to keep stuff out of the farm,\u201d says Pryor, who monitors the young plants once a week over the winter with his team.</p> <p>In early May, the couple harvested nearly 200,000 pounds of kelp from their operation, which spans 18 acres and uses nearly 50,000 feet of rope \u2013 one of the largest hauls of kelp in the history of Alaska.</p> <p>Blue Evolution hopes to buy \u201cat least 50 tonnes\u201d of seaweed from farmers like Pryor and Meyer, says Perry \u2013 a five-fold increase on the company\u2019s purchase last year, and a figure he hopes to double next year.</p> <p>The plant is of particular interest as studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of <a href=\"http://www.publish.csiro.au/an/AN15576\">seaweed in animal feed </a>as a way of reducing methane emissions.

      "bodyText": "While farmers in much of the US spend the late spring patiently waiting for their crops to mature, a small band of sea farmers have taken to the cold ocean waters of Alaska to harvest the state\u2019s newest cash crop: kelp. Huge demand for seaweed, hauled up in slimy green bunches from the Pacific Ocean, has kickstarted an industry that existed as a mere fantasy only five years ago. \u201cThere\u2019s lot of interest in sustainability,\u201d says Beau Perry, head of Blue Evolution, a California-based company at the centre of Alaska\u2019s nascent seaweed boom. \u201cAs we deal with climate change and the movement towards plant-based diets, all of those trends play towards seaweed being a new sort of star ingredient.\u201d In recent years, farmers in Alaska have begun growing sugar kelp and ribbon kelp \u2013 two species that occur naturally in the ecosystem of remote communities like Kodiak and Ketchikan. With a $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) global market for seaweed, residents are hopeful that kelp farming is a sustainable way to cultivate \u2013 and harvest \u2013 the coveted aquatic plant. \u201cThere\u2019s huge potential in Alaska. There\u2019s so much space and it really fills an interesting niche,\u201d says Alf Pryor, co-owner of Kodiak Kelp Company. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for tons of different kinds of products \u2026 [I] see it taking off pretty quickly.\u201d A career salmon fisherman, Pryor along with his wife, Lexa Meyer, were drawn into the kelp business recently as a way to supplement their income. But interest in kelp farming is now so intense that Pryor believes a new farmer might have to wait up to three years for the necessary permits. Unlike in other parts of the world, where wild kelp is harvested by ships, Alaska\u2019s aquatic plants are grown by farmers in a months-long process, which begins in the dead of winter. After Pryor and Meyer find roughly 50 plants they consider ideal for breeding, the wild kelp samples are sent to a facility run by Blue Evolution. The company extracts spores from the kelp and grows seedlings on pieces of string known as \u201cseed pipes\u201d. These pipes are given to farmers, who then wind the string along long ropes, which dangle from a free-floating frame in the ocean. Over a six-month period, the spores mature before they are harvested in late spring. Pryor\u2019s experience as a gill-net fisherman helped him to switch to mariculture, including redesigning a 25ft skiff to harvest kelp more efficiently. Even with his technical knowledge, he\u2019s found that farming requires constant vigilance, including a sharp eye for drifting rafts of bull kelp, rogue groupings of wild seaweed that can crash into the ropes of young kelp and tangle into the plants. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a constant battle, trying to keep stuff out of the farm,\u201d says Pryor, who monitors the young plants once a week over the winter with his team. In early May, the couple harvested nearly 200,000 pounds of kelp from their operation, which spans 18 acres and uses nearly 50,000 feet of rope \u2013 one of the largest hauls of kelp in the history of Alaska. Blue Evolution hopes to buy \u201cat least 50 tonnes\u201d of seaweed from farmers like Pryor and Meyer, says Perry \u2013 a five-fold increase on the company\u2019s purchase last year, and a figure he hopes to double next year. The plant is of particular interest as studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of seaweed in animal feed as a way of reducing methane emissions. It is also being tested for properties that can mimic fossil fuels or plastics. In coastal towns like Kodiak, where the fishing industry is the main employer and incomes are seasonal, the burgeoning kelp farming industry is seen as a way for families to find work during slow periods. \u201cFor small coastal communities, [seaweed farming] could be a big deal,\u201d says Pryor. \u201cJust from the farm that we did this year, we put between 30 and 40 people to work.\u201d Alaska\u2019s experiment with kelp is nothing new: each year, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of seaweed are harvested around the world, with China and Japan leading global exports. But in recent months, the harvesting of wild plants has been dogged by controversy. In summer 2018, the proposed wide-scale harvest of wild kelp led to a fierce row in Scotland, where environmental groups say the dredging of kelp forests could cause irreparable harm to marine life off the coastline because the plants play such a crucial role in preserving a healthy ecosystem. In Alaska, companies are required to follow strict government rules on cultivation: strains of seaweed crops, taken from wild plants, must be grown within 50km of the source plant. This ensures genetic strength and diversity are maintained, says Perry, with salmon hatcheries in the state following similarly strict guidelines. On the whole, any environmental damage from the cultivation of farmed seaweed \u2013 which requires wild plants be picked for spore extraction \u2013 appears to be \u201cminimal\u201d, says Matthew Bracken, an associate professor of biology at the University of California Irvine. \u201cKelp have major benefits for the environment both naturally growing and growing in these cultures,\u201d says Bracken. \u201cWhen the sun is shining, [kelp plants] are going to absorb carbon dioxide from the water \u2026 And given increases in [carbon dioxide] concentrations in the ocean generally, this is a good thing.\u201d Because seaweed is seen as a tool for mitigating the damaging impacts of ocean acidification, Perry believes the product is good for the environment \u2013 and for business. But for Bracken, the surge in cultivation also highlights major advances in understanding the life cycle of a kelp, which has long mystified researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like plants where you just put seeds in the ground. They have a complex life. You have to really understand that well and be able to then magnify it,\u201d says Bracken. \u201cIt can teach us a lot about how life works.\u201d",

He spent nine years in jail after being convicted by a Soviet court of robbery and other crimes. When he emerged from prison he decided to go into business, first opening a hotdog stall and then founding an elite restaurant.</p> <p>The venture on a docked boat was a success. In 2001 Prigozhin personally served two guests who had stopped by for dinner: Russia\u2019s new president, Putin, and Japan\u2019s prime minister, Yoshir\u014d Mori. Soon Prigozhin was doing the catering for Kremlin banquets and for Putin\u2019s 2003 birthday party, earning him the nickname \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d.</p> <p>On good terms with Russia\u2019s elite, Prigozhin branched out.

      "bodyText": "The man behind Russia\u2019s push into Africa is a former hotdog seller who went on to become a billionaire and global Kremlin action man thanks to his close relations with Vladimir Putin. Yevgeny Prigozhin grew up in Putin\u2019s home city of Leningrad. He spent nine years in jail after being convicted by a Soviet court of robbery and other crimes. When he emerged from prison he decided to go into business, first opening a hotdog stall and then founding an elite restaurant. The venture on a docked boat was a success. In 2001 Prigozhin personally served two guests who had stopped by for dinner: Russia\u2019s new president, Putin, and Japan\u2019s prime minister, Yoshir\u014d Mori. Soon Prigozhin was doing the catering for Kremlin banquets and for Putin\u2019s 2003 birthday party, earning him the nickname \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d. On good terms with Russia\u2019s elite, Prigozhin branched out. He won lucrative state contracts to supply food to Russian schoolchildren and to its soldiers. With money came an oligarch lifestyle: a palace in St Petersburg, a yacht, a private plane, a helipad. It is Prigozhin\u2019s activities on behalf of the state that have made him notorious. According to the US special counsel Robert Mueller, Prigozhin\u2019s trolls working out of the Olgino area of St Petersburg interfered in the 2016 election. Prigozhin, senior employees and his company, Concord Catering, are all under US indictment. Prigozhin is believed to be a funder of the Wagner group, a private military contractor. Hundreds of Russian mercenaries, some tied to Wagner, were reportedly killed in clashes with US forces during a doomed attempt to seize an oil refinery in Syria in February 2018. Other mercenaries have fought for Wagner in Ukraine. Critics including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny have described Prigozhin\u2019s rise as a parable of Russia under Putin. Prigozhin has grown rich because of his proximity to Russia\u2019s forever ruler, Navalny alleges. He has nicknamed Prigozhin the \u201cking of dislikes\u201d. Leaked documents paint a portrait of Prigozhin as a hyperactive businessman and micro-manager with a flair for logistics.

It claims credit in CAR for getting of rid of politicians who are \u201corientated to France\u201d, including national assembly representatives and the foreign minister. This appears to be Charles-Armel Doubane, sacked in December. It has \u201cstrengthened\u201d the army and set up newspapers and a radio station.

Russia \u201cproduced and distributed the island\u2019s biggest newspaper, with 2 million copies a month\u201d, it adds. Rajoelina denies receiving assistance.</p> <p>Another key territory is Sudan. Last year Russian specialists <a href=\"https://dossier.center/e-prigozhin/article/prigozhinskij-otvet-doktrine-gerasimova/\">drew up a programme of political and economic reform</a>, designed to keep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/omar-al-bashir\">President Omar al-Bashir</a> in power. It included a plan to smear anti-government protesters, apparently copy-pasted from tactics used at home against the anti-Putin opposition. (One memo mistakenly says \u201cRussia\u201d instead of \u201cSudan\u201d.)</p> <p>One ploy was to use fake news and videos to portray demonstrators in Khartoum and other Sudanese cities as \u201canti-Islam\u201d, \u201cpro-Israel\u201d and \u201cpro-LGBT\u201d. The government was told to increase the price of newsprint \u2013 to make it harder for critics to get their message out \u2013 and to discover \u201cforeigners\u201d at anti-government rallies.</p> <p>In a leaked letter Prigozhin wrote to Bashir complaining that the president had not actually followed through on the advice. Prigozhin mentioned \u201clack of activity\u201d by the Sudanese government and its \u201cextremely cautious position\u201d.</p> <p>The military deposed Bashir in April in a coup. Last week Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces opened fire on pro-democracy protesters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/sudans-military-council-calls-for-snap-elections-in-wake-of-deadly-protests\">killing over a hundred</a>.

France directly controls one out of four of the Indian Ocean islands, Mayotte. In 2018 Prigozhin employees flew to Comoros via Belarus. Their objective was to test if \u201cpolitical technologies\u201d might be used to inflame the row between Paris and the Comoros government.</p> <p>Other suggestions in the documents include trans-African road and rail-building schemes. A railway could be built linking Dakar in Senegal with Port Sudan in Sudan, along the \u201cold hajj [pilgrimage] route\u201d. A separate 2,300-mile (3,700km) toll road was proposed connecting Port Sudan with Douala in Cameroon. Neither has so far happened.</p> <p>A plan to revive \u201cpan-African consciousness\u201d appears closely modelled on the idea of <em>Russkiy Mir</em>, or Russian world. The concept has become fashionable under Putin and signifies Russian power and culture extended beyond current borders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/08/documents-suggest-russian-plan-to-sway-south-africa-election\">Documents suggest Russian plan to sway South Africa election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One working paper is titled \u201cAfrican world\u201d.

It recommends collecting a database of Africans living in the US and Europe, which might be used to groom \u201cfuture leaders\u201d and \u201cagents of influence\u201d. The eventual goal is a \u201cloyal chain of representatives across African territory\u201d, the March 2018 paper says.</p> <p>More immediate practical measures include setting up Russian-controlled non-governmental organisations in African states and organising local meetings. </p> <p>It is unclear how many Prigozhin initiatives have actually gone forward. There is evidence that media projects mentioned in the documents are now up and running \u2013 albeit with marginal impact. They include a website, Africa Daily Voice, with its HQ in Morocco, and a French-language news service, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AfriquePanoramaNews/\">Afrique Panorama</a>, based in Madagascar\u2019s capital Antananarivo.</p> <p>Russian operatives also offer thoughts on global politics. One policy paper, titled \u201cRussian influence in Africa\u201d, says Moscow needs to find \u201creliable partners among African states\u201d and should establish military bases.</p>",

Russia \u201cproduced and distributed the island\u2019s biggest newspaper, with 2 million copies a month\u201d, it adds. Rajoelina denies receiving assistance. Another key territory is Sudan. Last year Russian specialists drew up a programme of political and economic reform, designed to keep President Omar al-Bashir in power. It included a plan to smear anti-government protesters, apparently copy-pasted from tactics used at home against the anti-Putin opposition. (One memo mistakenly says \u201cRussia\u201d instead of \u201cSudan\u201d.) One ploy was to use fake news and videos to portray demonstrators in Khartoum and other Sudanese cities as \u201canti-Islam\u201d, \u201cpro-Israel\u201d and \u201cpro-LGBT\u201d. The government was told to increase the price of newsprint \u2013 to make it harder for critics to get their message out \u2013 and to discover \u201cforeigners\u201d at anti-government rallies. In a leaked letter Prigozhin wrote to Bashir complaining that the president had not actually followed through on the advice. Prigozhin mentioned \u201clack of activity\u201d by the Sudanese government and its \u201cextremely cautious position\u201d. The military deposed Bashir in April in a coup. Last week Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces opened fire on pro-democracy protesters, killing over a hundred. The Russian advisers had urged Sudan\u2019s military council to suppress the activists with \u201cminimal but acceptable loss of life\u201d, one former regime source told CNN. Meanwhile, Moscow is keen to exploit a long-running territorial dispute in Comoros, the documents say. France directly controls one out of four of the Indian Ocean islands, Mayotte. In 2018 Prigozhin employees flew to Comoros via Belarus. Their objective was to test if \u201cpolitical technologies\u201d might be used to inflame the row between Paris and the Comoros government. Other suggestions in the documents include trans-African road and rail-building schemes. A railway could be built linking Dakar in Senegal with Port Sudan in Sudan, along the \u201cold hajj [pilgrimage] route\u201d. A separate 2,300-mile (3,700km) toll road was proposed connecting Port Sudan with Douala in Cameroon. Neither has so far happened. A plan to revive \u201cpan-African consciousness\u201d appears closely modelled on the idea of Russkiy Mir, or Russian world. The concept has become fashionable under Putin and signifies Russian power and culture extended beyond current borders. One working paper is titled \u201cAfrican world\u201d. It calls for a developing \u201cAfrican self-identity\u201d. It recommends collecting a database of Africans living in the US and Europe, which might be used to groom \u201cfuture leaders\u201d and \u201cagents of influence\u201d. The eventual goal is a \u201cloyal chain of representatives across African territory\u201d, the March 2018 paper says. More immediate practical measures include setting up Russian-controlled non-governmental organisations in African states and organising local meetings. It is unclear how many Prigozhin initiatives have actually gone forward. There is evidence that media projects mentioned in the documents are now up and running \u2013 albeit with marginal impact. They include a website, Africa Daily Voice, with its HQ in Morocco, and a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama, based in Madagascar\u2019s capital Antananarivo. Russian operatives also offer thoughts on global politics. One policy paper, titled \u201cRussian influence in Africa\u201d, says Moscow needs to find \u201creliable partners among African states\u201d and should establish military bases.",

The meat industry in south-east Asia is growing at an alarming rate: around 2.5 million pigs are slaughtered annually in Cambodia alone,\u201d she said. </p> \n<p>\u201cBut the laws for animal welfare are practically non-existent in Cambodia, which means these animals are left with no protection.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/death-by-clubbing-brutality-thailand-pig-slaughterhouses\">Death by clubbing: the brutality of Thailand's pig slaughterhouses</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 2016, the Buddhist nation passed its first-ever <a href=\"https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/law-on-animal-health-and-production-no-nsrkm0116003-lex-faoc173984/\">animal health and protection law</a> following the culling of thousands of animals due to outbreaks of <a href=\"https://www.cambodiadaily.com/news/blue-ear-disease-kills-more-than-1000-pigs-in-siem-reap-93558/\">blue-ear pig disease</a> and avian flu, which states that: \u201cKeepers of animals who \u2026 torture, caus[e] the suffering [of], or commit barbaric acts on animals in contrary to animal welfare technical standards \u2026 shall be subject to written warning or suspension of certificate or relevant permits.\u201d</p> \n<p>But due to a lack of modern equipment and machinery, activists believe that most livestock in Cambodia is slaughtered by hand, using similar methods to those shown in the video.</p> \n<p>Cambodia opened its first and only <a href=\"https://www.globalmeatnews.com/Article/2016/04/27/Cambodia-s-first-abattoir-readying-the-starter-s-gun\">industrial slaughterhouse</a> in 2016, at a cost of $22m (\u00a317m).

      "bodyText": "Campaigners are calling for animal welfare reform in Cambodia after exclusive footage of an open-air slaughterhouse revealed the brutal treatment of pigs. In the undercover video, taken by British animal rights campaigners Moving Animals, hundreds of the animals can be seen huddling together watching others being killed in close proximity. Shirtless workers approach each animal in pairs. One clubs the pig\u2019s head multiple times with a metal rod before sitting upon it to prevent it from moving. The other worker then slits the pig\u2019s throat. The dying animals are dragged across the bloody concrete floor, before being thrown into a boiling vat of water off-screen. \u201cThis was one of the most brutal things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Moving Animals\u2019 co-founder Amy Jones. \u201cThe Cambodian government must act immediately by implementing animal welfare laws that ensure no more animals experience such brutal killing methods. For consumers, the best way to protest against the inhumane suffering of animals is to stop paying for their slaughter altogether.\u201d The slaughterhouse, which is overlooked by apartment buildings, made local headlines last year when Peta called on the Cambodian government to stop the abuse and to implement animal welfare laws. Yet it appears no action was taken, said Jones, who used to work for Peta. \u201cThis footage shows there has been no change. The meat industry in south-east Asia is growing at an alarming rate: around 2.5 million pigs are slaughtered annually in Cambodia alone,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the laws for animal welfare are practically non-existent in Cambodia, which means these animals are left with no protection.\u201d In 2016, the Buddhist nation passed its first-ever animal health and protection law following the culling of thousands of animals due to outbreaks of blue-ear pig disease and avian flu, which states that: \u201cKeepers of animals who \u2026 torture, caus[e] the suffering [of], or commit barbaric acts on animals in contrary to animal welfare technical standards \u2026 shall be subject to written warning or suspension of certificate or relevant permits.\u201d But due to a lack of modern equipment and machinery, activists believe that most livestock in Cambodia is slaughtered by hand, using similar methods to those shown in the video. Cambodia opened its first and only industrial slaughterhouse in 2016, at a cost of $22m (\u00a317m). The 11,000 square-metre plant was designed to slaughter imported Australian cattle for export to China, but without the tax and sanitary compliance documents required for international trade, it now only operates twice a week, slaughtering fewer than 100 cattle for domestic consumption. Cambodia is not unique in its poor animal welfare practice. Humane slaughter in small- and medium-sized abattoirs across the region is virtually non-existent, says global farm animal advisor Kate Blaszak, of the international charity World Animal Protection (WAP). \u201cAcross south-east Asia, humane slaughter standards and enforcement are needed for all species slaughtered, including pigs, poultry, cattle and buffalo, as well as geese and ducks,\u201d said Blaszak. \u201cHowever, from my experience, there is little routine enforcement or even regulation for animal welfare during slaughter except large company slaughter in some countries. Thus there is no general incentive for training and compliance day-to-day for most animals in most countries.\u201d Many of the pigs slaughtered in Cambodia have been driven over the border in crowded pickup trucks from Thailand, and arrive cramped, sunburnt and dehydrated, she added. Pigs are highly intelligent and sentient animals capable of feeling intense pain and suffering, said Blaszak. \u201cLocal consumers deserve pork that has been raised and slaughtered to good welfare standards along with intrinsic benefits of good meat quality and safety.\u201d The Phnom Penh slaughterhouse kills an estimated 600 pigs every night between 11pm and 6am, said Jones, who rented a room in one of the adjacent apartment buildings to document the process. Jones and her partner Paul Healey, with whom she founded Moving Animals, said they were struck by the fact that some of the workers regularly looked away as the pigs\u2019 throats were slit. \u201cCompared to the industrial style of slaughter, which is nameless and faceless because it\u2019s done by a machine in a rapid pace, there\u2019s an intimacy to this style of slaughter between the worker who has to hit the pig multiple times over the head, and the other worker who has to slit the throat,\u201d said Healey. \u201cThe workers have to walk over to the pig they want to kill and hit it repeatedly. It really drives home the impact it must have on the workers who work there night after night.\u201d",

It\u2019s an observation director Suba Das has taken to heart in this Octagon theatre off-site production by making the connection between the age of Wilde and the dawn of photography. Jack Hardwick\u2019s suitably brittle Algernon conducts several conversations from the other side of a camera and, at choice moments, the actors are captured in freeze-frame. It\u2019s all about looking the part. It is a bonus that the painted studio backdrops of David Woodhead\u2019s set provide an efficient way of changing scene on the Albert Halls stage. The ornate ceiling and grand organ also contribute to the air of Victorian grandeur, although the production is done no favours by the high stage and unforgiving acoustics. Largely for this reason, Wilde\u2019s dazzling script gets almost no laughs. Despite the hard work of the cast, the audience has to strain to keep up with the banter.

House to see Mueller evidence in justice department shift The House judiciary committee will soon receive underlying evidence from Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, a breakthrough in the standoff between Democrats and the justice department. The deal was announced on Monday, shortly before the former White House counsel John Dean \u2013 a star witness in the Watergate investigation \u2013 told the committee he saw parallels between the scandal that ended the Nixon presidency and the Mueller report, which he called a \u201croad map\u201d for investigating Donald Trump. \u2018Principled person.\u2019 Mueller was in many ways the perfect man to lead the Russia inquiry: principled, trusted and precise.

      "body": "<p>Growing up, your parents\u2019 friends can feel like extras in the drama of your life: there, but peripheral to the action. Les was that for me. She was my mum\u2019s best friend: the giver of the ceremonial birthday \u00a35 note and bestower of strange charity-shop finds. We rarely lived in the same place. While I was in Yorkshire, she was in Bristol, and she moved north only when I went south to university. We would share a hug and a chat a few times a year. I liked her, but our paths rarely crossed.</p> <p>Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/oct/31/socialcare.obituaries\" title=\"\">my lovely, huge-hearted mum died</a>. It was a violent freak accident in a foreign country, and her death was a catastrophic rip in the fabric of our family. I was 29 and pregnant with a confused and understandably demanding one-year-old son. My sister was barely 18, my stepfather quite unwell and spent his days making and receiving endless unbearable phone calls as the news reverberated around my mum\u2019s sprawling network of friends, family and colleagues. Her many siblings flocked round, filling the house with comforting but stressful activity \u2013 small dark women I would cross on the stairs who looked so like her, but weren\u2019t. We were lost in the twilight-zone bureaucracy of sudden death; a time when there was nothing and everything to do. It didn\u2019t even feel like grief (or how I had imagined grief before experiencing it). We were just stuck in a horrible, frightening place I hadn\u2019t known existed.</p> <p>Into that stultifying fog came Les. I remember the physical sensation of relief I felt at seeing her; her hug felt like oxygen. \u201cShall we go for a walk, Em, just us?\u201d she said, and we did, walking slowly, arm in arm, around wintry York. It wasn\u2019t at all that Les stepped in and made things better. She had just had a bad car accident and was in great pain; she was in shock as much as we were. Rather, she knew how to sit with the awfulness. Like many inveterate worriers, Les is great in a crisis: when the worst happens, she was sort of expecting it anyway.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We both missed Mum terribly, but our bond seemed to soften the sharp edges</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I can\u2019t remember exactly what we said to each other that first day (I think we talked about what to call the new baby when it arrived, as well as the bare, grim facts of the moment), but I knew I could say absolutely anything without shocking or upsetting her. That created a sort of breathing space that allowed me to move on, just fractionally, to whatever was next.</p> <p>For the next year or so, Les helped more than almost anything else in small, but utterly reliable, ways: a sneaked cup of tea, or a frank, rambling phone call that got straight to the bare bones of things. Pain. Anger. Dread. Then round again, without boring or depressing each other, somehow.

      "bodyText": "Growing up, your parents\u2019 friends can feel like extras in the drama of your life: there, but peripheral to the action. Les was that for me. She was my mum\u2019s best friend: the giver of the ceremonial birthday \u00a35 note and bestower of strange charity-shop finds. We rarely lived in the same place. While I was in Yorkshire, she was in Bristol, and she moved north only when I went south to university. We would share a hug and a chat a few times a year. I liked her, but our paths rarely crossed. Then my lovely, huge-hearted mum died. It was a violent freak accident in a foreign country, and her death was a catastrophic rip in the fabric of our family. I was 29 and pregnant with a confused and understandably demanding one-year-old son. My sister was barely 18, my stepfather quite unwell and spent his days making and receiving endless unbearable phone calls as the news reverberated around my mum\u2019s sprawling network of friends, family and colleagues. Her many siblings flocked round, filling the house with comforting but stressful activity \u2013 small dark women I would cross on the stairs who looked so like her, but weren\u2019t. We were lost in the twilight-zone bureaucracy of sudden death; a time when there was nothing and everything to do. It didn\u2019t even feel like grief (or how I had imagined grief before experiencing it). We were just stuck in a horrible, frightening place I hadn\u2019t known existed. Into that stultifying fog came Les. I remember the physical sensation of relief I felt at seeing her; her hug felt like oxygen. \u201cShall we go for a walk, Em, just us?\u201d she said, and we did, walking slowly, arm in arm, around wintry York. It wasn\u2019t at all that Les stepped in and made things better. She had just had a bad car accident and was in great pain; she was in shock as much as we were. Rather, she knew how to sit with the awfulness. Like many inveterate worriers, Les is great in a crisis: when the worst happens, she was sort of expecting it anyway. I can\u2019t remember exactly what we said to each other that first day (I think we talked about what to call the new baby when it arrived, as well as the bare, grim facts of the moment), but I knew I could say absolutely anything without shocking or upsetting her. That created a sort of breathing space that allowed me to move on, just fractionally, to whatever was next. For the next year or so, Les helped more than almost anything else in small, but utterly reliable, ways: a sneaked cup of tea, or a frank, rambling phone call that got straight to the bare bones of things. Pain. Anger. Dread. Then round again, without boring or depressing each other, somehow. Neither of us slept much, so we would text in the grey early hours, a tiny flash of connection in every blunt message. We both missed Mum terribly, but our bond seemed to soften the sharp edges of it. She was somewhere in the ether between us. When my younger son was born, four months after Mum died, Les came almost immediately, arriving in the hospital the next morning. It\u2019s an almost painfully pleasurable memory: she and her wonderful husband, Rob, holding my tiny son, and beaming with almost grandparental pride.

Second, many of the items in this list are portals to further exploration: more allusions, more stories, more rabbit holes.</p> <p>Third, when I mention \u201cSebald\u201d as a person, I may be deceiving you. The narrator of this book appears to be its author \u2013 most of the time. But there are enough odd references and fantastical descriptions to make the reader suspect that the person telling these stories may be part-fiction.</p> <p>Fourth, Sebald has barely got going by this stage. As The Rings of Saturn progresses, he references a staggering number of books, facts and historical events, interrupting his text with pictures we assume he must have taken on his peregrinations. And some he can\u2019t possibly have taken. There are also historical photographs, reproductions of art works, documents, maps and illustrations. Some are explained by the text around them. Some aren\u2019t. He quotes numerous authors, but never includes quote marks. He rewrites texts in his own words. And just makes things up. He includes deliberate errors, drifts into flights of fantasy, and makes us wonder about the truth of everything. Did he really, as he writes, climb over a wire to run his hand across the \u201cdusty back\u201d of a pig? \u201cI stroked its snout and face, and chucked it in the hollow behind one ear, till at length it sighed like one enduring endless suffering.\u201d What?</p> <p>Sebald detaches us from reality, even as he feeds increasing amounts of earthy and apparently true material into the book. He makes us feel like there is far more in the Suffolk landscape than we could ever have imagined \u2013 and also that he\u2019s imagining plenty of it. Or rather, the imaginary version of him is imagining it.</p> <p>And if that sounds labyrinthine, that\u2019s the point. Sebald tells us as much, though little in The Rings of Saturn is explicit. Rather, he tells us allusively, by referencing the master of misdirection \u2013 and author of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinths\">Labyrinths</a> \u2013 Jorge Luis Borges. Floating into the narrator\u2019s head comes the story of Simplicius Simplicissimus via Borges\u2019s. One of these imaginary beasts is the Baldanders, who appears first as a stone sculpture before turning into a scribe who writes out lines in an incomprehensible language (to this reader, anyway), and then turning into \u201can oak, a sow, a sausage, a piece of excrement, a field of clover, a white flower, a mulberry tree and a silk carpet\u201d. A few pages later, the narrator thinks again of the \u201cArgentine\u201d writer and his story <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tl\u00f6n,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius\">Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius</a>, in which items from a fictional world enter our own and begin to take over.</p> <p>There seem to be lessons in these passages about misdirection, mutability, shifting perceptions, fiction and reality. They strike me as a useful guide to reading The Rings of Saturn. But I\u2019m wary of pushing things too far \u2013 I expect that as we fall deeper into the book, plenty of other ways of reading and seeing the book will suggest themselves.</p> <p>Likewise, I don\u2019t want to overcomplicate things. Looking back over this, I see a mighty battalion of references and theories. But The Rings of Saturn never feels that daunting when you\u2019re reading it. The narrative has a slow, meandering, very human feel, with thoughts coming in and out of focus, just as they do in my own mind when I\u2019m out walking. Sometimes you can try to grab on to one and try to make something of it, but it doesn\u2019t really matter if it flitters by unremarked because there\u2019s always something ahead to charm and distract us. Sure, you could spend a lifetime unpicking and categorising and wrestling with this book (and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/30154326?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">plenty of people have</a>). But you can also enjoy it in a few gentle, dreamy hours of reading. It\u2019s a world in itself.</p>",

There seem to be lessons in these passages about misdirection, mutability, shifting perceptions, fiction and reality. They strike me as a useful guide to reading The Rings of Saturn. But I\u2019m wary of pushing things too far \u2013 I expect that as we fall deeper into the book, plenty of other ways of reading and seeing the book will suggest themselves. Likewise, I don\u2019t want to overcomplicate things. Looking back over this, I see a mighty battalion of references and theories. But The Rings of Saturn never feels that daunting when you\u2019re reading it. The narrative has a slow, meandering, very human feel, with thoughts coming in and out of focus, just as they do in my own mind when I\u2019m out walking. Sometimes you can try to grab on to one and try to make something of it, but it doesn\u2019t really matter if it flitters by unremarked because there\u2019s always something ahead to charm and distract us. Sure, you could spend a lifetime unpicking and categorising and wrestling with this book (and plenty of people have). But you can also enjoy it in a few gentle, dreamy hours of reading. It\u2019s a world in itself.",

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that 79,000 retail jobs were lost in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the previous quarter, as chains close stores against a backdrop of rising costs and a shift to online shopping.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has been a turbulent year, with many well-known brands disappearing from our high streets, as has been evidenced by the substantial loss in retail jobs this quarter,\u201d said Kyle Monk, the head of retail insight at the British Retail Consortium.<strong> \u201c</strong>Political and economic uncertainty has compounded many of the challenges created by the pace of technological change.\u201d</p> \n<p>John Stevenson, an analyst at stockbroker Peel Hunt, said the scale of the profit warning at Ted Baker would \u201craise eyebrows\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWhile these issues have been brewing for some time \u2013 and the ranges were designed well over 12 months ago \u2013 there will be questions around founder Ray Kelvin\u2019s departure and the wider question of how to get Ted back on point.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ted Baker has embarked on a major efficiency drive and has also launched a number of product initiatives, including introducing more fast fashion.

      "bodyText": "The Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff says it is \u201cmost unlikely\u201d the Coalition will be able to pass its full income tax cut package in the first week of July when parliament returns, and has joined Labor\u2019s call for the government to split the legislation. Griff, who is one of two key crossbench senators in negotiations with the government over the $158bn tax cut package, said he was waiting for a response from Treasury and the Coalition after the party outlined its demands on energy policy. The party wants the Coalition to activate the existing Australian domestic gas security mechanism, which has not been used, that prevents companies exporting gas without first obtaining permission from the government. It is also calling on Treasury to examine the likely economic impact of rising energy prices on the wider economy and cost of living, fearing any income tax cut bonus would go into the \u201cpockets of overseas energy companies\u201d. He said that as negotiations with the crossbench continued on the final tranche of the tax cuts, the government could consider passing the first two stages of the package to give much-needed economic stimulus. \u201cNo one wants hardworking Australians to miss out on their tax cut, and we know that the economy needs stimulus, and parts one and two gives it stimulus,\u201d Griff said. \u201cWithout them killing everything else off the routine agenda it is most unlikely that it (the full package) is going to get through in that first week.\u201d Griff said Centre Alliance was still open to supporting the whole package, but would wait for assurances from the government that the tax relief would not be \u201cfleeced off by high power prices\u201d. \u201cWe have highlighted our concern with this, there needs to be a gas reservation policy and it is up to them (the government) to come back to us and for Treasury to come to us and tell us whether they have factored in likely energy increases in the coming years,\u201d Griff said. His fellow Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said the trigger needed to be activated as Australian companies were paying $9 a gigajoule for Australian natural gas which is sold for $7 in Asia. Patrick proposes that if the gas price in the eastern market goes above the average rate in Western Australia or Asia, the government should use the trigger and limit exports until there is \u201cat least\u201d a surplus of 5% in domestic markets. \u201cThe gas price will rise again and that will increase the cost of electricity in South Australia. \u201cPower price rises will consume the benefit of income tax cuts ... neutralising the effect of stimulus and making Australian industry uncompetitive.\u201d Patrick distanced himself from Pauline Hanson\u2019s demands for a coal-fired power station and the Bradfield scheme for inland irrigation, noting the former is \u201cquite prescriptive\u201d and the latter would cost \u201cbillions\u201d while Centre Alliance\u2019s proposal would cost the government nothing. \u201cIf the government gives a hospital to Jacqui [Lambie] or a coal-fired power station to Pauline [Hanson] that is not our concern.\u201d Labor appears to be standing firm on its demand for the Morrison government to split the bill for income tax cuts, while the Coalition is refusing to budge on its position that the package be passed in its entirety. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said if the government refused to split the legislation to ensure the first stage of relief was provided to low and middle income earners, it would be \u201cputting politics before outcomes\u201d. \u201cThe government really needs to be sensible about this. We can get through the first tranche very quickly, through the parliament, with Labor and Coalition support. That is the tax cuts that are relevant for this term of government,\u201d Albanese told Perth radio on Tuesday. While declining to comment on the Centre Alliance proposal on the gas trigger, the resources minister, Matt Canavan, said the government\u2019s existing policy had already reduced prices, pointing to a recent report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which found LNG netback prices had fallen in the past six months. \u201cWe continue to monitor domestic gas markets closely in the context of the government\u2019s announced policy to ensure that domestic markets are put first and that they function effectively,\u201d Canavan told Guardian Australia. But the ACCC\u2019s chair, Rod Sims, also warned at the time that high gas prices remained \u201ca critical issue for domestic gas users\u201d, warning that more businesses could move or close as a result. The report showed that most commercial and industrial Australian gas users will pay more than $9 a gigajoule for gas this year, and some more than $11 a gigajoule. \u201cCommercial and industrial gas users have been telling us for some time that at those gas prices, their operations are not sustainable in the medium to longer term,\u201d Sims said.",

That said, there were clear signs of improvement towards the end of the season, particularly with his crossing, and it is also worth remembering that we are talking about a player who is only 21 and has made 42 appearances in senior football for club and country. In that sense it feels as though James has come a long way in a short time, yet the journey that takes place away from the limelight is overlooked by many, though not by everyone. When Swansea Under-23s travelled to Hull in February, shortly after that barnstorming performance against Brentford, Kevan and Elaine James turned up to thank the Welsh club\u2019s coaching staff personally for the part they played in their son\u2019s development \u2013 a nice touch. Sadly, desperately sadly, Kevan died suddenly last month, not long after the wheels for the transfer to Manchester United were set in motion. DJ, as he is known to his friends and teammates, posted a heartfelt message on his Instagram account a few days ago, describing his dad as his inspiration and promising to make him proud. Kevan was already that and more.",

      "body": "<p>As the United States prepare for their opening game in the Women\u2019s World Cup on Tuesday against Thailand, it is easy to view the Americans as prohibitive favorites. <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/women/\">The US are No1 in the Fifa rankings</a>, defending World Cup champions, and boast some of the best players on the planet, with Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath spearheading their attack.</p> <p>But the Americans look at it differently. After all, a lot has happened in the four years since the Americans<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan\"> lifted the trophy in Canada</a>. In 2016, they suffered their earliest exit in a major tournament ever, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/12/hope-solo-sweden-cowards-olympics-football-rio-2016\">losing to Sweden in the quarter-finals</a> of the Rio Olympics. They have been conceding goals at a worrying clip against top-10 teams, and in the run-up to the World Cup they have failed to beat fellow contenders France, England and Japan.</p> <p>But maybe that\u2019s a good thing. Germany are the only team to have retained the Women\u2019s World Cup, and one reason other teams \u2013 including the US \u2013 have failed may be the complacency that comes with sitting at the top. The US don\u2019t have to worry about that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/10/uswnt-usa-womens-world-cup-soccer-predictions\">Shaky defenders and France's threat: our writers' US World Cup predictions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a difficult cycle,\u201d Megan Rapinoe admitted shortly after the Americans arrived in France this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve been up and down with performances and sometimes the results, not doing well coming off the 2016 Olympics. So, this group feels that motivation and desire to go and win it.\u201d</p> <p>That Olympics loss has also encouraged the team\u2019s coach, Jill Ellis, to squeeze out veterans in search of youngsters who can bring more dynamism and unpredictability. However, when push came to shove, and Ellis named her final roster for the tournament, she went with experience, giving surprise roster spots to veterans such as Ali Kreiger and Morgan Brian, who had been on the fringes of the squad. Now, just as in in 2015, the US will have the oldest roster at the World Cup.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/12/usa-womens-soccer-team-world-cup-qualifying\">Yet Ellis has tried to evolve the USA\u2019s game</a>. The players are expected to push forward from all over the field, rotate and interchange, and use counter-pressing to win possession. It\u2019s a high risk, high reward style that may leave the Americans vulnerable to counterattacks \u2013 and indeed the US conceded 10 goals in five games against top 10 teams this year.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Americans trust their ability to outscore anyone. Full-backs, including likely starters Crystal Dunn and Kelley O\u2019Hara, will bomb forward and provide attacking outlets. Julie Ertz, the defensive midfielder, will join them. The Americans will resemble a battering ram, wearing opponents down.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk that, \u2018Oh, the back line is letting in a lot of goals\u2019 but people seem to forget that the way our team plays, we commit a lot of numbers forward,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cWe really do push numbers high \u2013 not to say we can\u2019t recover, but there are risks that are taken with the way we play. We\u2019re a transition-based team and we love to go forward, especially myself.\u201d</p> <p>For years, fans and pundits have wondered whether the rest of the world had finally surpassed the US, a team that has always possessed superior grit and athleticism but not always the same technical finesse. The USA\u2019s up-and-down form, including a 3-1 loss to France to open 2019, has only increased that discussion.</p> <p>The Americans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women%27s_national_soccer_team#World_Cup\">have never failed to make the semi-finals of a World Cup</a>, and making it that far would be a reasonable follow-up for the reigning champions. But a quarter-final exit would be a disaster. Unfortunately for the US, that is a realistic scenario, especially as the draw puts them on track to face powerhouses France or Germany in the quarter-final. </p> <p>Even if group-stage results shake up the bracket, it will be tough either way. That\u2019s because no longer are the title contenders just the US and a couple of other teams. Several nations can win this World Cup, including some teams that play a more skillful, purposeful style than the Americans. England and the Netherlands, two teams who have never been considered contenders in World Cups past, are among that group. But the Americans are confident their own approach, which is just as much about a relentless mentality than any of Ellis\u2019 tactics.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about winning,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cLooking back on a game, no one\u2019s going to care about, did we connect all of our passes or did we outplay them? It\u2019s about, did we win the game?

      "bodyText": "As the United States prepare for their opening game in the Women\u2019s World Cup on Tuesday against Thailand, it is easy to view the Americans as prohibitive favorites. The US are No1 in the Fifa rankings, defending World Cup champions, and boast some of the best players on the planet, with Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath spearheading their attack. But the Americans look at it differently. After all, a lot has happened in the four years since the Americans lifted the trophy in Canada. In 2016, they suffered their earliest exit in a major tournament ever, losing to Sweden in the quarter-finals of the Rio Olympics. They have been conceding goals at a worrying clip against top-10 teams, and in the run-up to the World Cup they have failed to beat fellow contenders France, England and Japan. But maybe that\u2019s a good thing. Germany are the only team to have retained the Women\u2019s World Cup, and one reason other teams \u2013 including the US \u2013 have failed may be the complacency that comes with sitting at the top. The US don\u2019t have to worry about that. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a difficult cycle,\u201d Megan Rapinoe admitted shortly after the Americans arrived in France this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve been up and down with performances and sometimes the results, not doing well coming off the 2016 Olympics. So, this group feels that motivation and desire to go and win it.\u201d That Olympics loss has also encouraged the team\u2019s coach, Jill Ellis, to squeeze out veterans in search of youngsters who can bring more dynamism and unpredictability. However, when push came to shove, and Ellis named her final roster for the tournament, she went with experience, giving surprise roster spots to veterans such as Ali Kreiger and Morgan Brian, who had been on the fringes of the squad. Now, just as in in 2015, the US will have the oldest roster at the World Cup. Yet Ellis has tried to evolve the USA\u2019s game. The players are expected to push forward from all over the field, rotate and interchange, and use counter-pressing to win possession. It\u2019s a high risk, high reward style that may leave the Americans vulnerable to counterattacks \u2013 and indeed the US conceded 10 goals in five games against top 10 teams this year. On the other hand, the Americans trust their ability to outscore anyone. Full-backs, including likely starters Crystal Dunn and Kelley O\u2019Hara, will bomb forward and provide attacking outlets. Julie Ertz, the defensive midfielder, will join them. The Americans will resemble a battering ram, wearing opponents down. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk that, \u2018Oh, the back line is letting in a lot of goals\u2019 but people seem to forget that the way our team plays, we commit a lot of numbers forward,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cWe really do push numbers high \u2013 not to say we can\u2019t recover, but there are risks that are taken with the way we play. We\u2019re a transition-based team and we love to go forward, especially myself.\u201d For years, fans and pundits have wondered whether the rest of the world had finally surpassed the US, a team that has always possessed superior grit and athleticism but not always the same technical finesse. The USA\u2019s up-and-down form, including a 3-1 loss to France to open 2019, has only increased that discussion. The Americans have never failed to make the semi-finals of a World Cup, and making it that far would be a reasonable follow-up for the reigning champions. But a quarter-final exit would be a disaster. Unfortunately for the US, that is a realistic scenario, especially as the draw puts them on track to face powerhouses France or Germany in the quarter-final. Even if group-stage results shake up the bracket, it will be tough either way. That\u2019s because no longer are the title contenders just the US and a couple of other teams. Several nations can win this World Cup, including some teams that play a more skillful, purposeful style than the Americans. England and the Netherlands, two teams who have never been considered contenders in World Cups past, are among that group. But the Americans are confident their own approach, which is just as much about a relentless mentality than any of Ellis\u2019 tactics. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about winning,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cLooking back on a game, no one\u2019s going to care about, did we connect all of our passes or did we outplay them? It\u2019s about, did we win the game? I think the team that keeps that closest to their hearts is going to lift the trophy.\u201d If this World Cup is decided by who wants it the most, the Americans are surely contenders. It\u2019s not just the stinging loss in the 2016 Olympics that has added a push, but the gender equality lawsuit the players filed against the US Soccer Federation, which would make another rousing success on the biggest stage all the more useful. The players insist the lawsuit isn\u2019t on their minds but it clearly looms in the background \u2013 Rapinoe says the players get \u201cincremental updates\u201d about the legal proceedings but \u201cafter the World Cup our attention can go back to that\u201d. The Americans, of course, aren\u2019t the only ones playing for loftier goals. Jamaica, for instance, has been severely underfunded by their federation and are keen to prove in their World Cup debut they are worth more investment. Players from Australia used the eve of the World Cup to call out Fifa on equal pay. Even France are playing to make more in-roads in a country that locals say has always cared more about the men\u2019s team. In that sense, this World Cup feels more competitive and more pivotal than past editions. Not just because so many other teams have the talent to test the top-ranked Americans, but because more than ever, this tournament offers a chance to push its participants to a higher plateau of relevance. The stakes feel higher across the board, even as the Americans insist the pressure isn\u2019t on them. \u201cI consider France the favorites and I feel like all the pressure is on them,\u201d Rapinoe says. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to play and enjoy ourselves.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A petrochemical company owned by Britain\u2019s richest man is attempting to overrule a Yorkshire council to drill a shale gas well next to a sheltered housing development. Residents in Woodsetts, Rotherham, have crowdfunded \u00a310,000 to pay a lawyer to help them oppose the application by Ineos to carry out test core drilling on a field just outside the village. Councillors in Rotherham have twice refused planning permission for the well, citing concerns about highway safety and the lack of information on control of environmental impacts. Denying Ineos for the second time in September against the advice of their own planners, councillors said they worried about the proximity to Berne Square, which provides housing for people who are elderly or ill. Ineos, which is owned by Jim Ratcliffe, who was named by the Sunday Times as Britain\u2019s richest man, appealed to the planning inspectorate, which on Tuesday will hear the case campaigners are describing as \u201cDavid v Goliath\u201d. Ineos has a UK petroleum exploration and development licence (PEDL) for a field outside Woodsetts, which allows it to pursue a range of oil and gas exploration activities, subject to necessary drilling and development consents and planning permission. Matthew Wilkinson, from Woodsetts Against Fracking, said houses in Berne Square backed on to Ineos\u2019s site: \u201c[It] would be clearly visible from their homes. You could throw a ball and probably get very close to the well pad.\u201d Three weeks ago Ineos submitted an application to erect a 270-metre-long fence as an \u201cacoustic sound barrier\u201d to shield the estate, which has already been dubbed the \u201cGreat Wall of Ineos\u201d. Wilkinson said the fence would make residents feel trapped. \u201cIf somebody sticks a huge wall up outside your house, which it pretty much is, you\u2019re going to feel enclosed. \u201cThe \u2018Great Wall of Ineos\u2019 will act like nothing more than a prison wall to the most vulnerable people in our village, obscuring their views, reducing their light and causing stress.\u201d The Conservative government is in favour of fracking and has made it difficult for local councils to deny planning permission to energy firms hoping to frack for shale gas. To turn down a fracking application, councillors must cite concerns over traffic, noise or environmental impact, rather than an ideological objection to the process of fracking. In Rotherham, the chair of the planning board, David Sheppard, said: \u201cOriginally, the application was refused on the basis of the impact on highway safety and the impact on local residents in terms of noise and general distribution. In March 2018, the objection in relation to the impact on highway safety was withdrawn given there was not enough evidence to provide a robust case, although our other objection remains and will be made at the inquiry.\u201d Residents have put their own money up to pay experts to challenge Ineos at the inquiry. A spokeswoman for Woodsetts Against Fracking said: \u201cThey are David fighting Goliath; taking on a multinational company which puts growth and profit before people and the planet.\u201d In Woodsetts, Ineos has applied to construct a site to test a vertical hydrocarbon exploratory core well for five years. It has been designed to extract a \u201ccore\u201d sample of the rock for laboratory analysis to identify the geological characteristics of the rock and its gas-producing properties, according to Ineos. The energy firm says it wants to drill to \u201cgain scientific knowledge of what is below the surface \u2013 as has been agreed by many councils many times in the past to support the coal industry in the region. This may or may not lead to a thriving shale industry \u2026 If gas is present and can be safely extracted and flowed at commercial rates we know that this won\u2019t add costs to councils but rather provide jobs, investment and secure energy in parts of Britain that need it most.\u201d Last year the planning inspectorate overruled Derbyshire county council to grant permission to Ineos to erect a drilling rig near the village of Marsh Lane.

WAM Clothing has issued a series of \u201ccease and desist\u201d notices to several companies, including the AFL, which uses the flag on jerseys for the Indigenous round of matches. The AFL has confirmed it has been \u201cin communication with WAM Clothing in relation to the use of the Aboriginal flag.\u201d \u201cThese discussions are ongoing,\u201d the AFL spokesperson says. WAM Clothing was granted the exclusive use of the Aboriginal flag on clothing by its designer and copyright holder, the Luritja artist Harold Thomas, in November 2018. Late last week, a number of Aboriginal-owned businesses received letters from WAM Clothing, warning them them of \u201curgent action required\u201d regarding a breach of their exclusive licence, and providing three business days to stop selling clothing featuring the Aboriginal flag. \u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d the letter states.

Spark Health, an Aboriginal-owned and run social enterprise that produces clothing merchandise with the tagline \u201cClothing the Gap\u201d, received a letter on Thursday. Sianna Catullo from the Clothing the Gap project said all the profits from the sale of the clothing goes to Aboriginal health promotion and community engagement, including programs in schools, prisons and sporting clubs. Catullo said she could not understand why a non-Indigenous owned business would want to license the Aboriginal flag. \u201cWe make our merchandise for the mob \u2026 we make it for them so they can celebrate their identity and wear their culture with pride,\u201d Catullo said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make our clothes to profit. \u201cI guess the thing we\u2019re so angry about is that it\u2019s a white business that\u2019s got full licensing agreement and it\u2019s a white business that\u2019s profiting off it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what their connection to community is, but it\u2019s definitely not as strong as our connection, or that of the other Aboriginal businesses that are being hurt by it. \u201cThe flag represented the struggle and the resistance.

It is a charming portrait of a fellow with the \u201cbuild of a stork\u201d met on a walk \u2013 an \u201corganised hike\u201d. Thorpe strides lightly through the poem, describing his memories of listening to Radio 3, in supportive homage to his walking companion:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The long, serious silence of Cage.</em><br><em>I tell him how I miss his voice, even</em><br><br><em>after all these years: lying in bed</em><br><em>or cross-ankled in front of the grate,</em><br><br><em>struggling with an essay or a poem.</em><br><em>Spreading toast. Doing nothing. Life</em><br><br><em>in England, before everything went</em><br><em>for hire or askew.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Toast may get a brief mention but it is ice that is Thorpe\u2019s favoured element and that makes multiple appearances in this collection. But how long can anything be put on ice \u2013 including poetry itself? He considers mortality in outlandish forms: a cat\u2019s undisturbed skeleton in a London church (Unburied), the uncanny remains of an ice man (Fit for Purpose), the abandoned corpse of a whale in Iceland (Beached). And there is a moving poem (Hoping) about his mother\u2019s last days, in which he casts her as Hamm and Clov from Beckett\u2019s <em>Endgame</em>. It is a poem that demonstrates how much can be achieved by not overdoing it: the nailfile does so much of the work.</p> <p>Sometimes Thorpe\u2019s vocabulary can detain you (he is to language what a botanist is to flowers). Reading The Alarm, I had to look up gryke (fissure between blocks of limestone), vambrace (piece of armour for the forearm) and plackart (I\u2019m still not sure what it means).

The young talent featured includes photographer Rhea Storr, whose work looks at mixed-race identity growing up in Yorkshire; Scots band Young Fathers; fashion designers Martine Rose and Grace Wales Bonner; and Jenn Nkiru, who worked on Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s Ape Shit video. It all begins with Zak\u2019s father, Horace Ov\u00e9, who was the first black British person to direct a feature film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075098/\">1975\u2019s Pressure</a>, about a black British teenager and the racism he experiences. Zak hopes this exhibition \u2013 which includes some work never seen by the public before \u2013 will provide a reassessment of his father\u2019s legacy. \u201cI\u2019m really excited that the public will be able to see my father\u2019s work again or perhaps discover it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was such a pioneer of his time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea701afef493f82e087e65d64714837d555e43d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea701afef493f82e087e65d64714837d555e43d2/54_287_2238_2366/946.jpg\" alt=\"Ajamu, from Circus Master Series, 1997.\" width=\"946\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ajamu, from Circus Master Series, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ajamu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that Ov\u00e9 is not more widely known is symptomatic of the endemic lack of diversity in the arts, something that may now be changing.

      "bodyText": "Zak Ov\u00e9, the curator of Somerset House\u2019s Get Up, Stand Up Now, describes the exhibition as \u201ca review and a celebration of our Caribbean and African culture that has permeated and contributed to British society, and reveals how we are all the richer for it.\u201d If that description verges on the academic, the content of this showcase \u2013 which features more than 100 different artists across photography, painting, music and film \u2013 is more like an immersive portrait of black British life over the last 50 years, and the influence of this creativity across UK culture. The predominantly black contributors include artists from the Windrush generation such as Denzil Forrester, whose paintings portray life in 80s London, to Steve McQueen, Betye Saar, Zadie Smith and seminal music producer Dennis Bovell. The young talent featured includes photographer Rhea Storr, whose work looks at mixed-race identity growing up in Yorkshire; Scots band Young Fathers; fashion designers Martine Rose and Grace Wales Bonner; and Jenn Nkiru, who worked on Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s Ape Shit video. It all begins with Zak\u2019s father, Horace Ov\u00e9, who was the first black British person to direct a feature film, 1975\u2019s Pressure, about a black British teenager and the racism he experiences. Zak hopes this exhibition \u2013 which includes some work never seen by the public before \u2013 will provide a reassessment of his father\u2019s legacy. \u201cI\u2019m really excited that the public will be able to see my father\u2019s work again or perhaps discover it,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was such a pioneer of his time.\u201d The fact that Ov\u00e9 is not more widely known is symptomatic of the endemic lack of diversity in the arts, something that may now be changing. This exhibition follows Tate Modern\u2019s Soul of a Nation last year, about art in the United States\u2019s \u201cblack power\u201d era, and Wales Bonner\u2019s A Time for New Dreams showcase at the Serpentine Sackler gallery in January, which featured the work of black creatives including Liz Johnson Artur and Ben Okri.

      "bodyText": "Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was a CIA informant before he was assassinated in Malaysia in 2017, a report has claimed. Citing an unnamed \u201cperson knowledgeable about the matter\u201d, the Wall Street Journal said on Monday \u201cthere was a nexus\u201d between Kim Jong-nam and the CIA, adding that many details of his relationship with the agency remained unclear. According to the Journal\u2019s source, Kim travelled to Malaysia in February 2017 to meet his CIA contact, although that may not have been the sole purpose of his trip. But the newspaper said Kim, who was once considered the favourite to succeed his father, Kim Jong-il, as leader but fell out of favour, was probably unable to shed much light on the regime\u2019s internal politics. \u201cSeveral former US officials said the half brother, who had lived outside of North Korea for many years and had no known power base in Pyongyang, was unlikely to be able to provide details of the secretive country\u2019s inner workings,\u201d it said. The officials told the newspaper Kim had almost certainly been in contact with the security services of other countries, including China. Two women were charged with poisoning Kim Jong-nam by smearing his face with liquid VX, a banned chemical weapon, at Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017. Malaysia released Indonesian Siti Aisyah in March and Doan Thi Huong, who is Vietnamese, in May. The Journal\u2019s claims could not be independently confirmed. But Anna Fifield, the Washington Post\u2019s bureau chief in Beijing, said in her book The Great Successor: \u201cKing Jong-nam became an informant for the CIA \u2026 His brother would have considered talking to American spies a treacherous act. But Kim Jong-nam provided information to them, usually meeting his handlers in Singapore or Malaysia.\u201d The book said security camera footage from Kim\u2019s last trip to Malaysia showed him in a hotel lift with an Asian-looking man who was reported to be a US intelligence agent.

The fact that no euphemisms are being employed here only makes the idea more unexpected. In search of answers, I have signed up for cuddle therapy, a self-explanatory alternative practice that also serves as the dictionary definition of \u201chmm\u201d.</p> <p>It starts with a chat in a dark, quiet room with Rebekka Mikkola, the founder of Nordic Cuddle. Is there a special type of Nordic cuddle? One that takes place near pine, at risk of wolverine attack? No. It\u2019s just that Mikkola comes from Finland, a nation she describes as not very huggy. She holds my hand as we talk. Then we try a standing hug, breathing in unison. She strokes my back. After a while, we move on to the bed. We try a few positions, her head on my chest, then mine on hers. There is full body squeezing, leg entwining, fingertip massage. It is deeply familiar, yet also odd and disorienting to be doing this with someone I met 20 minutes ago. A few rungs below risky business, but definitely richer than a rich tea biscuit.</p> <p>Touch is our most powerful sense, as it registers physical acts in contact with our body and usually harnesses the other senses, too. We are necessarily wary of it these days, because men have been historically, well, you would have to say, not the best. Mikkola thinks, however, that we risk stigmatising platonic touch, which has been shown to reduce anxiety and increase confidence, empathy and wellbeing. Loving contact triggers the release of the bonding hormone oxytocin and boosts serotonin, as well as lowering blood pressure and strengthening the immune system, she tells me, mussing my hair. It is incredibly soothing. As we lie in each other\u2019s arms, she peppily talks about academic research and something about my vagus nerve. The problem is, I am falling into what she calls \u201cthe cuddle coma\u201d \u2013 a state of sluggish content and low brain function. Relaxed as a baby, but also as eloquent as one. I try some relevant questions and the words come out fuddled. \u201cHow does the \u2026 nice. Keep boundaried?\u201d</p> <p>Every session begins with a consultation, Mikkola explains, in which she discusses the client\u2019s history of, and relationship to, touch. It gives her a sense of who she is getting into bed with. In her 1,000 hours of practice, she has experienced nothing inappropriate. Consent is highlighted throughout \u2013 she softly says what she is going to do and asks if it is OK. I have harder-to-articulate concerns. What if it \u2026 gets weird? Mikkola readily acknowledges that touch is emotional. About 40% of the time, people weep in her arms. She can\u2019t help but be affected, too. She trains other hug therapists at Nordic Cuddle \u2013 if a client has booked with one practitioner too many times, they are encouraged to try another. </p> <p>I love a good cuddle, but for others this set up would be nightmare fuel. I think about my friend Kate, proudly hug-averse. She will give very old friends a high five once a year if they apply for a visa, but in general: anti-tactile. I wonder what she would make of cuddle therapy, so I text to find out. \u201cIs for people with damaged attachment issues. Thought of u,\u201d I explain. \u201cSweet Jesus,\u201d she replies, which is the end of the conversation.</p> <p>Touch is crucial to our biological flourishing. Is this an appropriate way to get it? Or inescapably tragic? Nordic Cuddle\u2019s clients primarily come from IT or academic backgrounds. Easy to be judgmental, but I wonder, too, about older people, bereaved people or those in ill health; those who are afforded least in the way of loving touch, but need it most. The fact is, people have always paid for intimacy, but not everyone wants to visit sex workers or sports masseurs or make multiple appointments at the salon just for the shampoo at the start. What is wrong with a competitively priced cuddle? I am not sure, to be honest. But it feels odd. And powerfully relaxing. And lovely. And odd. There are no easy answers.

Conversations will take place in people\u2019s homes; GPs\u2019 surgeries; towns and villages \u2013 and I will be joining the conversation in parliament hosted by Action on Addiction. Addiction was part of my story. A story similar to many. I hope that as inspirational stories are shared, families will feel enabled to take the necessary steps to access help, and find hope and freedom from addiction. \u2022 Caroline Flint is the Labour MP for Don Valley",

Residents refer to the animals as \u201cgrandfathers\u201d and crocodiles are honoured with shrines around the country.</p> <p>But in the last few decades, the nation has seen a more than 20-fold increase in the number of crocodile attacks. Of late, <a href=\"https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jwmg.21497\">more than one person a month</a>, in a country of 1.3 million, has been attacked by a saltwater crocodile, and more than half of the attacks have resulted in death.</p> <p>The majority of the attacks (82.5%) occur while people are fishing, according to researchers, with bathing (7.5%) and water collecting (4.2%) being the next most dangerous activities. All this presents the people of Timor-Leste with an uncomfortable question: why are their ancestors turning on them?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/13/record-number-of-crocodiles-removed-from-queensland-waters-report\">Record number of crocodiles removed from Queensland waters - report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some Timorese have turned to an answer more familiar in the world of politics than zoology: they are blaming migrants. Specifically, migrant crocodiles from Australia, which they say have swum the 700km journey to Timor-Leste and now fill the river systems and surround the island.</p> <p>Two Australian-based researchers, Yusuke Fukuda and Sam Banks, made the journey to Timor-Leste to see if this theory might be true, collecting DNA samples from the crocodile population to see if there were any Australian crocodiles among the Timorese population.</p> <p>The pair collected DNA samples from 18 crocodiles. Some were captive animals, but roughly half were sampled in the wild, using a 4-metre pole with a dart on the end.</p> <p>Banks, who is a professor of animal ecology and genetics at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, said the job had its challenges.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of finding ones you can sneak up on on foot \u2026 you certainly wanted to pick your targets a little more carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of wading in the water and sneaking up on a 4-metre crocodile.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8df55cba7893b61cac120b88dee3ac41b6f376a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8df55cba7893b61cac120b88dee3ac41b6f376a/0_525_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Banks tries to collect DNA samples from a saltwater crocodiles in Timor-Leste\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Banks tries to collect DNA samples from a saltwater crocodile in Timor-Leste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yusuke Fukuda</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banks has just got back the sequencing data from the crocodiles, though he is yet to analyse it to see if there are any matches with the database of DNA from roughly 750 Australian crocodiles that he and his colleagues have collected over the last four years.</p> <p>If there are Australian crocodiles among the local population, this will be the longest proven migration of the animal in history.</p> <p>The existence of Australian crocodiles in Timor-Leste would also confirm that Australian efforts to conserve the animal, which was on the brink of extinction 50 years ago, are having an impact on the regional population. Since it was listed as protected in 1971, the Australian saltwater crocodile population has recovered to healthy levels. Some crocodiles can live for 80 years, and with a booming population, territory can become an issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-11T04:57:38.html\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-11T04:57:38.html\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey move around, young crocodiles get kicked out by big males and are looking for new places to settle.

      "bodyText": "The people of Timor-Leste have a crocodile problem. The reptiles are revered in the island, which lies north-west of Australia in the Timor Sea. Residents refer to the animals as \u201cgrandfathers\u201d and crocodiles are honoured with shrines around the country. But in the last few decades, the nation has seen a more than 20-fold increase in the number of crocodile attacks. Of late, more than one person a month, in a country of 1.3 million, has been attacked by a saltwater crocodile, and more than half of the attacks have resulted in death. The majority of the attacks (82.5%) occur while people are fishing, according to researchers, with bathing (7.5%) and water collecting (4.2%) being the next most dangerous activities. All this presents the people of Timor-Leste with an uncomfortable question: why are their ancestors turning on them? Some Timorese have turned to an answer more familiar in the world of politics than zoology: they are blaming migrants. Specifically, migrant crocodiles from Australia, which they say have swum the 700km journey to Timor-Leste and now fill the river systems and surround the island. Two Australian-based researchers, Yusuke Fukuda and Sam Banks, made the journey to Timor-Leste to see if this theory might be true, collecting DNA samples from the crocodile population to see if there were any Australian crocodiles among the Timorese population. The pair collected DNA samples from 18 crocodiles. Some were captive animals, but roughly half were sampled in the wild, using a 4-metre pole with a dart on the end. Banks, who is a professor of animal ecology and genetics at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, said the job had its challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of finding ones you can sneak up on on foot \u2026 you certainly wanted to pick your targets a little more carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of wading in the water and sneaking up on a 4-metre crocodile.\u201d Banks has just got back the sequencing data from the crocodiles, though he is yet to analyse it to see if there are any matches with the database of DNA from roughly 750 Australian crocodiles that he and his colleagues have collected over the last four years. If there are Australian crocodiles among the local population, this will be the longest proven migration of the animal in history. The existence of Australian crocodiles in Timor-Leste would also confirm that Australian efforts to conserve the animal, which was on the brink of extinction 50 years ago, are having an impact on the regional population. Since it was listed as protected in 1971, the Australian saltwater crocodile population has recovered to healthy levels. Some crocodiles can live for 80 years, and with a booming population, territory can become an issue. \u201cThey move around, young crocodiles get kicked out by big males and are looking for new places to settle. As part of that we think that crocodiles go to remote islands like Timor,\u201d said Fukuda, a wildlife scientist for the Northern Territory state government. It could also mean a different approach is needed to deal with the Australian population. In Australia, there are roughly seven attacks a year, with 25% of these proving fatal. \u201cThere\u2019s no particular reason to think that national borders for crocodiles are the same as for humans,\u201d Banks said. \u201cIf we find out that Australia and East Timor and Indonesia are fundamentally sharing a crocodile population, and have the same issues around human-crocodile conflict, then we need to work together to come up with a regional management plan for them.\u201d Though Fukuda says there is no reason to think Australian crocodiles might be more aggressive than Timorese ones, if they were to find out the crocodiles in the area were Australian ones, this may provide some solace to the people of Timor-Leste.

I wasn\u2019t given chances and often left in an exclusion room.\u201d So says 16-year-old Mehdi, describing his experience in mainstream schools. Mehdi says that his approach to education has been transformed since he arrived at London East Alternative Provision (Leap), in Tower Hamlets. While acknowledging the reasons for his exclusion from his last school, he says he felt unsupported in mainstream schools and that teachers were more concerned with the majority of less needy pupils. \u201cHere my mindset has changed. Teachers recognise our mood changes, put us in a safe place and push us in smaller classes, which allows us to learn.\u201d This school is among those hosting the first cohort of teachers training to specialise in understanding the needs of students such as Mehdi. It is thanks to The Difference, a new social enterprise devoted to improving outcomes for the most vulnerable pupils. In the last six months exclusions have risen up the political agenda. The recent spate of knife crime, allied to growing evidence of some schools \u201coff-rolling\u201d their most needy pupils, has propelled the problem into the limelight. A long awaited review from government, published last month, highlighted action needed to tackle this challenging issue, with its most headline-grabbing suggestion that schools be held accountable for the children they exclude. Less attention was paid to another theme in the report from the former minister Edward Timpson: the urgent need to build expertise and capacity in mainstream and alternative provision schools \u2013 often known as pupil referral units \u2013 where many excluded pupils complete their education. For Kiran Gill, founder of The Difference, the current public debate is a welcome recognition of a need her organisation highlighted more than two years ago. The Difference has now recruited its first teachers, who will start placements in some of the best alternative provision in the country from September. Their aim is to support pupils at risk of exclusion by becoming experts in mental health and the emotional and psychological trauma that often underpin challenging behaviour.

Exclusions have been rising since 2013, with male pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, certain ethnic groups and those with special most likely to be excluded. Only 1% of excluded pupils get the five good GCSEs they need to access the workforce, and a study of UK prisoners found 42% had been permanently excluded from school. The first round of expressions of interest for The Difference was oversubscribed, with 200 applicants from primary and secondary schools. One of the successful applicants, David Adum-Yeboah, is giving up a faculty headship in a mainstream school to work at Leap, because he felt he didn\u2019t have the skills to deal with challenging students such as Mehdi. \u201cI have worked in schools where I wasn\u2019t exposed to many children from difficult backgrounds. It was only when I went to an inner-city school that I realised how unskilled I was about challenge and defiance,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be able to spot the issues early on and put corrective actions in place, so kids like Mehdi can stay in mainstream.

      "body": "<p>The other day, as I boarded a budget airline plane to attend a conference in Spain, I was overcome with a feeling I\u2019ve come to recognise: carbon-footprint guilt. As a PhD student, this would be my first international conference, an exciting chance to meet fellow researchers in my field \u2013 feminism and gender studies \u2013 and discuss topics we care about. But as I sat chatting casually with other academics headed the same way, I couldn\u2019t help but worry about how my short trip would harm the environment.</p> <p>My booking confirmation showed the figures: the outbound flight would release 178kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the return another 168kg. Short flights add up quickly, and airlines such as Ryanair are now ranked among Europe\u2019s top polluters. Off-setting emissions is reasonable, but it\u2019s really just a way of covering our backs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/07/diary-of-a-climate-scientist-i-see-a-mess-of-broken-icebergs-in-the-ocean\">Diary of a climate scientist: 'I see a mess of broken icebergs in the ocean'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Academic conferences present a dilemma for climate-conscious researchers and educators. If we are to be truly ethical in our research practices, we need to confront the high environmental price of the international conference circuit, which includes emissions and the wasteful use of finite resources. It can feel hypocritical to buy into this when I try to be as environmentally aware as I can in my day-to-day life. I\u2019ve stopped buying new clothes, gone vegan, given up my car, started using fairer tech and shopping at an ethical and plastic-free shop. But none of this stopped me from boarding that plane to speed up the journey. </p> <p>Travel isn\u2019t the only damaging aspect of conference culture. At registration, I was given a plastic name tag holder, badges, a pen and a guide to the local city. We have come to expect these promotional items, but they\u2019re not exactly essential. And then there is the ubiquitous event-branded cotton tote bag. A <a href=\"https://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2018/02/978-87-93614-73-4.pdf\">report</a> from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency showed that I would have to use the bag thousands of times to make it worth the resources used to produce it, yet it is currently just hanging on my bedroom door handle with various other cotton companions from universities, galleries and libraries.</p> <p>Encouragingly at my conference, the food was vegan and prepared on site at the venue\u2019s canteen. Yet there was still the looming presence of plastic water bottles at lunch, even if a sign encouraged the use of disposable cups for tea and coffee. </p> <p>Entirely eco-friendly conference models are possible, and indeed already being realised. The <a href=\"https://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/\">Nearly Carbon-Neutral</a> conference model is freely available for guidance and recommends that all proceedings take place online. The creators of the open-access concept want to challenge the traditional format, uploading videos that remain on the website as accessible resources and creating Q&amp;A sessions that allow for more discussion time than the typical \u2013 usually very rushed \u2013 question round after a panel. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/15/to-save-the-rainforest-we-need-to-work-with-the-palm-oil-industry\">To save the rainforest, we need to work with the palm oil industry | Jennifer Lucey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not only are these arrangements more sustainable than travelling across the world for a few days, they open up participation for people who cannot afford travel or obtain visas. Undoubtedly, online meetings are not the same as face-to-face debates or continued conversations over coffee, but they can create new avenues for collaboration. Equally, refraining from international travel for a symposium might also steer attention to more local dialogue. In my immediate surroundings, there are countless people whose research I know nothing about.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, reducing air travel does not necessarily have serious career consequences. Recent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311862\">research published</a> in the Journal of Cleaner Production has shown no direct correlation between flying and academic publication output. More senior male academics were found to have much higher emissions: this carbon spending could be cut, not only for the benefit of the planet but to allow those at earlier stages in their careers, or from parts of the world where international travel is less common, to have opportunities instead. </p> <p>Although universities are slowly beginning to implement green initiatives as a result of pressure on campuses, the norms that rule academic life must respond to the climate crisis threat. Academia is not isolated from the realities of an unstable world, and the effects of conference habits make this glaringly apparent.

      "bodyText": "The other day, as I boarded a budget airline plane to attend a conference in Spain, I was overcome with a feeling I\u2019ve come to recognise: carbon-footprint guilt. As a PhD student, this would be my first international conference, an exciting chance to meet fellow researchers in my field \u2013 feminism and gender studies \u2013 and discuss topics we care about. But as I sat chatting casually with other academics headed the same way, I couldn\u2019t help but worry about how my short trip would harm the environment. My booking confirmation showed the figures: the outbound flight would release 178kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the return another 168kg. Short flights add up quickly, and airlines such as Ryanair are now ranked among Europe\u2019s top polluters. Off-setting emissions is reasonable, but it\u2019s really just a way of covering our backs. Academic conferences present a dilemma for climate-conscious researchers and educators. If we are to be truly ethical in our research practices, we need to confront the high environmental price of the international conference circuit, which includes emissions and the wasteful use of finite resources. It can feel hypocritical to buy into this when I try to be as environmentally aware as I can in my day-to-day life. I\u2019ve stopped buying new clothes, gone vegan, given up my car, started using fairer tech and shopping at an ethical and plastic-free shop. But none of this stopped me from boarding that plane to speed up the journey. Travel isn\u2019t the only damaging aspect of conference culture. At registration, I was given a plastic name tag holder, badges, a pen and a guide to the local city. We have come to expect these promotional items, but they\u2019re not exactly essential. And then there is the ubiquitous event-branded cotton tote bag. A report from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency showed that I would have to use the bag thousands of times to make it worth the resources used to produce it, yet it is currently just hanging on my bedroom door handle with various other cotton companions from universities, galleries and libraries. Encouragingly at my conference, the food was vegan and prepared on site at the venue\u2019s canteen. Yet there was still the looming presence of plastic water bottles at lunch, even if a sign encouraged the use of disposable cups for tea and coffee. Entirely eco-friendly conference models are possible, and indeed already being realised. The Nearly Carbon-Neutral conference model is freely available for guidance and recommends that all proceedings take place online. The creators of the open-access concept want to challenge the traditional format, uploading videos that remain on the website as accessible resources and creating Q&amp;A sessions that allow for more discussion time than the typical \u2013 usually very rushed \u2013 question round after a panel. Not only are these arrangements more sustainable than travelling across the world for a few days, they open up participation for people who cannot afford travel or obtain visas. Undoubtedly, online meetings are not the same as face-to-face debates or continued conversations over coffee, but they can create new avenues for collaboration. Equally, refraining from international travel for a symposium might also steer attention to more local dialogue. In my immediate surroundings, there are countless people whose research I know nothing about. What\u2019s more, reducing air travel does not necessarily have serious career consequences. Recent research published in the Journal of Cleaner Production has shown no direct correlation between flying and academic publication output. More senior male academics were found to have much higher emissions: this carbon spending could be cut, not only for the benefit of the planet but to allow those at earlier stages in their careers, or from parts of the world where international travel is less common, to have opportunities instead. Although universities are slowly beginning to implement green initiatives as a result of pressure on campuses, the norms that rule academic life must respond to the climate crisis threat. Academia is not isolated from the realities of an unstable world, and the effects of conference habits make this glaringly apparent. Changing the way we organise events and disseminate research would acknowledge that PhD students and early career researchers such as myself face environmental futures very different from those of our predecessors. As we progress from a discourse of climate \u201cchange\u201d to the realities of climate emergency, every plastic bottle, tote bag and flight matters.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s nearly a decade since Kate Atkinson\u2019s gruff private detective Jackson Brodie last appeared in print. In the intervening years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/11/jason-isaacs-i-want-to-punch-walls-monster-family\" title=\"\">Jason Isaacs</a> has brought him to brooding life on screen in the BBC series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/12/case-histories-injustice-review\" title=\"\"><em>Case Histories</em></a>, named after the first Brodie book, and his creator has produced her most acclaimed historical novels, including <em>Life After Life</em> and its sequel, <em>A God </em><em>in Ruins</em>, both of which won the Costa Novel award.</p> <p>Now, after three books set during the second world war (the Costa winners were followed by <em>Transcription</em> in 2018), Atkinson has returned to Brodie and a very contemporary theme: the sexual exploitation of women and children. Ten years since we left him, now living back in his native Yorkshire, Brodie\u2019s solitary existence has been interrupted by the arrival of his 13-year-old son, Nathan, for the summer holidays. Negotiating the hazards of parenting a teenager in the modern world would be challenge enough for Brodie, whose age is left deliberately sketchy (though basic maths suggests he must be close to a bus pass), but his son\u2019s privileged existence is a constant reminder of his own youth: \u201cBy the time Jackson was 13, his mother was already dead of cancer, his sister had been murdered and his brother had killed himself.\u201d</p> <p>The weight of these early losses has always given Brodie a fierce sense of responsibility towards vulnerable children, but there\u2019s a knowingness in the way Atkinson plays with one of the conventions of her chosen genre: the lone wolf detective with the tragic past. She has never been a straightforward crime writer, and in <em>Big Sky</em>, as in the four previous Brodie novels, she gives the impression of winking at the reader, making us complicit in the recognition of cliches and expectations. The playful literary tricks that she made overt in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/life-after-life-6.html\" title=\"\"><em>Life After Life</em></a> and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/god-in-ruins-361542.html\" title=\"\"><em>A God </em><em>in Ruins</em></a> \u2013 the deliberate flagging up of her fictional constructs \u2013 have always been more subtly present in the Brodie novels. There are frequent references to crime fiction and its tropes; characters often observe that they are engaged in something that might happen in a novel or a film, often with the wry acknowledgment that life isn\u2019t really like that:</p> <p>\u201cRunning for the border, he thought, like a man in a book or a film, although he was neither, he was a man in his own life, and that life was falling apart. And there was no border to run for, unless you counted the invisible administrative one between North Yorkshire and Teesside.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/17/life-after-life-atkinson-review\">Life After Life by Kate Atkinson \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>Big Sky </em>is laced with Atkinson\u2019s sharp, dry humour, and one of the joys of the Brodie novels has always been that they are so funny, even when the themes are as dark as child abuse and sex trafficking. Brodie is hired by Crystal Holroyd, the surgically enhanced wife of a dodgy local businessman, who believes she is being followed. \u201cCrystal was hovering around 39 years old, and it took a lot of work to stay in this holding pattern.\u201d</p> <p>Crystal has overcome her own tragic past, as the victim of a historic paedophile ring involving senior establishment figures, many of whom were never named. The case is being reinvestigated on the quiet by a pair of young female detectives called Ronnie and Reggie (inevitably nicknamed the Kray twins); Reggie turns out to be Reggie Chase, who appeared in the third Brodie book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/16/crime\" title=\"\"><em>When Will There Be Good News?</em></a>, as a 16-year-old orphan who saved his life.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s nearly a decade since Kate Atkinson\u2019s gruff private detective Jackson Brodie last appeared in print. In the intervening years, Jason Isaacs has brought him to brooding life on screen in the BBC series Case Histories, named after the first Brodie book, and his creator has produced her most acclaimed historical novels, including Life After Life and its sequel, A God in Ruins, both of which won the Costa Novel award. Now, after three books set during the second world war (the Costa winners were followed by Transcription in 2018), Atkinson has returned to Brodie and a very contemporary theme: the sexual exploitation of women and children. Ten years since we left him, now living back in his native Yorkshire, Brodie\u2019s solitary existence has been interrupted by the arrival of his 13-year-old son, Nathan, for the summer holidays. Negotiating the hazards of parenting a teenager in the modern world would be challenge enough for Brodie, whose age is left deliberately sketchy (though basic maths suggests he must be close to a bus pass), but his son\u2019s privileged existence is a constant reminder of his own youth: \u201cBy the time Jackson was 13, his mother was already dead of cancer, his sister had been murdered and his brother had killed himself.\u201d The weight of these early losses has always given Brodie a fierce sense of responsibility towards vulnerable children, but there\u2019s a knowingness in the way Atkinson plays with one of the conventions of her chosen genre: the lone wolf detective with the tragic past. She has never been a straightforward crime writer, and in Big Sky, as in the four previous Brodie novels, she gives the impression of winking at the reader, making us complicit in the recognition of cliches and expectations. The playful literary tricks that she made overt in Life After Life and A God in Ruins \u2013 the deliberate flagging up of her fictional constructs \u2013 have always been more subtly present in the Brodie novels. There are frequent references to crime fiction and its tropes; characters often observe that they are engaged in something that might happen in a novel or a film, often with the wry acknowledgment that life isn\u2019t really like that: \u201cRunning for the border, he thought, like a man in a book or a film, although he was neither, he was a man in his own life, and that life was falling apart. And there was no border to run for, unless you counted the invisible administrative one between North Yorkshire and Teesside.\u201d Big Sky is laced with Atkinson\u2019s sharp, dry humour, and one of the joys of the Brodie novels has always been that they are so funny, even when the themes are as dark as child abuse and sex trafficking. Brodie is hired by Crystal Holroyd, the surgically enhanced wife of a dodgy local businessman, who believes she is being followed. \u201cCrystal was hovering around 39 years old, and it took a lot of work to stay in this holding pattern.\u201d Crystal has overcome her own tragic past, as the victim of a historic paedophile ring involving senior establishment figures, many of whom were never named. The case is being reinvestigated on the quiet by a pair of young female detectives called Ronnie and Reggie (inevitably nicknamed the Kray twins); Reggie turns out to be Reggie Chase, who appeared in the third Brodie book, When Will There Be Good News?, as a 16-year-old orphan who saved his life. Her investigation begins to dovetail with Brodie\u2019s, leading them to a showdown with a trafficking organisation that links all the novel\u2019s disparate characters. If Atkinson relies heavily on coincidence, that too is entirely deliberate; \u201ca coincidence is just an explanation waiting to happen\u201d, is a favourite adage of Brodie\u2019s. These have always been novels about character, and there are enough moments of tenderness between parents and children to balance out the cruelty inflicted on the young. Anyone familiar with Atkinson\u2019s work will know not to look for easy resolutions or happy endings. \u201cHistory repeating itself,\u201d Jackson observes towards the end. \u201cBut then that was all that history ever did, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d There is one particularly pleasing incident of narrative justice, however; one of the men finally arrested in the historic abuse case is a peer of the realm, \u201ca veteran and vocal anti-Europe campaigner\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The year 1969 was a true inflection point for the American western, a once-dominant genre that had become a casualty of the culture, particularly when Vietnam had rendered the moral clarity of white hats and black hats obsolete. A handful of westerns were released by major studios that year, including forgettable or regrettable star vehicles for Burt Reynolds (Sam Whiskey) and Clint Eastwood (Paint Your Wagon), who were trying to revitalize the genre with a touch of whimsy. But 50 years later, three very different films have endured: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Wild Bunch and True Grit. Together, they represented the past, present and future of the western.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/24/midnight-cowboy-50th-anniversary-x-rated-best-picture-winner\">Midnight Cowboy at 50: why the X-rated best picture winner endures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the present, there was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the year\u2019s runaway box-office smash, grossing more than the counterculture duo of Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, the second- and third-place finishers, combined. George Roy Hill\u2019s hip western-comedy, scripted by William Goldman and starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, turned a story of outlaw bank robbers into a knowing and cheerfully sardonic entertainment that felt attuned to modern sensibilities. Sam Peckinpah\u2019s Wild Bunch predicted a future of revisionist westerns, full of grizzled antiheroes, great spasms of stylized violence, and the messy inevitability of unhappy endings. A whiff of death from a genre in decline.</p> <p>By contrast, True Grit looks like it could have been released 10, 20 or 30 years earlier, and with many of the same people working behind and in front of the camera. Its legendary producer, Hal B Wallis, was the driving force behind such Golden Age classics as Casablanca and The Adventures of Robin Hood, and his director, Henry Hathaway, cut his teeth as Cecil B DeMille\u2019s assistant on 1923\u2019s Ben Hur before spending decades making studio westerns, including a 1932 debut (Heritage of the Desert) that gave Randolph Scott his start and seven films with Gary Cooper. And then, of course, there\u2019s John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn, stretching himself enough to win his only Oscar for best actor, but drawing heavily on his own pre-established iconography. It was, for him, a well-earned victory lap.</p> <p>True Grit may be defiantly old-fashioned and stodgy when considered against the films of the day, but it\u2019s also an example of how durable the genre actually was \u2013 and how it would be again in 2010, when the Coen brothers took their own crack at Charles Portis\u2019s 1968 novel and produced the biggest hit of their careers. What would be more escapist than ducking into a movie theater in the summer of \u201969 and stepping into a time machine where John Wayne is a big star, answering a call to adventure across a beautiful Technicolor expanse of mountains and prairies?

      "bodyText": "The year 1969 was a true inflection point for the American western, a once-dominant genre that had become a casualty of the culture, particularly when Vietnam had rendered the moral clarity of white hats and black hats obsolete. A handful of westerns were released by major studios that year, including forgettable or regrettable star vehicles for Burt Reynolds (Sam Whiskey) and Clint Eastwood (Paint Your Wagon), who were trying to revitalize the genre with a touch of whimsy. But 50 years later, three very different films have endured: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Wild Bunch and True Grit. Together, they represented the past, present and future of the western. In the present, there was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the year\u2019s runaway box-office smash, grossing more than the counterculture duo of Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, the second- and third-place finishers, combined. George Roy Hill\u2019s hip western-comedy, scripted by William Goldman and starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, turned a story of outlaw bank robbers into a knowing and cheerfully sardonic entertainment that felt attuned to modern sensibilities. Sam Peckinpah\u2019s Wild Bunch predicted a future of revisionist westerns, full of grizzled antiheroes, great spasms of stylized violence, and the messy inevitability of unhappy endings. A whiff of death from a genre in decline. By contrast, True Grit looks like it could have been released 10, 20 or 30 years earlier, and with many of the same people working behind and in front of the camera. Its legendary producer, Hal B Wallis, was the driving force behind such Golden Age classics as Casablanca and The Adventures of Robin Hood, and his director, Henry Hathaway, cut his teeth as Cecil B DeMille\u2019s assistant on 1923\u2019s Ben Hur before spending decades making studio westerns, including a 1932 debut (Heritage of the Desert) that gave Randolph Scott his start and seven films with Gary Cooper. And then, of course, there\u2019s John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn, stretching himself enough to win his only Oscar for best actor, but drawing heavily on his own pre-established iconography. It was, for him, a well-earned victory lap. True Grit may be defiantly old-fashioned and stodgy when considered against the films of the day, but it\u2019s also an example of how durable the genre actually was \u2013 and how it would be again in 2010, when the Coen brothers took their own crack at Charles Portis\u2019s 1968 novel and produced the biggest hit of their careers. What would be more escapist than ducking into a movie theater in the summer of \u201969 and stepping into a time machine where John Wayne is a big star, answering a call to adventure across a beautiful Technicolor expanse of mountains and prairies? The film has much more sophistication than the average throwback, but the search for justice across Indian Territory is uncomplicated and righteous, and the half-contentious/half-sentimental relationship between a plucky teenager and an irascible old coot grounds it in the tried-and-true. The defiant message here is: this can still work! And boy does it ever.

Wellbeing is more telling | Dan Button</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis budget responds to New Zealanders\u2019 values. Yes, we want to be a prosperous country, of course we do, but we also care about who shares in that prosperity and how it is sustainable,\u201d says Robertson, 47. \u201cI genuinely think people\u2019s sense of wellbeing is about the broader sense of the community, of the environment, and of their family and the people around them.\u201d</p> <p>He describes the overhaul as a \u201cchallenging\u201d task, but strongly believes it has resulted in better spending decisions, with every penny allocated having the broader wellbeing of New Zealanders in mind. \u201cIt does require a different mindset,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cOne of the reasons we [increased spending] is that once you go down this path, you are going to discover huge unmet need.\u201d</p> <p>Big winners in the wellbeing budget include a record NZ$1.9bn (\u00a3980m) investment for mental health, NZ$1bn for child wellness, as well as a record NZ$320m domestic and sexual violence package. The country has some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/new-zealands-most-shameful-secret-we-have-normalised-child-poverty\" title=\"\">highest rates of child poverty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/26/new-zealand-paid-domestic-violence-leave-jan-logie\" title=\"\">domestic violence in the Organisation for Economic Co</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/26/new-zealand-paid-domestic-violence-leave-jan-logie\" title=\"\">operation and Development (OECD),</a>as well as the highest youth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/we-have-to-start-talking-about-it-new-zealand-suicide-rates-hit-record-high\" title=\"\">suicide rate</a>. </p> <p>Robertson says past governments didn\u2019t value wellbeing in the race for GDP growth, and investments are not only social, but include significant increases for the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Housing, as well as a record NZ$1bn for KiwiRail \u2013 part of the government\u2019s plan to be carbon-neutral by 2050.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you're acutely mentally unwell, there are good services. But if you're mildly or moderately ill, we can't support you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe constant refrain was, if we\u2019ve got this so-called rockstar economy, how is it that we have the worst homelessness in the OECD? How is it that you can\u2019t swim in most of New Zealand\u2019s rivers and lakes? How is it that child poverty had grown to the extent it has?\u201d Robertson says.</p> <p>\u201cThe answer, in my view, was because the government wasn\u2019t sufficiently valuing those things. And if it wasn\u2019t being valued properly, it wasn\u2019t being measured, and if it wasn\u2019t being measured, it wasn\u2019t being done.\u201d</p> <p>Frontline services for mental health \u2013 practitioners in every GP practice, student health centres and clinics for Indigenous New Zealanders \u2013 will cost the government NZ$0.5bn, equivalent to NZ$380 of mental health funding for every citizen.

      "bodyText": "Last month the New Zealand finance minister, Grant Robertson, unveiled a major shake-up of his country\u2019s annual budget. For the first time the budget puts social wellbeing indicators ahead of GDP when it comes to spending decisions. From now on, the health of New Zealand will not be measured by economic growth alone but instead by the overall wellbeing of its nearly 5 million people. The wellbeing budget was promised last year by the left-leaning Labour coalition government, and is a passion project for Robertson and the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. The two \u2013 who are close friends \u2013 have been united in their commitment to improving the lives of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people, who they say have been left behind in the race for GDP growth. \u201cThis budget responds to New Zealanders\u2019 values. Yes, we want to be a prosperous country, of course we do, but we also care about who shares in that prosperity and how it is sustainable,\u201d says Robertson, 47. \u201cI genuinely think people\u2019s sense of wellbeing is about the broader sense of the community, of the environment, and of their family and the people around them.\u201d He describes the overhaul as a \u201cchallenging\u201d task, but strongly believes it has resulted in better spending decisions, with every penny allocated having the broader wellbeing of New Zealanders in mind. \u201cIt does require a different mindset,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cOne of the reasons we [increased spending] is that once you go down this path, you are going to discover huge unmet need.\u201d Big winners in the wellbeing budget include a record NZ$1.9bn (\u00a3980m) investment for mental health, NZ$1bn for child wellness, as well as a record NZ$320m domestic and sexual violence package. The country has some of the highest rates of child poverty and domestic violence in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),as well as the highest youth suicide rate. Robertson says past governments didn\u2019t value wellbeing in the race for GDP growth, and investments are not only social, but include significant increases for the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Housing, as well as a record NZ$1bn for KiwiRail \u2013 part of the government\u2019s plan to be carbon-neutral by 2050. \u201cThe constant refrain was, if we\u2019ve got this so-called rockstar economy, how is it that we have the worst homelessness in the OECD? How is it that you can\u2019t swim in most of New Zealand\u2019s rivers and lakes? How is it that child poverty had grown to the extent it has?\u201d Robertson says. \u201cThe answer, in my view, was because the government wasn\u2019t sufficiently valuing those things. And if it wasn\u2019t being valued properly, it wasn\u2019t being measured, and if it wasn\u2019t being measured, it wasn\u2019t being done.\u201d Frontline services for mental health \u2013 practitioners in every GP practice, student health centres and clinics for Indigenous New Zealanders \u2013 will cost the government NZ$0.5bn, equivalent to NZ$380 of mental health funding for every citizen. The aim is to help \u201cthe missing middle\u201d: the New Zealanders struggling with widespread and growing rates of mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety. \u201cIf you are acutely mentally unwell in New Zealand, there are good services available to you. But if you\u2019re at the mild-to-moderate end of the spectrum, we do not have the services to support you,\u201d Robertson says bluntly. Should the UK follow suit? After all, the Welsh government\u2019s 2015 Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, requires public bodies in Wales to take into account the social, cultural, environmental and economic impact of decisions. \u201cI think this approach could be applied anywhere,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cWhat I haven\u2019t seen anywhere before is the end-to-end nature. Its no good just having a scorecard of different indicators of success. Its also using that information to inform your investments \u2013 that\u2019s how it becomes a true wellbeing budget.\u201d Robertson\u2019s view of wellbeing includes living a balanced, purposeful and meaningful life. He says he has nailed the last two, but is currently struggling with \u201cbalance\u201d. He\u2019d like to cook more for friends and family, and get to the gym. He\u2019s had his own struggles with poor mental health too. \u201cI think of my own experience as a teenager coming to terms with being gay, I definitely had quite big struggles then. I really wasn\u2019t coping at certain points of my teenage years,\u201d remembers Robertson, who now has a long-term partner. \u201cI had one particular incident involving alcohol that was very, very dangerous. And had the potential to end my life.\u201d The finance minister says there is a lot more to do. Next year\u2019s budget will apply wellbeing principles to \u201ccore baseline spending\u201d. That means schools funding, acute hospital services, and roads and transport spending. Robertson says there\u2019s no going back \u2013 at least on his watch. \u201cI strongly believe this is a much better set of budget documents than we would have produced if we\u2019d just stuck to the tried and true,\u201d says Robertson. \u201cThe way we\u2019re talking very much reflects M\u0101ori and Pasifika world views \u2013 that your wellbeing is made up of a holistic idea.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 47.

Critics contend that the far-reaching climate agenda is far too concerned with extraneous issues such as jobs, infrastructure, housing, healthcare and civil and indigenous rights. Stick to greenhouse gases, they say; reforming the energy system is utopian enough.</p> <p>This criticism crosses the aisle among elites. In February, the New York Times editorial board <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/opinion/green-new-deal-climate-democrats.html\">wondered</a> whether addressing the climate crisis was \u201cmerely a cover for a wish-list of progressive policies and a not-so-subtle effort to move the Democratic Party to the left?\u201d A day later, the Washington Post editorial board <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-a-green-new-deal-heres-a-better-one/2019/02/24/2d7e491c-36d2-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.4c9e2eb39306\">opined</a> that serious policymakers should not \u201cmuddle\u201d decarbonization with social programs that \u201cdivert money and attention from the primary mission\u201d. And in a widely circulated 11,000-word Open Letter to Green New Dealers, Jerry Taylor, the president of the Niskanen Center, a pro-market environmental group, was <a href=\"https://niskanencenter.org/blog/an-open-letter-to-green-new-dealers/\">incredulous</a>. \u201cThe Green New Deal resolution quite literally gives a nod to every single last policy demand forwarded by the Democratic Socialists of America,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe climate is too important to be held hostage to political commitments.\u201d The general gist of all this: <em>take your social justice agenda elsewhere, activists. It has no place in serious climate policy</em>.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing: social justice concerns are always intertwined with public policy \u2013 and absolutely central to climate policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4162\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/nov/25/carbon-free-energy-industry-transition\">agree</a> that we must quickly deploy vast resources to mitigate and adapt to global warming. If the United States aims to shift to 100% clean and renewable energy, we will need to build solar and wind farms across the country along with a national grid to connect them. Such a transformative investment could create a boom in jobs. But who would those jobs go to? Where would we build all of this new, green infrastructure, and who should own it? Which communities get energy first? How do we keep it affordable?</p> <p>And that\u2019s just the energy sector. To decarbonize our economy, we must make equally challenging choices across many other sectors \u2013 transportation, agriculture, buildings, manufacturing. In this vast and tangled web of society-wide choices, questions of social justice are everywhere.</p> <p>Up until now, legislators have mostly made these decisions in ways that harm communities of color, working families and the poor. We build much of our polluting infrastructure \u2013 power plants, industrial sites, highways and waste facilities \u2013 in these communities. As a consequence, African Americans are nearly <a href=\"https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=15\">three times</a> more likely to die from asthma-related causes than white people. <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/LatinoAirReport.pdf\">Nearly half</a> of Latinos live in counties where air quality does not meet EPA clean air standards. Indigenous communities like the Navajo nation live with the residual effects of uranium pollution in their water, exposing as many as <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/navajo-nation-uranium-cleanup\">54,000</a> Navajos to harm \u2013 and that\u2019s just one tribe.</p> <p>At the same time, the climate crisis is a driver of injustice, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Communities of color number among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they live in areas at higher risk of wildfires and flooding \u2013 often without basic economic protections like insurance. In New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina displaced 75,000 African Americans and <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/katrina-washed-away-new-orleanss-black-middle-class/\">hollowed out</a> the city\u2019s black middle class, which has never recovered. Today, the city\u2019s black population is smaller and poorer. Similar dynamics are at play in Houston, where a year after Hurricane Harvey the poorest communities \u2013 primarily Latino and black \u2013 have been the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/us/hurricane-harvey-houston.html\">slowest to recover</a>.</p> <p>All of this should have major implications for how we write and implement policy. The Green New Deal, which envisions a society where people have universal access to energy, jobs, healthcare and housing, is a call for renewed commitment to the equal distribution of opportunity and justice \u2013 fundamental tenets of the social contract that have languished for far too long. It\u2019s about investing in the communities polluted and left behind by the fossil fuel economy because these are the places with the highest levels of toxicity to clean up, but also because this is the right thing to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elizabeth Warren unveiled a $2tn green manufacturing platform that included explicit commitments to unions and communities of color</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For all the naysayers\u2019 hand-wringing, it appears that social justice has found a home in climate policy \u2013 at least with some. Last week, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a $2tn <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-green-manufacturing-plan-for-america-fc0ad53ab614\">green manufacturing platform</a> that included explicit commitments to unions and communities of color. The same day, Joe Biden, previously noted for his Green New Deal skepticism, did an about-face, putting out a <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/climate/\">platform</a> that cited the Green New Deal resolution and included an entire section dedicated to environmental justice. The next day, Jay Inslee \u2013 the governor of Washington, who is running a climate-focused campaign for president \u2013 published a 50-page <a href=\"https://jayinslee.com/issues/global-climate\">foreign policy package</a> that included an extensive examination of the United States\u2019 responsibility to the Global South and to climate refugees. This came on the heels of his <a href=\"https://www.jayinslee.com/issues/evergreen-economy\">Evergreen Economy Plan</a>, which focused on the role of justice in a clean energy economy.</p> <p>Public opinion, too, is shifting in favor of policies that link climate action with social justice. New <a href=\"https://listserv.wustl.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind1906A&amp;L=POLMETH&amp;P=6406\">data</a> compiled by political scientist James Stimson of the University of North Carolina shows that Americans are more supportive of liberal \u201cbig government\u201d than they have been at any time since 1961 \u2013 the days of the New Deal and the Great Society.

      "bodyText": "If you set aside Republicans\u2019 obsession with cow farts, perhaps the most prevalent criticism of the Green New Deal is its emphasis on social justice. Critics contend that the far-reaching climate agenda is far too concerned with extraneous issues such as jobs, infrastructure, housing, healthcare and civil and indigenous rights. Stick to greenhouse gases, they say; reforming the energy system is utopian enough. This criticism crosses the aisle among elites. In February, the New York Times editorial board wondered whether addressing the climate crisis was \u201cmerely a cover for a wish-list of progressive policies and a not-so-subtle effort to move the Democratic Party to the left?\u201d A day later, the Washington Post editorial board opined that serious policymakers should not \u201cmuddle\u201d decarbonization with social programs that \u201cdivert money and attention from the primary mission\u201d. And in a widely circulated 11,000-word Open Letter to Green New Dealers, Jerry Taylor, the president of the Niskanen Center, a pro-market environmental group, was incredulous. \u201cThe Green New Deal resolution quite literally gives a nod to every single last policy demand forwarded by the Democratic Socialists of America,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe climate is too important to be held hostage to political commitments.\u201d The general gist of all this: take your social justice agenda elsewhere, activists. It has no place in serious climate policy. But here\u2019s the thing: social justice concerns are always intertwined with public policy \u2013 and absolutely central to climate policy. Experts agree that we must quickly deploy vast resources to mitigate and adapt to global warming. If the United States aims to shift to 100% clean and renewable energy, we will need to build solar and wind farms across the country along with a national grid to connect them. Such a transformative investment could create a boom in jobs. But who would those jobs go to? Where would we build all of this new, green infrastructure, and who should own it? Which communities get energy first? How do we keep it affordable? And that\u2019s just the energy sector. To decarbonize our economy, we must make equally challenging choices across many other sectors \u2013 transportation, agriculture, buildings, manufacturing. In this vast and tangled web of society-wide choices, questions of social justice are everywhere. Up until now, legislators have mostly made these decisions in ways that harm communities of color, working families and the poor. We build much of our polluting infrastructure \u2013 power plants, industrial sites, highways and waste facilities \u2013 in these communities. As a consequence, African Americans are nearly three times more likely to die from asthma-related causes than white people. Nearly half of Latinos live in counties where air quality does not meet EPA clean air standards. Indigenous communities like the Navajo nation live with the residual effects of uranium pollution in their water, exposing as many as 54,000 Navajos to harm \u2013 and that\u2019s just one tribe. At the same time, the climate crisis is a driver of injustice, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Communities of color number among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because they live in areas at higher risk of wildfires and flooding \u2013 often without basic economic protections like insurance. In New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina displaced 75,000 African Americans and hollowed out the city\u2019s black middle class, which has never recovered. Today, the city\u2019s black population is smaller and poorer. Similar dynamics are at play in Houston, where a year after Hurricane Harvey the poorest communities \u2013 primarily Latino and black \u2013 have been the slowest to recover. All of this should have major implications for how we write and implement policy. The Green New Deal, which envisions a society where people have universal access to energy, jobs, healthcare and housing, is a call for renewed commitment to the equal distribution of opportunity and justice \u2013 fundamental tenets of the social contract that have languished for far too long. It\u2019s about investing in the communities polluted and left behind by the fossil fuel economy because these are the places with the highest levels of toxicity to clean up, but also because this is the right thing to do. For all the naysayers\u2019 hand-wringing, it appears that social justice has found a home in climate policy \u2013 at least with some. Last week, Elizabeth Warren unveiled a $2tn green manufacturing platform that included explicit commitments to unions and communities of color. The same day, Joe Biden, previously noted for his Green New Deal skepticism, did an about-face, putting out a platform that cited the Green New Deal resolution and included an entire section dedicated to environmental justice. The next day, Jay Inslee \u2013 the governor of Washington, who is running a climate-focused campaign for president \u2013 published a 50-page foreign policy package that included an extensive examination of the United States\u2019 responsibility to the Global South and to climate refugees. This came on the heels of his Evergreen Economy Plan, which focused on the role of justice in a clean energy economy. Public opinion, too, is shifting in favor of policies that link climate action with social justice. New data compiled by political scientist James Stimson of the University of North Carolina shows that Americans are more supportive of liberal \u201cbig government\u201d than they have been at any time since 1961 \u2013 the days of the New Deal and the Great Society. And in new polling, Data for Progress, a left-leaning thinktank where I work, finds robust support for the Green New Deal nationally, including support for policies that prioritize social justice and investment in communities of color. Yet some pundits and politicians \u2013 like the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, who is working behind the scenes to remove economic justice provisions from the state\u2019s new Climate and Community Protection Act \u2013 are still trying to reject this reality. Surveying a landscape of environmental racism and intransigent inequality, one wonders if opinion leaders and policymakers with the privilege not to think about these problems are looking at anything other than old theories, bad data and one another when they suggest that climate policy be separated from questions of redistribution. Non-elites experience policy through their daily lives, their monthly energy bill, their paycheck and the quality of their neighborhood, not through the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere or share of renewables on the grid. Elites who divorce climate policy from social justice and the people it is meant to help are almost as out of touch as those who deny climate science altogether.",

      "bodyText": "Many Americans agree on the urgent need to defeat Trump in 2020. But what kind of candidate can do it? Media pundits and Democratic Party insiders would have us believe that the path to the White House passes through the political center. While dismissing challenges from the party\u2019s left wing, Democratic elites are also writing off large swathes of the country as irredeemable Republican bastions. Despite the ultimately disastrous results of this approach in 2016, Joe Biden\u2019s currently high polling numbers imply that a number of voters buy into this logic. But the recent surge of teachers\u2019 strikes across the United States, from Los Angeles to Arizona, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, powerfully demonstrates what recent research has found: that a progressive, bipartisan working-class majority already exists in the US. Mobilizing that majority requires that Democrats present a viable alternative to a discredited status quo. The real winning strategy in the race for president won\u2019t be a centrist one \u2013 it will be a bold anti-corporate campaign oriented around working people\u2019s most pressing needs. In 2018 and again in 2019, millions of teachers, parents, and students in conservative states, including massive numbers of Republicans and independents, participated in walkouts to demand major pay raises, increased funding for schools, and an end to billionaire-funded privatization schemes. Many of the strikers belonged to the \u201cwhite working class\u201d that liberal elites wrongly blamed for Trump\u2019s election. When given the opportunity to fight for an issue that directly affected them or their children, educators and parents \u2014 white, Latino, and African American alike \u2014 put partisan labels aside and supported illegal strikes to protest Republican legislators and the corporations that benefited from their anti-tax, anti-education policies. Due in large part to massive public support, the strikes won victory after victory. Significantly, this upsurge began in West Virginia, a state that Trump swept in 2016. The teacher and strike leader Emily Comer recently explained to me why this development shouldn\u2019t have come as such a surprise: \u201cPeople are desperate in West Virginia. But the national media hasn\u2019t been paying attention to the conditions in our state that made the election of Donald Trump possible \u2013 the exact same conditions that made our strike possible.\u201d For years, Democratic leaders have willfully ignored poll after poll illustrating that a majority of people across the country \u2013 including in the south \u2013 support taxing the rich and corporations to radically improve public schools, health care, infrastructure, and other social services. Nor is this progressive majority limited to economic issues. In recent polls, 75% of Americans said they believe immigration is good for the country, only 29% said it should be decreased, and 64% said that racism is a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in the United States. Far from being deeply divided into blue and red states, the most significant division in the US is between the majority who work to survive and a small minority of billionaires who profit off our labor. There is a massive, and mostly untapped, reservoir of support for independent working-class politics in this country. Raising the specter of the electorate\u2019s purported conservatism has long served as a convenient justification for the Democratic party\u2019s stubborn refusal to embrace redistributionist policies. But winning in 2020 will require inspiring and organizing millions of workers who have been rightfully disenchanted with business-as-usual. Running yet another corporate Democrat would play straight into the hands of the right.

The students would also be aware that another founder of the university and St Paul\u2019s College, Robert Allwood, benefited significantly from the proceeds of slavery. Discuss. Australia is not beyond renaming electorates that have honoured killers of Aboriginal people. Australian universities have done the same with buildings. New plaques have, meanwhile, been attached to old statues to illuminate the truth about their subjects. More importantly: new statues should be erected to worthier figures that Australian historiography overlooks \u2013 not least, Indigenous people and women. Bring them on. In challenging the orthodoxies of Australian history through Wentworth Must Fall, the University of Sydney students, active on the issue unlike generations of their predecessors subject to the colonial fairytale, should be lauded rather than condemned with reactionary outrage and harrumphing. Regardless of whether Wentworth stands or falls. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist \u2022 Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article",

When it comes to writers from the border regions, they may mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/02/brian-friel\">Brian Friel</a> or Seamus Heaney, but for most people, the border between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">the republic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> is usually regarded as an area whose existence is contentious, where terms are unfavourable and the writing is characteristically unfeminine. It is an area that Labour\u2019s former secretary of state for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees referred to as \u201cbandit country\u201d in 1974, and perceptions have been slow to shift.</p> <p>Yet the region has catalysed some of the country\u2019s finest writing and never more so than today. Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/good-friday-agreement\">Good Friday </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/good-friday-agreement\">agreement</a>, the border region is no longer the insular, provincial place you\u2019ve read about. These days it\u2019s the setting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/19/derry-girls-channel-4-the-funniest-thing-on-tv-lisa-mcgee\">hit TV comedies</a> about teenage friendships, Michael Portillo train documentaries, pioneering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/29/derry-city-of-culture-reawakened-idealism\">city of culture</a> bids, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/borderirish?lang=en\">parody Twitter accounts</a>. Suddenly the border seems the whip-smart, funny and sophisticated breeding ground its inhabitants always knew it was. It\u2019s also become a political centre of attention again, thanks to Brexit, and its writers and artists are no longer willing to relinquish control of its narrative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorderIrish/status/961582201363148801\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s me at the Brexit negotiations. <a href=\"https://t.co/sVuFOahZ3o\">pic.twitter.com/sVuFOahZ3o</a></p>&mdash; The Irish Border (@BorderIrish) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorderIrish/status/961582201363148801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 8, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Of this recent crop of writers, perhaps the best known is poet and editor <a href=\"http://colettebryce.com/biography/\">Colette Bryce</a>. Having grown up amid the often male-dominated, oppressive environment of Troubles-era Derry, Bryce relocated to Scotland in 2002 before transferring to the south of England to become editor of Poetry London. In 2003 she won the National Poetry Competition for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview12\">The Full Indian Rope Trick</a>, a searing meditation on the possibility of escape and self-realisation. The following year, her collection of the same name (Picador, 2005) was shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize.</p> <p>Bryce\u2019s work has been variously described as \u201csatisfying, convincing [and] light-as-a-feather\u201d and \u201cfilled \u2026 with the impulse to get out and away\u201d, but with the publication of <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/whole-rain-domed-universe/\">The Whole and Rain-Domed Universe</a> (Picador, 2014) she made an unflinching return to her Derry roots. In her poem North and South, the border is a \u201cbarely controllable thing / to be wrestled\u201d. In Helicopters, it features as \u201cthe head wound of an animal\u201d attended by \u201ca business of flies\u201d. To Bryce, the border is a living thing; a man-made creature with a pulse and form and riven through with the worst impulses humanity has to offer.</p> <p>\u201cThe fallout from Brexit, with its attendant strains of racism and populism, is going to affect all of our literature,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish that wasn\u2019t the case.</p> <p>\u201cThe ease of travel and reduced visibility has been so important for peace in recent years. The timing is particularly regrettable, given the approaching centenary of partition \u2013 an old wound for many in the north. And we had only just marked, with a kind of quiet relief, 20 years since the Good Friday agreement. It\u2019s hard to believe the complete lack of consideration given to any of this by the Tories when they called their ill-fated referendum.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50909f89a703571259d206068ab68bab88ce356a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50909f89a703571259d206068ab68bab88ce356a/1281_238_3792_2275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hands Across the Divide by sculptor Maurice Harron, in Derry, Northern Ireland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hands Across the Divide by sculptor Maurice Harron, in Derry, Northern Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Novelist and Keady native Michael Hughes echoes many of these sentiments.

It wasn\u2019t until 2018, when the full extent of the Brexit crisis was finally realised, that Hughes turned his attention to the border of his youth.</p> <p>Set after a fictionalised version of the IRA ceasefire in the mid-1990s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/10/country-michael-hughes-review-iliad-troubles\">Country</a> recalibrates The Iliad for a jaded, war-weary generation \u2013 casting the Border Sniper as Achilles, a brutal paramilitary leader named Pig as Agamemnon, and an SAS captain named Henry as Hector. What follows is brutal, detailed and often funny, though what jumps out right away is Hughes\u2019s ear for the harsh, cutting dialect of the south Armagh border region. \u201cThis is a good one,\u201d the Border Sniper often begins his anecdotes. \u201cWait now till you hear.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes says of his decision to write about the border: \u201cNow that it has come to mean less and has moved more into the realm of folk memory, its inhabitants are naturally starting to pay attention to themselves. Scrutiny tells you who you are.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up on the border used to promote an unofficial sense of lawlessness, and I think that \u2013 far from us wanting to eclipse Belfast or Dublin \u2013 we were kind of delighted to be out of the spotlight. Now we\u2019re getting used to the focus being on us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a02c11d9c2a6c5c81b2cf838369b74e9e37b7915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a02c11d9c2a6c5c81b2cf838369b74e9e37b7915/0_197_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cuilcagh mountain boardwalk which threads along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on 22 February, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cuilcagh mountain boardwalk, which threads along the border.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, not all writers from the border are as keen to have the border defined by conflict.

      "bodyText": "Ask anyone where they think about when they think about Irish writing and they\u2019ll probably say Dublin or Belfast. When it comes to writers from the border regions, they may mention Brian Friel or Seamus Heaney, but for most people, the border between the republic and Northern Ireland is usually regarded as an area whose existence is contentious, where terms are unfavourable and the writing is characteristically unfeminine. It is an area that Labour\u2019s former secretary of state for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees referred to as \u201cbandit country\u201d in 1974, and perceptions have been slow to shift. Yet the region has catalysed some of the country\u2019s finest writing and never more so than today. Since the Good Friday agreement, the border region is no longer the insular, provincial place you\u2019ve read about. These days it\u2019s the setting for hit TV comedies about teenage friendships, Michael Portillo train documentaries, pioneering city of culture bids, and parody Twitter accounts. Suddenly the border seems the whip-smart, funny and sophisticated breeding ground its inhabitants always knew it was. It\u2019s also become a political centre of attention again, thanks to Brexit, and its writers and artists are no longer willing to relinquish control of its narrative. Of this recent crop of writers, perhaps the best known is poet and editor Colette Bryce. Having grown up amid the often male-dominated, oppressive environment of Troubles-era Derry, Bryce relocated to Scotland in 2002 before transferring to the south of England to become editor of Poetry London. In 2003 she won the National Poetry Competition for The Full Indian Rope Trick, a searing meditation on the possibility of escape and self-realisation. The following year, her collection of the same name (Picador, 2005) was shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize. Bryce\u2019s work has been variously described as \u201csatisfying, convincing [and] light-as-a-feather\u201d and \u201cfilled \u2026 with the impulse to get out and away\u201d, but with the publication of The Whole and Rain-Domed Universe (Picador, 2014) she made an unflinching return to her Derry roots. In her poem North and South, the border is a \u201cbarely controllable thing / to be wrestled\u201d. In Helicopters, it features as \u201cthe head wound of an animal\u201d attended by \u201ca business of flies\u201d. To Bryce, the border is a living thing; a man-made creature with a pulse and form and riven through with the worst impulses humanity has to offer. \u201cThe fallout from Brexit, with its attendant strains of racism and populism, is going to affect all of our literature,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cThe ease of travel and reduced visibility has been so important for peace in recent years. The timing is particularly regrettable, given the approaching centenary of partition \u2013 an old wound for many in the north. And we had only just marked, with a kind of quiet relief, 20 years since the Good Friday agreement. It\u2019s hard to believe the complete lack of consideration given to any of this by the Tories when they called their ill-fated referendum.\u201d Novelist and Keady native Michael Hughes echoes many of these sentiments. Born during a particularly chaotic period in the Troubles to a respectable south Armagh family, Hughes came late to writing. His first novel, The Countenance Divine, was published in 2016 to rapturous praise, and earned him lofty comparisons with AS Byatt, Hilary Mantel and David Mitchell. It wasn\u2019t until 2018, when the full extent of the Brexit crisis was finally realised, that Hughes turned his attention to the border of his youth. Set after a fictionalised version of the IRA ceasefire in the mid-1990s, Country recalibrates The Iliad for a jaded, war-weary generation \u2013 casting the Border Sniper as Achilles, a brutal paramilitary leader named Pig as Agamemnon, and an SAS captain named Henry as Hector. What follows is brutal, detailed and often funny, though what jumps out right away is Hughes\u2019s ear for the harsh, cutting dialect of the south Armagh border region. \u201cThis is a good one,\u201d the Border Sniper often begins his anecdotes. \u201cWait now till you hear.\u201d Hughes says of his decision to write about the border: \u201cNow that it has come to mean less and has moved more into the realm of folk memory, its inhabitants are naturally starting to pay attention to themselves. Scrutiny tells you who you are. \u201cGrowing up on the border used to promote an unofficial sense of lawlessness, and I think that \u2013 far from us wanting to eclipse Belfast or Dublin \u2013 we were kind of delighted to be out of the spotlight. Now we\u2019re getting used to the focus being on us.\u201d Of course, not all writers from the border are as keen to have the border defined by conflict.

In 2018, her follow-up, Genuine Human Values, was published to further praise and, later this year, her debut novel Tennis Lessons is set to be released by Doubleday. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about borders,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a border, you\u2019re a border \u2026 Growing up in Derry meant growing accustomed to external perceptions of identity which were often reductive and binary, and in my own writing I attempt to write the experience I had, which was one of much greater fluidity than what might be expected.\u201d Similarly, though the work of Donegal writer Annemarie N\u00ed Churre\u00e1in is steeped in the windswept landscape and harsh character of Ireland\u2019s north-west, her borders are more to do with the divided self.

      "body": "<p>I feel a certain sympathy for Richard Eyre. The former director of the National Theatre was asked at a literary festival <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gender-swap-roles-make-shakespeare-miss-a-beat-says-sir-richard-eyre-76xrvbh0f\" title=\"\">about alterations made to the text of Shakespeare\u2019s Timon of Athens</a>, in a recent RSC production that cast the actor Kathryn Hunter in the title role. His response \u2013 that to change \u201cman\u201d to \u201cwoman\u201d, for example, fundamentally changed the rhythm of the play\u2019s iambic pentameter, and should, therefore, be avoided \u2013 was appropriately technical. But, unsurprisingly, reports focused not on what a disruption to iambic pentameter might imply, but on <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2019/richard-eyre-hits-out-at-gender-swapped-shakespeare-productions-for-tampering-with-rhythms-of-text\" title=\"\">Eyre\u2019s more broadly applicable words</a>: \u201cThe plays are there. Do the plays. You can do anything with them. Productions are like drawing on sand, the tide comes in. Do the plays. Don\u2019t rework it.\u201d</p> <p>Hmmm. My benefit-of-the-doubt-o-meter twitches slightly here; not least because if each new production is a line in the sand merely waiting to be washed over, wouldn\u2019t that be a greater inducement to experiment? But primarily because we know that Shakespeare\u2019s works were themselves new versions of old stories, and because we have the evidence of their resilience in front of us \u2013 in the continuing flow of adaptations and staging around the world.</p> <p>But is Eyre correct about the central importance of textual rhythm, and about the dangers of changing it? How do we determine what can be changed and what cannot? Who is the arbiter?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/hilary-mantel-is-wrong-about-shakespeare-young-people-love-it\">Hilary Mantel is wrong about Shakespeare \u2013 young people love it | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In practical terms, nobody. The plays are out of copyright and can be read or performed anywhere, by anybody, in whatever manner they prefer. And outside the scholarly world and the world of the theatre professional, those who can assess how greatly apparently small changes \u2013 in the case of changing man to woman, a single syllable \u2013 affect how those lines land and what they can carry, are a pretty small bunch. The thought of theatregoers emerging into the stilly night and saying to one another, \u201cIf I\u2019d known there was going to be an extra foot in Act III I\u2019d have stayed at home,\u201d is an unlikely one.</p> <p>And yet we all know that language has rhythm and that it has a profound effect on how we speak and how we listen; to reject that idea simply because it comes from the mouth of a ritzy theatre director comes dangerously close to not trusting experts. Eyre may be quite correct to say that the metre of the line is, essentially, its DNA; change the metre and you change the line.</p> <p>That is why Shakespeare\u2019s lines have entered our common language like no other playwright\u2019s before or since; why we understand that the quality of mercy is not strained, why tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow \u201cCreeps in this petty pace from day to day, / To the last syllable of recorded time\u201d. Where Shakespeare departs from his chosen metre is as important as where he sticks to it; and the rhythm is as integral to his empathetic insight into the human psyche as the vocabulary he chooses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d07ef925361ecc1b151c9d5a5bc4ec3114265e42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07ef925361ecc1b151c9d5a5bc4ec3114265e42/0_199_3805_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Terry playing Hamlet alongside Colin Hurley\u2019s Ghost at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Most of us are happy to weigh in on whether we think a hero can become a heroine.\u2019 Michelle Terry as Hamlet and Colin Hurley as Ghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the plays are not simply texts. They are also works of performance, designed to be adapted by individual human voices, by pitch and timbre, by the interplay of spoken words and physical action. Naturally, it becomes more complicated. Most of us are ill-equipped to conduct a detailed argument about prosody, but nearly all of us are happy to weigh in on whether we think a hero can become a heroine; whether a role that has been played for hundreds of years by a white person can be played by a black or Asian actor; whether a piece of casting can change our view of what bodies we associate with certain characters.</p> <p>This time last year, I sat at the Globe watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/11/shakespeares-globe-casts-its-own-artistic-director-as-hamlet\" title=\"\">Michelle Terry</a> take on the role of Hamlet. But it was Shubham Saraf\u2019s appearance as Ophelia that provided the real jolt.

And it underlined what should be an evident truth: that consciously widening a work of art\u2019s capacity is not an act of generosity towards those now included \u2013 female actors, actors of colour, differently bodied actors \u2013 but an act of fidelity towards the work itself.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Clark is a feature writer</p>",

      "bodyText": "I feel a certain sympathy for Richard Eyre. The former director of the National Theatre was asked at a literary festival about alterations made to the text of Shakespeare\u2019s Timon of Athens, in a recent RSC production that cast the actor Kathryn Hunter in the title role. His response \u2013 that to change \u201cman\u201d to \u201cwoman\u201d, for example, fundamentally changed the rhythm of the play\u2019s iambic pentameter, and should, therefore, be avoided \u2013 was appropriately technical. But, unsurprisingly, reports focused not on what a disruption to iambic pentameter might imply, but on Eyre\u2019s more broadly applicable words: \u201cThe plays are there. Do the plays. You can do anything with them. Productions are like drawing on sand, the tide comes in. Do the plays. Don\u2019t rework it.\u201d Hmmm. My benefit-of-the-doubt-o-meter twitches slightly here; not least because if each new production is a line in the sand merely waiting to be washed over, wouldn\u2019t that be a greater inducement to experiment? But primarily because we know that Shakespeare\u2019s works were themselves new versions of old stories, and because we have the evidence of their resilience in front of us \u2013 in the continuing flow of adaptations and staging around the world. But is Eyre correct about the central importance of textual rhythm, and about the dangers of changing it? How do we determine what can be changed and what cannot? Who is the arbiter? In practical terms, nobody. The plays are out of copyright and can be read or performed anywhere, by anybody, in whatever manner they prefer. And outside the scholarly world and the world of the theatre professional, those who can assess how greatly apparently small changes \u2013 in the case of changing man to woman, a single syllable \u2013 affect how those lines land and what they can carry, are a pretty small bunch. The thought of theatregoers emerging into the stilly night and saying to one another, \u201cIf I\u2019d known there was going to be an extra foot in Act III I\u2019d have stayed at home,\u201d is an unlikely one. And yet we all know that language has rhythm and that it has a profound effect on how we speak and how we listen; to reject that idea simply because it comes from the mouth of a ritzy theatre director comes dangerously close to not trusting experts. Eyre may be quite correct to say that the metre of the line is, essentially, its DNA; change the metre and you change the line. That is why Shakespeare\u2019s lines have entered our common language like no other playwright\u2019s before or since; why we understand that the quality of mercy is not strained, why tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow \u201cCreeps in this petty pace from day to day, / To the last syllable of recorded time\u201d. Where Shakespeare departs from his chosen metre is as important as where he sticks to it; and the rhythm is as integral to his empathetic insight into the human psyche as the vocabulary he chooses. But the plays are not simply texts. They are also works of performance, designed to be adapted by individual human voices, by pitch and timbre, by the interplay of spoken words and physical action. Naturally, it becomes more complicated. Most of us are ill-equipped to conduct a detailed argument about prosody, but nearly all of us are happy to weigh in on whether we think a hero can become a heroine; whether a role that has been played for hundreds of years by a white person can be played by a black or Asian actor; whether a piece of casting can change our view of what bodies we associate with certain characters. This time last year, I sat at the Globe watching Michelle Terry take on the role of Hamlet. But it was Shubham Saraf\u2019s appearance as Ophelia that provided the real jolt. A man, an Asian man, playing a young woman who is effectively gaslit to the point of suicide by Hamlet; a character whose default image is surely John Everett Millais\u2019s painting of her floating serenely, white, pale, delicate \u2013 dead \u2013 among the flowers and reeds of the dark river. In that context, it is hard to see Ophelia as anything other than female, almost luminous, terrifyingly delicate. Not dark, nor masculine. That dislocation ended up being one of the most powerful elements of the production, the thing that slowed the mind ranging ahead to the next familiar scene or speech, that brought it back to who Ophelia was time and again. And it underlined what should be an evident truth: that consciously widening a work of art\u2019s capacity is not an act of generosity towards those now included \u2013 female actors, actors of colour, differently bodied actors \u2013 but an act of fidelity towards the work itself. \u2022 Alex Clark is a feature writer",

      "body": "<p>At sunset on a chill March evening beside Notting Hill Methodist church, survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster gathered for a monthly ritual: a silent walk to remember the 72 people killed by a fire that roared up 20 storeys in 25 minutes, belching toxic smoke. As the flames raged through the night of 14 June 2017, families huddled and died together in their homes; some stayed on the phone to loved ones, who heard their final breaths. People scrambled over dead bodies to escape, and at least one person jumped.</p> <p>As the group gathered, 21 months on, the atmosphere was muted and calm, but there was a current of pain as survivors and the bereaved greeted each other. Among them was Ed Daffarn, 56. He had been a punk in the 1980s, had moved into Grenfell in 2001, and beaten addiction to become a mental-health social worker. In the months before the fire, he had been writing a blog voicing the tenants\u2019 frustrations. In one chillingly prescient post, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-42072477\" title=\"\">he had predicted</a> that the landlord\u2019s failure to care for the tenants\u2019 safety or to listen to their needs would end in tragedy.</p> <p>Next came Karim Mussilhy, 33, who was working as an Audi sales manager in Mayfair before the fire. His uncle, Hesham Rahman, had lived on the top floor of Grenfell Tower, and Mussilhy spent frantic days searching for him. After three weeks Hesham was presumed dead, and by the end of August his remains had been identified. Months later, once the building was stabilised, Mussilhy scaled 24 flights of narrow stairs, past sooty handprints of fleeing adults and children, to Hesham\u2019s flat. Inside, the total blackness of the walls and melted light fixtures confirmed to him the terror and helplessness his uncle must have felt. He recited Qur\u2019anic verses, prayed and said sorry, even though it wasn\u2019t his fault.</p> <p>The marchers set off at a prayerful pace, and the only sounds were shoes on tarmac and cars on the nearby Westway flyover. Police made the traffic wait at junctions, creating space for the Grenfell mourners, sod the inconvenience. Drivers waited. No one honked their horn.</p> <p>After about 90 minutes, the procession wound up beneath the Westway in a concrete undercroft covered with murals bearing slogans such as \u201cblessed are they that mourn\u201d and \u201cconvict RBKC [Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea] for corporate massacre\u201d. The tower, shrouded in white plastic, loomed like a totem. The marchers turned towards it for a minute\u2019s silence and the names of the dead were read out by those present. Among them present was Natasha Elcock, a mother of three, who escaped with her partner and six-year-old daughter only when the flames were roaring through her 11th-floor kitchen window.</p> <p>Elcock, a supermarket manager, is now chair of <a href=\"https://www.grenfellunited.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Grenfell United</a> (GU), the main group representing survivors and the bereaved. In the two years since the fire, this group has been shaped by its committee members \u2013 who include Daffarn and Mussihly \u2013 into something remarkable. It was one of dozens of support and campaign groups to emerge in the immediate aftermath of the fire, but has become the most enduring and influential. Its members now include most of the 305 survivors and hundreds more bereaved relatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/10/grenfell-group-attacks-lack-of-progress-before-second-anniversary\">Two years on, Grenfell survivors accuse ministers of 'going through the motions'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While other groups, such as Justice 4 Grenfell, have tended to be more vocally political and have forged relations with trade unions, GU aims to be non-partisan. Its founding mandate called for \u201ca strong, independent, united and dignified voice for the residents\u201d to \u201ckeep the community together, to provide support to one another in rebuilding lives, to seek justice and accountability and to honour the memory of those who died\u201d. But they have been drawn towards bigger goals, including winning greater powers for England\u2019s 9.5m renting households, improving fire safety and ending prejudice against social-housing tenants. All the while, they are wrestling with their own grief and trauma.</p> <p>In a way, they had no choice, because the fire at Grenfell exposed some of the gravest social problems facing Britain today. Deepening divides along race and wealth lines, and the seriousness of the housing crisis, were reflected in the fate of a single neglected council block.</p> <p>Grenfell shattered Britain\u2019s image of itself as a houseproud nation. In Kensington and Chelsea, the country\u2019s richest borough, where billions of pounds in private investment had poured into new luxury housing, a few hundred thousand pounds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/30/grenfell-cladding-was-changed-to-cheaper-version-reports-say\" title=\"\">had been </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/30/grenfell-cladding-was-changed-to-cheaper-version-reports-say\" title=\"\">cut</a> from Grenfell\u2019s refurbishment budget, resulting in the use of cheaper, combustible cladding materials that burned like petrol. It was symptomatic of a national housing crisis in which more than 1 million renters suffer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/overcrowding-social-housing-england\" title=\"\">overcrowding</a>; more than 300,000 homes stand empty and more than 2 million people live in homes so decrepit they are a serious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/28/hundreds-of-thousands-living-in-squalid-rented-homes-in-england\" title=\"\">health hazard</a>. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the fire, it turned out that tens of thousands of other residents in more than 400 residential tower blocks across England were living in flats wrapped in similar materials. Public officials were routinely signing off housing as safe based only on drawings and not site checks. Builders were bodging life-saving safety features, such as leaving out firebreaks in facades. The disaster also exposed an ugly seam of prejudice about residents of social housing.</p> <p>Grenfell United is trying to tackle all this and more. By directing their anger into proposals for reform, a group of marginalised local authority tenants have penetrated a system that previously showed them only institutional indifference. They have reached the Downing Street cabinet room, where they have challenged the prime minister.</p> <p>The group\u2019s commitment to closing the gap between these two distant worlds is not without personal risk. They have yoked their own recovery to achieving solutions to profound social problems. It is a courageous choice, because their own mental health and ability to restart their lives in part depends on success.</p> <p>Now, as the two-year anniversary approaches, everything they have been fighting for hangs in the balance. Serious concerns remain over the effectiveness of the public inquiry into the disaster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/17/grenfell-fire-inquiry-admits-it-will-not-report-until-october\" title=\"\">delayed again</a> last month, while hundreds of other tower blocks remain \u2013 by the government\u2019s own standards \u2013 unsafe.</p> <p>Back under the Westway, Mussilhy addressed the crowd from the stage: \u201cWe fight every day; our own fights, our loved ones\u2019 fights, and we fight for the whole nation. That\u2019s the most important part of all. We will never get our loved ones back, but it is not too late for others. But our voices, yet, seem to be echoing into space. Nothing has changed after all this time, but yet everything has changed, for us at least.\u201d</p> <p>This is the inside story of Grenfell United: a story of survival.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Ed Daffarn loved his 13th-floor flat in Grenfell. Along one wall he stacked hundreds of LPs: reggae, Bowie, the Clash and classical music from his late father\u2019s collection. In the corner he propped his cricket kit-bag. But in recent years he had come to loathe his landlord, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation (KCTMO), which managed the tower for the council. His frustration peaked during the two-year, \u00a310m refurbishment, completed in 2016, during which the tower was wrapped in aluminium composite cladding. Daffarn had felt repeatedly fobbed off by the landlord. Promises to consult residents about works to reclad the tower, in part to improve its appearance to surrounding residents, were broken, and freedom of information requests for project minutes were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/10/grenfell-survivor-says-firefighters-had-to-abandon-rescue-of-disabled-father\" title=\"\">refused</a>. The leadership of Kensington and Chelsea, which owned the tower, took criticism personally and \u201ccouldn\u2019t see that they were public servants performing a public function\u201d but behaved as if they were in a private members\u2019 club, he said.</p> <p>Daffarn and Francis O\u2019Connor, who lived on the neighbouring Lancaster West Estate, poured their efforts into dozens of carefully researched articles on their <a href=\"https://grenfellactiongroup.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Grenfell Action Group blog</a>, which was dedicated to charting indifference and neglect from their landlords. Seven months before the fire, Daffarn wrote: \u201cIt is a truly terrifying thought but \u2026 only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord \u2026 and bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation that they inflict upon their tenants and leaseholders.\u201d It warned that the tenants\u2019 management group\u2019s \u201csordid collusion\u201d with the council is a \u201crecipe for a future major disaster\u201d.</p> <p>Normally about 200 people a month clicked on the blog, but in the hours after the fire, it recorded 3m hits, and Daffarn became known as the \u201cprophet of Grenfell\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it to you,\u201d Daffarn told me. \u201cI\u2019m not a religious person, but that blog wrote itself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"048ff6206f35a4adc6373bd9fe9c88551fb000ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/048ff6206f35a4adc6373bd9fe9c88551fb000ad/0_0_8425_5617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Daffarn, former resident of Grenfell Tower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Daffarn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the disaster he predicted came, on 14 June 2017, Daffarn was listening to late-night BBC London talk radio. He smelled burning, but thought it was just food, until Willie Thompson, a 62-year-old father of two who had lived in Grenfell for 20 years, telephoned him shortly after 1am and yelled at him to get out. When Daffarn opened his front door, billowing smoke filled the corridor. \u201cShit man, this isn\u2019t going to end well for me,\u201d he thought. Out in the hallway, he couldn\u2019t see, and couldn\u2019t breathe. He was convinced he had just three breaths left when a firefighter grabbed his leg, and led him to the fire escape. He ran for his life down the stairs and when he got out and looked up at the inferno. \u201cI was wailing inside my soul,\u201d he told the public inquiry. </p> <p>In the terrible chaos in the early hours of that Wednesday morning, stunned survivors found refuge where they could. Daffarn went to Rugby Portobello, a nearby sports club, one of several community centres that opened their doors in the middle of the night. One of Daffarn\u2019s neighbours, Shahin Sadafi, was also there. He had been in Kent at a business conference, but sped through the night back to London to rescue his mother from \u201ca scene you only see in movies and war zones\u201d. Sadafi found her alive and safe, but was devastated by the chaos. At the time, the official death toll was six, but that did not tally with the 30 or more body bags he had seen with his own eyes that night. Even as the flames died down, there seemed to be no organisation for survivors. He wondered: \u201cAre they trying to cover up the truth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI nearly lost my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI started becoming so enraged. I said to Ed: \u2018We have got to find out what is going on. We have got to bring people together, find our neighbours.\u2019\u201d In the midst of fear and anger, he saw a purpose. It was \u201ca motivating moment\u201d, he said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The sports hall was hot and sweaty, with babies crying, but a handful of Grenfell residents started to gather themselves on that first day, and made lists of names and numbers of survivors who passed through. It became \u201ca piece of sanity\u201d amid the chaos of random donations flooding in, cash being handed out and journalists looking for stories.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very obvious, at that stage, that nobody else was going to do anything for us,\u201d recalled Daffarn.</p> <p>\u201cWe would say: \u2018Right guys, back here tomorrow at 9am. Let\u2019s meet and get some action going,\u2019\u201d Sadafi said.</p> <p>On Thursday 15 June, when the extent of the death toll was becoming clearer, Sadafi and Daffarn tried to call a meeting to order. Some 55 people were in the sports hall where survivors had gathered after a sleepless night.</p> <p>\u201cThe voices and the trauma were so large that we realised we weren\u2019t going to be able to facilitate a group ourselves,\u201d said Daffarn, who by now was feeling a sense of dread and angst at the extent of the abandonment by the authorities and in reaction to the trauma. \u201cWe felt we were having to find out for ourselves who was alive and who was dead,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As the weekend approached, Daffarn was growing concerned that the community was scattering at a time when they needed to pull together. And then a group of pop stars showed up.</p> <p>Marcus Mumford, the frontman of Mumford and Sons, and Adele, the Grammy-winning singer, had been quietly volunteering from the morning of the fire at Clement James church, another response centre. They wanted to do more, and came together with the singer Sam Smith, Will Champion, the drummer from Coldplay, and the rapper Dave to propose a charity concert. Daffarn didn\u2019t recognise Mumford, and by now had missed three night\u2019s sleep. He thought: \u201cYou think a rock star\u2019s going to help this?\u201d</p> <p>Daffarn and Sadafi were becoming aware that the community response to the disaster could easily turn violent. Kensington and Chelsea town hall had been stormed two days after the fire, and a group calling itself Movement for Justice By Any Means Necessary called for \u201ca day of rage\u201d the following week. The pair instinctively felt more violence was the wrong response to the trauma<strong> </strong>their community had just suffered.</p> <p>Plenty of people felt differently. Willie Thompson, who was involved with Daffarn in a residents\u2019 group called The Grenfell Compact, and had alerted his friend to the fire, was also at Rugby Portobello and was asking himself if they shouldn\u2019t have taken a more direct approach before the fire. \u201cEddie and the others, they like to sit down and talk and have meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cI will accept that up to a point, and then I will start kicking doors. I would have been willing to be locked up for the cause.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b98e8eb1f602fef4725141d768bf6ac99419a4d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b98e8eb1f602fef4725141d768bf6ac99419a4d2/612_946_8076_4846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willie Thompson, Grenfell survivor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willie Thompson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the days after the fire, Daffarn and Sadafi realised they badly needed someone to help them set up a group. A local intermediary introduced Oliver McTernan, a softly spoken Irish priest, who had worked for decades in conflict resolution in the Middle East, most recently in Tunisia, Egypt and Gaza, but had also been a parish priest in North Kensington. On 22 June, a week after the fire, McTernan helped call a meeting to try and agree a mandate for Grenfell United.</p> <p>\u201cWe asked the simple question: \u2018What are your needs?\u2019,\u201d recalled McTernan. \u201cI was very struck by what the very first lad said: \u2018Dignity.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>People weren\u2019t screaming for revenge, or demanding money. They talked instead about being strong, independent and unified. McTernan was impressed. The feeling was not that structures needed breaking; instead, the botched refurbishment and the neglectful response to the fire proved that structures needed to be built up.</p> <p>And so the first formal meeting of Grenfell United took place on Saturday 24 June 2017. The minutes read: \u201cResidents are not present as individuals. They must organise and they must establish a structure.\u201d</p> <p>Mumford, who had continued to volunteer, helped secure GU an office and an assistant on the executive floor of his record label\u2019s south Kensington HQ. Rooms lined with gold discs where recording deals with Amy Winehouse and the Rolling Stones had once been signed were provided by David Joseph, the chairman of Universal. It was an unusual place, but it gave them a space to start creating their own institution. Before long they would fill the vacuum left by local government with an action group that worked for them. Downing Street, however, seemed to have other ideas.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Only a week before the disaster, Theresa May had squeaked back into Downing Street after losing the Conservative majority in a snap general election. Already shell-shocked by her own political catastrophe, she didn\u2019t show up at Grenfell until two days after the fire, and when she did, was accused of lacking empathy. As she was driven away in her convoy, escorted by police, local residents called her a coward.</p> <p>Instead of engaging with Grenfell United, the government did something rather strange. Eleven days after the fire, officials introduced some of the GU committee to a local Sudanese community leader, Ibrahim El-Nour, whose aunt, it was understood, had perished in the fire. He had plans for his own representative group, the Grenfell Bereaved and Survivors\u2019 Trust, and had the founding paperwork ready to go.</p> <p>\u201c[The officials] were trying to say it would be easier, instead of having two organisations to talk to, [to] just have one,\u201d Sadafi said. \u201cI remember Oliver saying: \u2018What do you mean, it\u2019s easier for you? It should be easier for the community.\u201d</p> <p>The GU committee declined to sign up, and noted in their minutes the next day that the government officials were trying to \u201ccherry-pick residents\u201d and \u201cshowed complete ineptitude\u201d.</p> <p>One of the officials persisted, emailing El-Nour and Sadafi to complain that they were not forming \u201ca unified and truly representative group\u201d. She told them she would send cars the next day to bring them to meet the leaders of Gold Command, the government\u2019s Grenfell response group, adding: \u201cThis invite is only for you both.\u201d It looked like an attempt to divide and rule. The idea of being whisked off to government offices deepened Sadafi\u2019s suspicions and he refused.</p> <p>The government persisted by calling a public meeting, and leafleted survivors promising that the trust would provide \u201cfull OWNERSHIP of all current and future issues relating to the Victims and Survivors of Grenfell\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1f6fcd19385e1845715921fb75370fd180809eeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f6fcd19385e1845715921fb75370fd180809eeb/0_0_2831_3538/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shahin Sadafi, Chair of Grenfell United\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shahin Sadafi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The meeting was a shambles. Chairs were arranged outside the Westway community centre under the noisy flyover, and before the meeting could even get going, El-Nour was challenged by a group including one of the GU committee members, Mahad Egal, who had lived on the fourth floor. They didn\u2019t believe El-Nour had any connection to the tower. He said his Auntie Fathia had died there. \u201cThey assumed I meant a blood relative,\u201d El-Nour recalled. \u201cThey were saying: \u2018What flat? What floor?\u201d</p> <p>El-Nour explained that Fathia was known as \u201cauntie\u201d as a term of respect, but they were not satisfied, and shouted that he was \u201cspeaking for the police and the government\u201d, and the meeting broke up in acrimony. El-Nour had neither lost a family member, nor was he a survivor. He took no further part in organising Grenfell groups. He said he was well intentioned. A government source said it had wanted to \u201csee if different groups could work together for the benefit of the community\u201d. But the GU committee didn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>\u201cThis was government trying to simplify things for themselves,\u201d said Sadafi. \u201cThat woke us up. We knew people weren\u2019t coming to help us, but that people might be trying to jeopardise us and dismantle what we are doing. I was afraid of the people who should have been helping me.\u201d</p> <p>From that point, Sadafi resolved to pour himself into GU and became its first chairman. He worked 16-hour days, meeting lawyers about inquests and the inquiry, which had been announced but was yet to begin, keeping track of people scattered across the borough in hotels and working out how to co-ordinate volunteers. All the while, he was in deep distress. \u201cI was ready to hurt myself, I was so angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be walking along seeing posters of [missing] kids I saw growing up and I was breaking down.\u201d</p> <p>Ten days after the fire, Sadafi was driving through Kensington when he felt overwhelmed. He froze at a traffic light, as the memories came flooding in. Traffic backed up behind him as he bawled his eyes out.</p> <p>In August 2017, two months after the fire, May agreed to meet in private around 100 survivors at the five-star Royal Garden Hotel near Kensington Palace. GU members seized the chance to tackle her on the issue of class. One told her: \u201cIf this happened on the posher side of the borough, money would not be an issue, emotions would not be an issue and you would totally relate to them.\u201d Another said: \u201cWe are quite dignified and quite civilised people, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with social housing.\u201d</p> <p>Tenants complained about ineffective key workers, offers of new homes on worse tenancy terms, and a hotel that had refused a survivor meals. They demanded that the public inquiry examine the way RBKC treated tenants, and that the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired 72-year-old appeal court judge, appoint a more representative panel to help him look into the culture of social housing.</p> <p>\u201cYou have challenged me tonight,\u201d said May. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fair.\u201d She promised there would be \u00a374m to buy new homes, money for lawyers to represent survivors and\u201cno cover up\u201d at the public inquiry. Less than two months after the government\u2019s failed attempt to back a rival survivors\u2019 group, May also said GU was \u201cone of the good things that has happened\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For all this time, Grenfell United had been operating without any public face. In December 2017, the six-month anniversary, four of its members, Shahin Sadafi, Natasha Elcock, Ahmed Elgwahary and Bellal El Guenuni spoke for the first time in public about their ordeals. The bereaved and survivors were wrestling with an ever-growing list of concerns. Rehousing was going so slowly that 105 households displaced by the disaster were preparing to spend Christmas in hotels. There were fears that the planned public inquiry would fail to grapple with issues such as the neglect of social housing tenants.</p> <p>The venue for GU\u2019s first public appearance was committee room 14 of the House of Commons, a dark and ornately decorated chamber that was packed with senior MPs and ministers. From the dais, Elgwahary spoke. \u201cMy mum and my sister were poisoned by the smoke, they were burned and they were cremated,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to listen to them suffer. I had to listen to them die. I had to watch the flat burn for a couple of days. If that is not torture, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d</p> <p>His simmering anger stunned the room. From that point on, GU took on a more campaigning zeal and moved from coping with trauma and abandonment to finding a public and political voice. Some of the committee gave up work to dedicate themselves to the task, others took leave and everyone worked into the evenings. The youngest member, Tiago Alves, 21, who escaped from the 13th floor, put his physics degree at Kings College London on hold. \u201cI always had respect for authority, but since the fire, that has turned on his head,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They secured direct access to the prime minister, Sajid Javid, then communities secretary, Alok Sharma, the housing minister, and his successors, Dominic Raab and Kit Malthouse. Elcock would rush from her supermarket job to meetings. On one occasion she was running late to meet a cabinet minister because she had to handle a shopper\u2019s complaint about stocks of a particular bottled water. But it was becoming a vocation. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a choice for me,\u201d Mussilhy said. \u201cI have been put in these circumstances where something horrific has happened to me and my family, my neighbours, my friends\u2019 families. It became my life.\u201d</p> <p>GU also decided that the purity of protest is not enough. They have chosen negotiation and relationship-building with politicians embroiled in the very system they believe contributed to the deaths of their neighbours and loved ones. It has not always been easy, but the regular meetings, WhatsApp groups and camaraderie of a joint enterprise has kept them going.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b330b8fe17a8e9086fb297c42a8018b6e6219d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b330b8fe17a8e9086fb297c42a8018b6e6219d4/1055_1108_2203_2755/800.jpg\" alt=\"Karim Mussilhy.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karim Mussilhy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI know it sounds wrong, but from something so horrific, a group of people has come together, doing different things for the same outcome,\u201d Mussilhy said.</p> <p>Ten months on, they felt they were making progress. At a Downing Street meeting with the prime minister in April 2018, they spelled out the need for people with expertise in social housing to preside over the public inquiry alongside Moore-Bick. They demanded that the bereaved and the survivors steer the future plans for a memorial on the site of the tower, and they felt May was coming to understand their seriousness and respect their diligent approach. By now, different parts of the committee had become experts in different issues \u2013 a kind of shadow cabinet. Elcock covered mental health, Elgwahary and Daffarn handled tenants\u2019 rights, while Alves and a couple of others looked at cladding and building regulations. GU had the ear of officials and ministers.</p> <p>But the work was taking a personal toll. By summer 2018, Sadafi was struggling; he had submerged his grief and trauma in GU work and, a year on, needed to stand down to deal with it. Elcock, who had lived in the tower for 20 years, stepped up. She is streetwise and shrewd, and known locally as a strong parent. She has never been any kind of campaigner. \u201cIt has thrust us into a world none of us ever envisaged we would be in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a different outlook on how things have been done.\u201d</p> <p>She has also committed herself to GU for the long run, at least until decisions are made over who, or which organisations, might face criminal charges, possibly for manslaughter or corporate manslaughter \u2013 which is not likely until 2023, after the public inquiry has finished its work.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I have a tea break, I\u2019m checking emails or doing something [for GU],\u201d she said. \u201cIt does become difficult to balance. There are days when it absolutely hits me like a ton of bricks. There are people who died in that building that drive me forward. A 12-year-old girl or a four-year-old. When I feel like I want to give it up, they come back to me.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>With its elected committee and formal standing as a family association, Grenfell United was becoming established. In February 2018, it opened its own headquarters on the sixth floor of an office block tucked behind Kensington High Street. GU Space has since become a place for survivors and those bereaved to receive counselling, health support, and to simply be together. A couple of times a week, there is a homework club for the dozens of school-age survivors, many of whom suffer PTSD.</p> <p>It is calm and welcoming, with mustard and grey sofas, an orchid on the kitchen window sill and shelves of children\u2019s books. Among them is The Knight and the Princess, about a boy and a girl who fall in love and live happily in a \u201cbeautiful, warm and cosy\u201d flat until an \u201cevil dragon, envious of their happiness, kidnaps them and takes them away\u201d. It is about Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi, young Italian architects who died in the fire. Most Friday afternoons, a science teacher called Archie with pink hair and orange dungarees entertains children with fun experiments.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relaxed, open space to engage with other children, and for us to catch up with other bereaved peiople and survivors, and to see if we can assist each other, if we want to share,\u201d said Hisam Choucair as he waited while his children, eight-year-old Zahraa and six-year-old Muhammed, were entertained one Friday in May.</p> <p>The fire killed Hisam\u2019s mother, sister, brother-in-law and three young nieces, Mierna, Fatima, and Zaynab. He has described what happened as \u201can atrocity\u201d caused by the segregation of rich and poor. He is one of the large majority of Grenfell survivors who are members of GU, and it helps him cope.</p> <p>Anne-Marie Murphy, whose brother Denis Murphy died in the fire, is among hundreds more bereaved members. \u201cIt has brought us together,\u201d she said. \u201cThe committee has shown incredible strength and determination in representing us all in the fight for change, especially when some of us haven\u2019t been mentally or physically strong enough.\u201d</p> <p>The committee helps members with housing problems and money, communicates with them through WhatsApp, and liaises with the NHS and the council. But what drives the leadership of GU is achieving political change. They want the legacy of their loss to be that a similar atrocity never happens again.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The one-year anniversary in June 2018 was marked with a vigil at the base of the tower. The bereaved laid white roses, and a cleric from a local mosque sang Qur\u2019anic verses in a haunting, pure voice that echoed around the shrouded tower block. In the following months, frustrations with the official response started to grow. At the public inquiry in September, the London fire commissioner, Dany Cotton, shocked survivors by saying she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/27/london-fire-brigade-chief-denies-she-should-have-expected-grenfell-dany-cotton\" title=\"\">stood by</a> the decision to tell people to stay in their flats well after the fire had raged out of control. Robert Black, the chief executive of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/15/grenfell-tower-management-company-chief-sent-warning-memo-during-fire\" title=\"\">admitted</a> the emergency plan for the building was 15 years out of date. And across England, hundreds of tower blocks remained wrapped in combustible cladding, leading Daffarn to warn the media: \u201cGrenfell Two is in the post.\u201d</p> <p>Survivors still faced problems with their new homes. Many were still in hotels. In government, Javid had been replaced by James Brokenshire as the cabinet member in charge of Grenfell, and GU were getting to know their third housing minister since the fire. The public inquiry was grinding along slowly. The first phase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/13/grenfell-tower-inquiry-what-weve-learned-so-far\" title=\"\">concluded</a> in December. Its report on what happened on the night of the fire, expected to contain recommendations for changes that could protect tens of thousands of other high-rise residents, was due in spring, but never came.</p> <p>On the evening of 19 March 2019, Karim Mussihly walked out of the boardroom at GU Space and screamed in frustration. He had been in there since 11am, and would not finally leave until 9.30pm. The committee was struggling to get answers out of Mark Fisher, director general of the Grenfell public inquiry, about the next steps. The lack of answers was baffling. After all, who was the inquiry for?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e7923245a42ee97107011d3d21177fd629381ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e7923245a42ee97107011d3d21177fd629381ef/0_83_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Moore-Bick, chair of the Grenfell Tower inquiry (left), and Mark Fisher, its director general.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Moore-Bick, chair of the Grenfell Tower inquiry (left), and Mark Fisher, its director general.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Fisher was shown out, the meeting rolled through a crowded landscape of other concerns: people sleeping in buildings with dangerous cladding; poor handling of traumatised Grenfell children by schools; a foul-up by officials planning a permanent memorial on the site of the building; and the detailed work of utility bills and welfare payments for the bereaved and survivors.</p> <p>Elcock rubbed her face with fatigue and frustration. \u201c[We] need to book Brokenshire in a month from now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Brokenshire, a somewhat bland former corporate lawyer, was now key to achieving the change GU wanted to see. But progress seemed to be slowing. Brexit was too often blamed. The mood was hardening. Ministers and officials were \u201ctaking our kindness for weakness\u201d, Mussihly said.</p> <p>Six weeks later, the meeting with Brokenshire was finally fixed. The GU team arrived at the Palace of Westminster and found a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down\" title=\"\">crumbling</a> democratic institution. A protester screamed \u201cStop Brexit\u201d through the railings, a mouse darted across the stone floor of the parliament cafe and water stains ran down the walls leading to committee room 18, where Brokenshire waited. After polite greetings, the meeting settled into a pattern \u2013 the bereaved and survivors took turns to tear strips off the secretary of state for the lack of progress, while Brokenshire\u2019s responses filled time but gave little away.</p> <p>Finally, it got too much to bear. Elcock told him that, since the GU team are not professionals, they have to beg, borrow and steal time from family and work to come to these meetings. The lack of progress \u201cis beyond frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is incompetence or it is indifference.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Ed Daffarn was battling with Grenfell Tower\u2019s council landlords before the fire, he had been frustrated by their failure to take effective action, or to listen to tenants\u2019 fears. Two years down the line, the ministers in charge of finding housing for survivors and steering the inquiry seemed to be showing the same incompetence. In May, Brokenshire finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/09/government-allocates-funds-to-replace-grenfell-style-cladding\" title=\"\">allocated</a> \u00a3200m to fix dangerous cladding on private towers, having already allocated \u00a3400m to social housing.</p> <p>But tens of thousands of leaseholders and tenants were still living in properties covered in combustible cladding. The inquiry\u2019s first-phase report, detailing what happened on the night of the fire, was delayed until October 2019, and the second phase of the inquiry, examining the refurbishment, will not start until 2020. Social-housing reforms remain in draft form. As momentum has stalled, the emotional toll on the GU members has risen.</p> <p>\u201cI go to my counselling and say I can handle it if we get the change,\u201d Daffarn said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the change, I don\u2019t know what I am going to do. I feel like I\u2019ll need to leave the country. This is deeply personal for every one of us. From the minute I wake up until I go to bed at night, I pretty much don\u2019t think of anything else apart from trying to get that change.\u201d</p> <p>The GU committee has been propelled to the frontline of battles against social inequality and racial prejudice. Mussihly, who has not been able to find work since becoming a public face of GU, has received nasty abuse on Facebook. One post, alluding to his white wife, read: \u201cTake your muzzy-loving wife and get out of the country. Your families deserved to die in falafel tower.\u201d</p> <p>They also had to watch as a group of bonfire party revellers in south-east London shared a video of a burning effigy of Grenfell Tower with cardboard cut-out residents at the windows. A man has pleaded not guilty to sharing a grossly offensive video and goes on trial next month.</p> <p>A more subtle gulf also persists between the Grenfell families and those in power. Elcock, for one, clearly finds Nick Hurd, the minister for Grenfell survivors, irritating. Hurd, the son of the former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and educated at Eton and Oxford, has a patrician bearing. On a visit to parliament in April to meet ministers, Elcock sarcastically asked one of his officials: \u201cWhere\u2019s Lord Hurd today? Doing some work, is he? That\u2019s nice of him.\u201d</p> <p>When the GU delegation met Hurd later, he was with Kit Malthouse, the housing minister. They had come from the Commons debate about who should pay to fix hundreds of private towers fitted with combustible, Grenfell-style cladding. The government had avoided answering, but the ministers now seemed to be trying to adopt a pally posture with GU: feet spread and hands in pockets like golfers at the 19th hole.</p> <p>\u201cIf something else happens tonight, who is going to be responsible for that?\u201d asked Mussihly.</p> <p>As the ministers shuffled and looked down at their shoes, there was an echo of the pre-fire gulf between RBKC and its tenants: white, middle-aged, public school-educated Conservatives stonewalling the concerns of working-class men and women with heritage from Morocco to Colombia. When it was time to go, Hurd offered handshakes with his face arranged in an expression of sympathy, but Elcock pulled him towards her and refused to let go.</p> <p>\u201cI am still waiting for your email from three weeks ago,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIn an ideal world, I would have one by close of play tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Hurd nodded, looking chastened.</p> <p>Outside the gates of Parliament, frustration spilled over. Elgwahary said: \u201cOur families were burned and you have to remind them we are not a normal group. You have to do that to sensitise them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2018/may/14/lives-of-grenfell-tower-victims-fire\">The lives of Grenfell Tower: the 72 victims of the fire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Coming up to the two-year anniversary, Daffarn is now among those considering a change in strategy. He reckons he has had more than 30 meetings with ministers and civil servants, and knows not enough has been achieved. This spring, he received back a few possessions from his beloved flat: a diary, part of a coffee set his mother left him, and a fridge magnet \u201ccompletely burned to shit\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to make something good come out of something bad, and what is so terrifying about this is I am beginning to doubt whether that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an empathy gap, but they also have this problem that they are indifferent and incompetent. We had every right to shout at people and be upset. We haven\u2019t done any of that. We have gone in and negotiated. We have worked. We have been grown-up about it.\u201d</p> <p>He said they are considering a different posture. Such was the violence they suffered during the fire, the idea that more violence could help is anathema: GU has been committed to a peaceful, constructive and pragmatic approach. But, in frustration, perhaps, Daffarn now says: \u201cThe one thing they fear is social unrest \u2013 and rightly so. Go to any meeting in Kensington and that anger is still there. It hasn\u2019t dissipated. We wasted 22 months trying to do it this way, and now we have to come up with another solution. We have learned a lot.

      "bodyText": "At sunset on a chill March evening beside Notting Hill Methodist church, survivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster gathered for a monthly ritual: a silent walk to remember the 72 people killed by a fire that roared up 20 storeys in 25 minutes, belching toxic smoke. As the flames raged through the night of 14 June 2017, families huddled and died together in their homes; some stayed on the phone to loved ones, who heard their final breaths. People scrambled over dead bodies to escape, and at least one person jumped. As the group gathered, 21 months on, the atmosphere was muted and calm, but there was a current of pain as survivors and the bereaved greeted each other. Among them was Ed Daffarn, 56. He had been a punk in the 1980s, had moved into Grenfell in 2001, and beaten addiction to become a mental-health social worker. In the months before the fire, he had been writing a blog voicing the tenants\u2019 frustrations. In one chillingly prescient post, he had predicted that the landlord\u2019s failure to care for the tenants\u2019 safety or to listen to their needs would end in tragedy. Next came Karim Mussilhy, 33, who was working as an Audi sales manager in Mayfair before the fire. His uncle, Hesham Rahman, had lived on the top floor of Grenfell Tower, and Mussilhy spent frantic days searching for him. After three weeks Hesham was presumed dead, and by the end of August his remains had been identified. Months later, once the building was stabilised, Mussilhy scaled 24 flights of narrow stairs, past sooty handprints of fleeing adults and children, to Hesham\u2019s flat. Inside, the total blackness of the walls and melted light fixtures confirmed to him the terror and helplessness his uncle must have felt. He recited Qur\u2019anic verses, prayed and said sorry, even though it wasn\u2019t his fault. The marchers set off at a prayerful pace, and the only sounds were shoes on tarmac and cars on the nearby Westway flyover. Police made the traffic wait at junctions, creating space for the Grenfell mourners, sod the inconvenience. Drivers waited. No one honked their horn. After about 90 minutes, the procession wound up beneath the Westway in a concrete undercroft covered with murals bearing slogans such as \u201cblessed are they that mourn\u201d and \u201cconvict RBKC [Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea] for corporate massacre\u201d. The tower, shrouded in white plastic, loomed like a totem. The marchers turned towards it for a minute\u2019s silence and the names of the dead were read out by those present. Among them present was Natasha Elcock, a mother of three, who escaped with her partner and six-year-old daughter only when the flames were roaring through her 11th-floor kitchen window. Elcock, a supermarket manager, is now chair of Grenfell United (GU), the main group representing survivors and the bereaved. In the two years since the fire, this group has been shaped by its committee members \u2013 who include Daffarn and Mussihly \u2013 into something remarkable. It was one of dozens of support and campaign groups to emerge in the immediate aftermath of the fire, but has become the most enduring and influential. Its members now include most of the 305 survivors and hundreds more bereaved relatives. While other groups, such as Justice 4 Grenfell, have tended to be more vocally political and have forged relations with trade unions, GU aims to be non-partisan. Its founding mandate called for \u201ca strong, independent, united and dignified voice for the residents\u201d to \u201ckeep the community together, to provide support to one another in rebuilding lives, to seek justice and accountability and to honour the memory of those who died\u201d. But they have been drawn towards bigger goals, including winning greater powers for England\u2019s 9.5m renting households, improving fire safety and ending prejudice against social-housing tenants. All the while, they are wrestling with their own grief and trauma. In a way, they had no choice, because the fire at Grenfell exposed some of the gravest social problems facing Britain today. Deepening divides along race and wealth lines, and the seriousness of the housing crisis, were reflected in the fate of a single neglected council block. Grenfell shattered Britain\u2019s image of itself as a houseproud nation. In Kensington and Chelsea, the country\u2019s richest borough, where billions of pounds in private investment had poured into new luxury housing, a few hundred thousand pounds had been cut from Grenfell\u2019s refurbishment budget, resulting in the use of cheaper, combustible cladding materials that burned like petrol. It was symptomatic of a national housing crisis in which more than 1 million renters suffer overcrowding; more than 300,000 homes stand empty and more than 2 million people live in homes so decrepit they are a serious health hazard. In the aftermath of the fire, it turned out that tens of thousands of other residents in more than 400 residential tower blocks across England were living in flats wrapped in similar materials. Public officials were routinely signing off housing as safe based only on drawings and not site checks. Builders were bodging life-saving safety features, such as leaving out firebreaks in facades. The disaster also exposed an ugly seam of prejudice about residents of social housing. Grenfell United is trying to tackle all this and more. By directing their anger into proposals for reform, a group of marginalised local authority tenants have penetrated a system that previously showed them only institutional indifference. They have reached the Downing Street cabinet room, where they have challenged the prime minister. The group\u2019s commitment to closing the gap between these two distant worlds is not without personal risk. They have yoked their own recovery to achieving solutions to profound social problems. It is a courageous choice, because their own mental health and ability to restart their lives in part depends on success. Now, as the two-year anniversary approaches, everything they have been fighting for hangs in the balance. Serious concerns remain over the effectiveness of the public inquiry into the disaster, delayed again last month, while hundreds of other tower blocks remain \u2013 by the government\u2019s own standards \u2013 unsafe. Back under the Westway, Mussilhy addressed the crowd from the stage: \u201cWe fight every day; our own fights, our loved ones\u2019 fights, and we fight for the whole nation. That\u2019s the most important part of all. We will never get our loved ones back, but it is not too late for others. But our voices, yet, seem to be echoing into space. Nothing has changed after all this time, but yet everything has changed, for us at least.\u201d This is the inside story of Grenfell United: a story of survival. * * * Ed Daffarn loved his 13th-floor flat in Grenfell. Along one wall he stacked hundreds of LPs: reggae, Bowie, the Clash and classical music from his late father\u2019s collection. In the corner he propped his cricket kit-bag. But in recent years he had come to loathe his landlord, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation (KCTMO), which managed the tower for the council. His frustration peaked during the two-year, \u00a310m refurbishment, completed in 2016, during which the tower was wrapped in aluminium composite cladding. Daffarn had felt repeatedly fobbed off by the landlord. Promises to consult residents about works to reclad the tower, in part to improve its appearance to surrounding residents, were broken, and freedom of information requests for project minutes were refused. The leadership of Kensington and Chelsea, which owned the tower, took criticism personally and \u201ccouldn\u2019t see that they were public servants performing a public function\u201d but behaved as if they were in a private members\u2019 club, he said. Daffarn and Francis O\u2019Connor, who lived on the neighbouring Lancaster West Estate, poured their efforts into dozens of carefully researched articles on their Grenfell Action Group blog, which was dedicated to charting indifference and neglect from their landlords. Seven months before the fire, Daffarn wrote: \u201cIt is a truly terrifying thought but \u2026 only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord \u2026 and bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation that they inflict upon their tenants and leaseholders.\u201d It warned that the tenants\u2019 management group\u2019s \u201csordid collusion\u201d with the council is a \u201crecipe for a future major disaster\u201d. Normally about 200 people a month clicked on the blog, but in the hours after the fire, it recorded 3m hits, and Daffarn became known as the \u201cprophet of Grenfell\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it to you,\u201d Daffarn told me. \u201cI\u2019m not a religious person, but that blog wrote itself.\u201d When the disaster he predicted came, on 14 June 2017, Daffarn was listening to late-night BBC London talk radio. He smelled burning, but thought it was just food, until Willie Thompson, a 62-year-old father of two who had lived in Grenfell for 20 years, telephoned him shortly after 1am and yelled at him to get out. When Daffarn opened his front door, billowing smoke filled the corridor. \u201cShit man, this isn\u2019t going to end well for me,\u201d he thought. Out in the hallway, he couldn\u2019t see, and couldn\u2019t breathe. He was convinced he had just three breaths left when a firefighter grabbed his leg, and led him to the fire escape. He ran for his life down the stairs and when he got out and looked up at the inferno. \u201cI was wailing inside my soul,\u201d he told the public inquiry. In the terrible chaos in the early hours of that Wednesday morning, stunned survivors found refuge where they could. Daffarn went to Rugby Portobello, a nearby sports club, one of several community centres that opened their doors in the middle of the night. One of Daffarn\u2019s neighbours, Shahin Sadafi, was also there. He had been in Kent at a business conference, but sped through the night back to London to rescue his mother from \u201ca scene you only see in movies and war zones\u201d. Sadafi found her alive and safe, but was devastated by the chaos. At the time, the official death toll was six, but that did not tally with the 30 or more body bags he had seen with his own eyes that night. Even as the flames died down, there seemed to be no organisation for survivors. He wondered: \u201cAre they trying to cover up the truth?\u201d \u201cI nearly lost my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI started becoming so enraged. I said to Ed: \u2018We have got to find out what is going on. We have got to bring people together, find our neighbours.\u2019\u201d In the midst of fear and anger, he saw a purpose. It was \u201ca motivating moment\u201d, he said. * * * The sports hall was hot and sweaty, with babies crying, but a handful of Grenfell residents started to gather themselves on that first day, and made lists of names and numbers of survivors who passed through. It became \u201ca piece of sanity\u201d amid the chaos of random donations flooding in, cash being handed out and journalists looking for stories. \u201cIt was very obvious, at that stage, that nobody else was going to do anything for us,\u201d recalled Daffarn. \u201cWe would say: \u2018Right guys, back here tomorrow at 9am. Let\u2019s meet and get some action going,\u2019\u201d Sadafi said. On Thursday 15 June, when the extent of the death toll was becoming clearer, Sadafi and Daffarn tried to call a meeting to order. Some 55 people were in the sports hall where survivors had gathered after a sleepless night. \u201cThe voices and the trauma were so large that we realised we weren\u2019t going to be able to facilitate a group ourselves,\u201d said Daffarn, who by now was feeling a sense of dread and angst at the extent of the abandonment by the authorities and in reaction to the trauma. \u201cWe felt we were having to find out for ourselves who was alive and who was dead,\u201d he said. As the weekend approached, Daffarn was growing concerned that the community was scattering at a time when they needed to pull together. And then a group of pop stars showed up. Marcus Mumford, the frontman of Mumford and Sons, and Adele, the Grammy-winning singer, had been quietly volunteering from the morning of the fire at Clement James church, another response centre. They wanted to do more, and came together with the singer Sam Smith, Will Champion, the drummer from Coldplay, and the rapper Dave to propose a charity concert. Daffarn didn\u2019t recognise Mumford, and by now had missed three night\u2019s sleep. He thought: \u201cYou think a rock star\u2019s going to help this?\u201d Daffarn and Sadafi were becoming aware that the community response to the disaster could easily turn violent. Kensington and Chelsea town hall had been stormed two days after the fire, and a group calling itself Movement for Justice By Any Means Necessary called for \u201ca day of rage\u201d the following week. The pair instinctively felt more violence was the wrong response to the trauma their community had just suffered. Plenty of people felt differently. Willie Thompson, who was involved with Daffarn in a residents\u2019 group called The Grenfell Compact, and had alerted his friend to the fire, was also at Rugby Portobello and was asking himself if they shouldn\u2019t have taken a more direct approach before the fire. \u201cEddie and the others, they like to sit down and talk and have meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cI will accept that up to a point, and then I will start kicking doors. I would have been willing to be locked up for the cause.\u201d In the days after the fire, Daffarn and Sadafi realised they badly needed someone to help them set up a group. A local intermediary introduced Oliver McTernan, a softly spoken Irish priest, who had worked for decades in conflict resolution in the Middle East, most recently in Tunisia, Egypt and Gaza, but had also been a parish priest in North Kensington. On 22 June, a week after the fire, McTernan helped call a meeting to try and agree a mandate for Grenfell United. \u201cWe asked the simple question: \u2018What are your needs?\u2019,\u201d recalled McTernan. \u201cI was very struck by what the very first lad said: \u2018Dignity.\u2019\u201d People weren\u2019t screaming for revenge, or demanding money. They talked instead about being strong, independent and unified. McTernan was impressed. The feeling was not that structures needed breaking; instead, the botched refurbishment and the neglectful response to the fire proved that structures needed to be built up. And so the first formal meeting of Grenfell United took place on Saturday 24 June 2017. The minutes read: \u201cResidents are not present as individuals. They must organise and they must establish a structure.\u201d Mumford, who had continued to volunteer, helped secure GU an office and an assistant on the executive floor of his record label\u2019s south Kensington HQ. Rooms lined with gold discs where recording deals with Amy Winehouse and the Rolling Stones had once been signed were provided by David Joseph, the chairman of Universal. It was an unusual place, but it gave them a space to start creating their own institution. Before long they would fill the vacuum left by local government with an action group that worked for them. Downing Street, however, seemed to have other ideas. * * * Only a week before the disaster, Theresa May had squeaked back into Downing Street after losing the Conservative majority in a snap general election. Already shell-shocked by her own political catastrophe, she didn\u2019t show up at Grenfell until two days after the fire, and when she did, was accused of lacking empathy. As she was driven away in her convoy, escorted by police, local residents called her a coward. Instead of engaging with Grenfell United, the government did something rather strange. Eleven days after the fire, officials introduced some of the GU committee to a local Sudanese community leader, Ibrahim El-Nour, whose aunt, it was understood, had perished in the fire. He had plans for his own representative group, the Grenfell Bereaved and Survivors\u2019 Trust, and had the founding paperwork ready to go. \u201c[The officials] were trying to say it would be easier, instead of having two organisations to talk to, [to] just have one,\u201d Sadafi said. \u201cI remember Oliver saying: \u2018What do you mean, it\u2019s easier for you? It should be easier for the community.\u201d The GU committee declined to sign up, and noted in their minutes the next day that the government officials were trying to \u201ccherry-pick residents\u201d and \u201cshowed complete ineptitude\u201d. One of the officials persisted, emailing El-Nour and Sadafi to complain that they were not forming \u201ca unified and truly representative group\u201d. She told them she would send cars the next day to bring them to meet the leaders of Gold Command, the government\u2019s Grenfell response group, adding: \u201cThis invite is only for you both.\u201d It looked like an attempt to divide and rule. The idea of being whisked off to government offices deepened Sadafi\u2019s suspicions and he refused. The government persisted by calling a public meeting, and leafleted survivors promising that the trust would provide \u201cfull OWNERSHIP of all current and future issues relating to the Victims and Survivors of Grenfell\u201d. The meeting was a shambles. Chairs were arranged outside the Westway community centre under the noisy flyover, and before the meeting could even get going, El-Nour was challenged by a group including one of the GU committee members, Mahad Egal, who had lived on the fourth floor. They didn\u2019t believe El-Nour had any connection to the tower. He said his Auntie Fathia had died there. \u201cThey assumed I meant a blood relative,\u201d El-Nour recalled. \u201cThey were saying: \u2018What flat? What floor?\u201d El-Nour explained that Fathia was known as \u201cauntie\u201d as a term of respect, but they were not satisfied, and shouted that he was \u201cspeaking for the police and the government\u201d, and the meeting broke up in acrimony. El-Nour had neither lost a family member, nor was he a survivor. He took no further part in organising Grenfell groups. He said he was well intentioned. A government source said it had wanted to \u201csee if different groups could work together for the benefit of the community\u201d. But the GU committee didn\u2019t like it. \u201cThis was government trying to simplify things for themselves,\u201d said Sadafi. \u201cThat woke us up. We knew people weren\u2019t coming to help us, but that people might be trying to jeopardise us and dismantle what we are doing. I was afraid of the people who should have been helping me.\u201d From that point, Sadafi resolved to pour himself into GU and became its first chairman. He worked 16-hour days, meeting lawyers about inquests and the inquiry, which had been announced but was yet to begin, keeping track of people scattered across the borough in hotels and working out how to co-ordinate volunteers. All the while, he was in deep distress. \u201cI was ready to hurt myself, I was so angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be walking along seeing posters of [missing] kids I saw growing up and I was breaking down.\u201d Ten days after the fire, Sadafi was driving through Kensington when he felt overwhelmed. He froze at a traffic light, as the memories came flooding in. Traffic backed up behind him as he bawled his eyes out. In August 2017, two months after the fire, May agreed to meet in private around 100 survivors at the five-star Royal Garden Hotel near Kensington Palace. GU members seized the chance to tackle her on the issue of class. One told her: \u201cIf this happened on the posher side of the borough, money would not be an issue, emotions would not be an issue and you would totally relate to them.\u201d Another said: \u201cWe are quite dignified and quite civilised people, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with social housing.\u201d Tenants complained about ineffective key workers, offers of new homes on worse tenancy terms, and a hotel that had refused a survivor meals. They demanded that the public inquiry examine the way RBKC treated tenants, and that the inquiry chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired 72-year-old appeal court judge, appoint a more representative panel to help him look into the culture of social housing. \u201cYou have challenged me tonight,\u201d said May. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fair.\u201d She promised there would be \u00a374m to buy new homes, money for lawyers to represent survivors and\u201cno cover up\u201d at the public inquiry. Less than two months after the government\u2019s failed attempt to back a rival survivors\u2019 group, May also said GU was \u201cone of the good things that has happened\u201d. * * * For all this time, Grenfell United had been operating without any public face. In December 2017, the six-month anniversary, four of its members, Shahin Sadafi, Natasha Elcock, Ahmed Elgwahary and Bellal El Guenuni spoke for the first time in public about their ordeals. The bereaved and survivors were wrestling with an ever-growing list of concerns. Rehousing was going so slowly that 105 households displaced by the disaster were preparing to spend Christmas in hotels. There were fears that the planned public inquiry would fail to grapple with issues such as the neglect of social housing tenants. The venue for GU\u2019s first public appearance was committee room 14 of the House of Commons, a dark and ornately decorated chamber that was packed with senior MPs and ministers. From the dais, Elgwahary spoke. \u201cMy mum and my sister were poisoned by the smoke, they were burned and they were cremated,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to listen to them suffer. I had to listen to them die. I had to watch the flat burn for a couple of days. If that is not torture, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d His simmering anger stunned the room. From that point on, GU took on a more campaigning zeal and moved from coping with trauma and abandonment to finding a public and political voice. Some of the committee gave up work to dedicate themselves to the task, others took leave and everyone worked into the evenings. The youngest member, Tiago Alves, 21, who escaped from the 13th floor, put his physics degree at Kings College London on hold. \u201cI always had respect for authority, but since the fire, that has turned on his head,\u201d he said. They secured direct access to the prime minister, Sajid Javid, then communities secretary, Alok Sharma, the housing minister, and his successors, Dominic Raab and Kit Malthouse. Elcock would rush from her supermarket job to meetings. On one occasion she was running late to meet a cabinet minister because she had to handle a shopper\u2019s complaint about stocks of a particular bottled water. But it was becoming a vocation. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a choice for me,\u201d Mussilhy said. \u201cI have been put in these circumstances where something horrific has happened to me and my family, my neighbours, my friends\u2019 families. It became my life.\u201d GU also decided that the purity of protest is not enough. They have chosen negotiation and relationship-building with politicians embroiled in the very system they believe contributed to the deaths of their neighbours and loved ones. It has not always been easy, but the regular meetings, WhatsApp groups and camaraderie of a joint enterprise has kept them going. \u201cI know it sounds wrong, but from something so horrific, a group of people has come together, doing different things for the same outcome,\u201d Mussilhy said. Ten months on, they felt they were making progress. At a Downing Street meeting with the prime minister in April 2018, they spelled out the need for people with expertise in social housing to preside over the public inquiry alongside Moore-Bick. They demanded that the bereaved and the survivors steer the future plans for a memorial on the site of the tower, and they felt May was coming to understand their seriousness and respect their diligent approach. By now, different parts of the committee had become experts in different issues \u2013 a kind of shadow cabinet. Elcock covered mental health, Elgwahary and Daffarn handled tenants\u2019 rights, while Alves and a couple of others looked at cladding and building regulations. GU had the ear of officials and ministers. But the work was taking a personal toll. By summer 2018, Sadafi was struggling; he had submerged his grief and trauma in GU work and, a year on, needed to stand down to deal with it. Elcock, who had lived in the tower for 20 years, stepped up. She is streetwise and shrewd, and known locally as a strong parent. She has never been any kind of campaigner. \u201cIt has thrust us into a world none of us ever envisaged we would be in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a different outlook on how things have been done.\u201d She has also committed herself to GU for the long run, at least until decisions are made over who, or which organisations, might face criminal charges, possibly for manslaughter or corporate manslaughter \u2013 which is not likely until 2023, after the public inquiry has finished its work. \u201cEvery time I have a tea break, I\u2019m checking emails or doing something [for GU],\u201d she said. \u201cIt does become difficult to balance. There are days when it absolutely hits me like a ton of bricks. There are people who died in that building that drive me forward. A 12-year-old girl or a four-year-old. When I feel like I want to give it up, they come back to me.\u201d * * * With its elected committee and formal standing as a family association, Grenfell United was becoming established. In February 2018, it opened its own headquarters on the sixth floor of an office block tucked behind Kensington High Street. GU Space has since become a place for survivors and those bereaved to receive counselling, health support, and to simply be together. A couple of times a week, there is a homework club for the dozens of school-age survivors, many of whom suffer PTSD. It is calm and welcoming, with mustard and grey sofas, an orchid on the kitchen window sill and shelves of children\u2019s books. Among them is The Knight and the Princess, about a boy and a girl who fall in love and live happily in a \u201cbeautiful, warm and cosy\u201d flat until an \u201cevil dragon, envious of their happiness, kidnaps them and takes them away\u201d. It is about Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi, young Italian architects who died in the fire. Most Friday afternoons, a science teacher called Archie with pink hair and orange dungarees entertains children with fun experiments. \u201cIt\u2019s a relaxed, open space to engage with other children, and for us to catch up with other bereaved peiople and survivors, and to see if we can assist each other, if we want to share,\u201d said Hisam Choucair as he waited while his children, eight-year-old Zahraa and six-year-old Muhammed, were entertained one Friday in May. The fire killed Hisam\u2019s mother, sister, brother-in-law and three young nieces, Mierna, Fatima, and Zaynab. He has described what happened as \u201can atrocity\u201d caused by the segregation of rich and poor. He is one of the large majority of Grenfell survivors who are members of GU, and it helps him cope. Anne-Marie Murphy, whose brother Denis Murphy died in the fire, is among hundreds more bereaved members. \u201cIt has brought us together,\u201d she said. \u201cThe committee has shown incredible strength and determination in representing us all in the fight for change, especially when some of us haven\u2019t been mentally or physically strong enough.\u201d The committee helps members with housing problems and money, communicates with them through WhatsApp, and liaises with the NHS and the council. But what drives the leadership of GU is achieving political change. They want the legacy of their loss to be that a similar atrocity never happens again. * * * The one-year anniversary in June 2018 was marked with a vigil at the base of the tower. The bereaved laid white roses, and a cleric from a local mosque sang Qur\u2019anic verses in a haunting, pure voice that echoed around the shrouded tower block. In the following months, frustrations with the official response started to grow. At the public inquiry in September, the London fire commissioner, Dany Cotton, shocked survivors by saying she stood by the decision to tell people to stay in their flats well after the fire had raged out of control. Robert Black, the chief executive of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, admitted the emergency plan for the building was 15 years out of date. And across England, hundreds of tower blocks remained wrapped in combustible cladding, leading Daffarn to warn the media: \u201cGrenfell Two is in the post.\u201d Survivors still faced problems with their new homes. Many were still in hotels. In government, Javid had been replaced by James Brokenshire as the cabinet member in charge of Grenfell, and GU were getting to know their third housing minister since the fire. The public inquiry was grinding along slowly. The first phase concluded in December. Its report on what happened on the night of the fire, expected to contain recommendations for changes that could protect tens of thousands of other high-rise residents, was due in spring, but never came. On the evening of 19 March 2019, Karim Mussihly walked out of the boardroom at GU Space and screamed in frustration. He had been in there since 11am, and would not finally leave until 9.30pm. The committee was struggling to get answers out of Mark Fisher, director general of the Grenfell public inquiry, about the next steps. The lack of answers was baffling. After all, who was the inquiry for? After Fisher was shown out, the meeting rolled through a crowded landscape of other concerns: people sleeping in buildings with dangerous cladding; poor handling of traumatised Grenfell children by schools; a foul-up by officials planning a permanent memorial on the site of the building; and the detailed work of utility bills and welfare payments for the bereaved and survivors. Elcock rubbed her face with fatigue and frustration. \u201c[We] need to book Brokenshire in a month from now,\u201d she said. Brokenshire, a somewhat bland former corporate lawyer, was now key to achieving the change GU wanted to see. But progress seemed to be slowing. Brexit was too often blamed. The mood was hardening. Ministers and officials were \u201ctaking our kindness for weakness\u201d, Mussihly said. Six weeks later, the meeting with Brokenshire was finally fixed. The GU team arrived at the Palace of Westminster and found a crumbling democratic institution. A protester screamed \u201cStop Brexit\u201d through the railings, a mouse darted across the stone floor of the parliament cafe and water stains ran down the walls leading to committee room 18, where Brokenshire waited. After polite greetings, the meeting settled into a pattern \u2013 the bereaved and survivors took turns to tear strips off the secretary of state for the lack of progress, while Brokenshire\u2019s responses filled time but gave little away. Finally, it got too much to bear. Elcock told him that, since the GU team are not professionals, they have to beg, borrow and steal time from family and work to come to these meetings. The lack of progress \u201cis beyond frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is incompetence or it is indifference.\u201d * * * When Ed Daffarn was battling with Grenfell Tower\u2019s council landlords before the fire, he had been frustrated by their failure to take effective action, or to listen to tenants\u2019 fears. Two years down the line, the ministers in charge of finding housing for survivors and steering the inquiry seemed to be showing the same incompetence. In May, Brokenshire finally allocated \u00a3200m to fix dangerous cladding on private towers, having already allocated \u00a3400m to social housing. But tens of thousands of leaseholders and tenants were still living in properties covered in combustible cladding. The inquiry\u2019s first-phase report, detailing what happened on the night of the fire, was delayed until October 2019, and the second phase of the inquiry, examining the refurbishment, will not start until 2020. Social-housing reforms remain in draft form. As momentum has stalled, the emotional toll on the GU members has risen. \u201cI go to my counselling and say I can handle it if we get the change,\u201d Daffarn said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the change, I don\u2019t know what I am going to do. I feel like I\u2019ll need to leave the country. This is deeply personal for every one of us. From the minute I wake up until I go to bed at night, I pretty much don\u2019t think of anything else apart from trying to get that change.\u201d The GU committee has been propelled to the frontline of battles against social inequality and racial prejudice. Mussihly, who has not been able to find work since becoming a public face of GU, has received nasty abuse on Facebook. One post, alluding to his white wife, read: \u201cTake your muzzy-loving wife and get out of the country. Your families deserved to die in falafel tower.\u201d They also had to watch as a group of bonfire party revellers in south-east London shared a video of a burning effigy of Grenfell Tower with cardboard cut-out residents at the windows. A man has pleaded not guilty to sharing a grossly offensive video and goes on trial next month. A more subtle gulf also persists between the Grenfell families and those in power. Elcock, for one, clearly finds Nick Hurd, the minister for Grenfell survivors, irritating. Hurd, the son of the former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and educated at Eton and Oxford, has a patrician bearing. On a visit to parliament in April to meet ministers, Elcock sarcastically asked one of his officials: \u201cWhere\u2019s Lord Hurd today? Doing some work, is he? That\u2019s nice of him.\u201d When the GU delegation met Hurd later, he was with Kit Malthouse, the housing minister. They had come from the Commons debate about who should pay to fix hundreds of private towers fitted with combustible, Grenfell-style cladding. The government had avoided answering, but the ministers now seemed to be trying to adopt a pally posture with GU: feet spread and hands in pockets like golfers at the 19th hole. \u201cIf something else happens tonight, who is going to be responsible for that?\u201d asked Mussihly. As the ministers shuffled and looked down at their shoes, there was an echo of the pre-fire gulf between RBKC and its tenants: white, middle-aged, public school-educated Conservatives stonewalling the concerns of working-class men and women with heritage from Morocco to Colombia. When it was time to go, Hurd offered handshakes with his face arranged in an expression of sympathy, but Elcock pulled him towards her and refused to let go. \u201cI am still waiting for your email from three weeks ago,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIn an ideal world, I would have one by close of play tomorrow.\u201d Hurd nodded, looking chastened. Outside the gates of Parliament, frustration spilled over. Elgwahary said: \u201cOur families were burned and you have to remind them we are not a normal group. You have to do that to sensitise them.\u201d Coming up to the two-year anniversary, Daffarn is now among those considering a change in strategy. He reckons he has had more than 30 meetings with ministers and civil servants, and knows not enough has been achieved. This spring, he received back a few possessions from his beloved flat: a diary, part of a coffee set his mother left him, and a fridge magnet \u201ccompletely burned to shit\u201d. \u201cYou have to make something good come out of something bad, and what is so terrifying about this is I am beginning to doubt whether that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an empathy gap, but they also have this problem that they are indifferent and incompetent. We had every right to shout at people and be upset. We haven\u2019t done any of that. We have gone in and negotiated. We have worked. We have been grown-up about it.\u201d He said they are considering a different posture. Such was the violence they suffered during the fire, the idea that more violence could help is anathema: GU has been committed to a peaceful, constructive and pragmatic approach. But, in frustration, perhaps, Daffarn now says: \u201cThe one thing they fear is social unrest \u2013 and rightly so. Go to any meeting in Kensington and that anger is still there. It hasn\u2019t dissipated. We wasted 22 months trying to do it this way, and now we have to come up with another solution. We have learned a lot. They failed us.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to correct an earlier version which misdescribed Francis O\u2019Connor as a Grenfell resident.",

It turns out my mum had actually owned two of the dresses and given them both away. It\u2019s a crazy coincidence.</p> <p>I was drawn to the dress because of deep-rooted nostalgia. My mum always wore those types of dresses when we were kids. When I realised the connection, it felt meaningful. A lot of my love for vintage fashion comes from her.

My mum said: \u201cI\u2019ll knit you a jumper.\u201d That was 37 years ago, and that jumper has stayed with me throughout all the highs and lows of my life.</p> <p>In its heyday, it was really warm and fluffy. I\u2019d wear it when I was studying and I couldn\u2019t afford to put the heating on. It\u2019s not so fluffy now, but it\u2019s only in the past year that I\u2019ve had to start patching it up. I asked my mum if she could repair it. She had a go, but said it was beyond her \u2013 she didn\u2019t have the time and patience, or the wool. </p> <p>It\u2019s funny to think it will have only cost her a few pounds to make and that it has lasted this long. If I were to buy a jumper like it, it would cost a lot more, and likely wouldn\u2019t last. Fashion these days changes so quickly. I see people updating their look all the time, and I think how big is your closet? </p> <h2><strong>Paul </strong><strong>Peppiate, 58, is a design manager from Embsay, North Yorkshire.

My mum said to me: \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a company that makes indestructible socks?\u201d When I bought them, from HJ Hall, they looked like normal socks to me. But, 28 years on, I\u2019m still wearing them. </p> <p>I wore them on my wedding day. I don\u2019t think I consciously decided to keep them as a keepsake, but the longer I had them, the more they felt like a memory of the day. They\u2019re like a talisman \u2013 I\u2019ve had them all the time that we\u2019ve been happily married. Indestructible socks equal an indestructible marriage.</p> <p>I treasure things that I\u2019ve had for some time, and these socks fall into that category. Other generations of socks have been and gone, but when I open my drawer, they\u2019re always there: a reliable presence in an unreliable world.</p> <h2><strong>Hel Loader, 55, a nut farmer from Whanganui, New Zealand</strong><strong>, has worn her favourite blue dress on adventures around the world</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ca2985cdc0bceafe718d507f6765813a6d4981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ca2985cdc0bceafe718d507f6765813a6d4981/0_139_924_554/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hel Loader in her beloved dress in Barcelona in 2000.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hel Loader in her beloved dress in Barcelona in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hel Loader</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I bought this dress on Cuba Street in central Wellington when I was 25. There was a stall selling tie-dyed batik outfits. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw this incredible ultramarine blue. I thought: \u201cThat will be easy to wear in summer.\u201d</p> <p>After I bought the dress, I met Scott. He lived in Auckland and, as I lived in Wellington, we had a long-distance relationship for a while. Scott and I both had stressful jobs so we loved to take weekends off and travel around New Zealand. The dress quickly became associated with holidays.</p> <p>Later on, Scott would come home from a stressful day and say: \u201cI\u2019ve had enough.\u201d So we\u2019d chuck a few things in a bag and off we\u2019d go. I\u2019d always bring the dress because if it got crushed or crumpled, the creases would fall right out. Whenever I\u2019d prepare for a trip, Scott always checked to make sure I\u2019d packed it. He liked the colour.</p> <p>Scott wanted to explore the world and we started taking longer trips. In 2000, we spent six months travelling around Central America and the dress came with us. I could wear it hiking or at the end of the day when we went for a beer and a meal. It was just a simple thing: I didn\u2019t have to worry what I looked like because the dress was bright and cheerful, and that\u2019s how I felt. When I look at photos from that trip, I see a young woman, madly in love, looking at the man she loves without a care in the world and her life stretching before her.</p> <p>Before Scott died of pancreatic cancer in 2017, he asked me to scatter his ashes at Cape Finisterre in Spain. It was a special place for Scott \u2013 we had travelled there in 2008. In Roman times, they thought Cape Finisterre was the end of the world. Scott liked that. So I packed the dress, flew to Spain and tipped the bugger off a cliff, just like he wanted.</p> <p>Scott and I always saw ourselves as a great love story. He used to tell me that he loved me without measure or restraint. The dress represents all the times we had together. But it\u2019s just a scrap of fabric, really. When I bought it, I didn\u2019t think any of that. </p> <p>Now, when I come home from the farm and I\u2019m tired, I have a shower and put it on. It still fits, although it\u2019s a bit more snug now and a little worn, but it\u2019s as bright and blue and happy as it ever was.</p> <h2><strong>Petra Tilly, 57, is a play therapist, from Dartmoor.

I used to wear my siblings\u2019 hand-me-downs, but I loved dressing up. My grandmother gave me these 1930s evening gowns and I\u2019d wander around the farmyard with them dragging in the mud.</p> <p>When I was 17, I went to art school in Plymouth. I used to spend a lot of time vintage shopping \u2013 I loved the hunt. This Edwardian jacket was the first vintage piece I ever bought. I\u2019d wear it with patched-up old Levi\u2019s, or over a dress. It was an exciting time: I was just heading out into the world and everything seemed possible.</p> <p>After I finished my degree, I met an older man who was very interesting, but also abusive and controlling. He would often tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t wear. The only way to escape was to throw some clothes in a bag and run away with my son, which is how I found myself a single parent in the mid-1980s. Money was tight and I had to sell my vintage clothing collection to make ends meet. But I couldn\u2019t bear to sell the jacket. It was a bit of the old me, from before I met him. It held the memory of my younger, flamboyant, art-student self.</p> <p>I wore the jacket when my husband and I got married, on Dartmoor, in 1995. I had to wear it, because it had seen me through good times and bad \u2013 and my wedding was a particularly special and joyous time for me. Even though the jacket\u2019s looking a bit tatty now, I still wouldn\u2019t part with it. </p> <h2><strong>Pete Maclean, 68, is a software developer</strong><strong>, who </strong><strong>lives in Virginia</strong><strong>.

I saw this suit in the window of a shop on 8th Street and it just yelled to me that I had to buy it. Because I\u2019m so tall and thin, it can be hard for me to find clothes, but when I tried it on, it fitted perfectly.</p> <p>I was living it up at the time. I had a very fulfilling job, a good social life and I\u2019d go out to the disco. It was one of the happier periods of my life. I grew up in Scotland, but I\u2019d been courageous and taken myself to the US. Things had worked out for me and I was very grateful. The suit was a symbol of how I\u2019d built the life for myself that I wanted. If I could go back in time to that period, I\u2019d whisper to myself: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. Just keep it up. It\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve had the suit since I was 28 and I\u2019m reluctant to get rid of it because I\u2019d never be able to find one like it again. It\u2019s as good as new \u2013 I still wear it occasionally, although not as much as I did in the 1970s.</p> <p>As I get older I grow less attached to material things. I throw things out because I want to make my life leaner. It\u2019s just a few things and a few people that are really valuable that I hold on to \u2013 the others fall off the edges and I let them go.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to correct a misspelling of the family name of Paul Peppiate as Peppiatt.</p>",

The popularity of \u201chaul culture\u201d, the ubiquity of Primark on high streets and the rise of ultra-low-cost online retailers has got the British public hooked on fast fashion.

It is estimated that the secondhand or resale market could be bigger than fast fashion within a decade as we become more aware of the social and environmental impact of cheap clothes. And the slow-fashion movement \u2013 encouraging people to buy ethically made items of clothing sparingly, repair them when necessary and keep them for life \u2013 is growing in popularity.

It\u2019s funny to think it will have only cost her a few pounds to make and that it has lasted this long. If I were to buy a jumper like it, it would cost a lot more, and likely wouldn\u2019t last. Fashion these days changes so quickly. I see people updating their look all the time, and I think how big is your closet? Paul Peppiate, 58, is a design manager from Embsay, North Yorkshire. He has worn his \u2018indestructible\u2019 green socks for 28 years When I was younger, I used to go walking a lot and my socks would always go into holes. My mum said to me: \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a company that makes indestructible socks?\u201d When I bought them, from HJ Hall, they looked like normal socks to me. But, 28 years on, I\u2019m still wearing them. I wore them on my wedding day. I don\u2019t think I consciously decided to keep them as a keepsake, but the longer I had them, the more they felt like a memory of the day. They\u2019re like a talisman \u2013 I\u2019ve had them all the time that we\u2019ve been happily married. Indestructible socks equal an indestructible marriage. I treasure things that I\u2019ve had for some time, and these socks fall into that category. Other generations of socks have been and gone, but when I open my drawer, they\u2019re always there: a reliable presence in an unreliable world. Hel Loader, 55, a nut farmer from Whanganui, New Zealand, has worn her favourite blue dress on adventures around the world I bought this dress on Cuba Street in central Wellington when I was 25. There was a stall selling tie-dyed batik outfits. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw this incredible ultramarine blue. I thought: \u201cThat will be easy to wear in summer.\u201d After I bought the dress, I met Scott. He lived in Auckland and, as I lived in Wellington, we had a long-distance relationship for a while. Scott and I both had stressful jobs so we loved to take weekends off and travel around New Zealand. The dress quickly became associated with holidays. Later on, Scott would come home from a stressful day and say: \u201cI\u2019ve had enough.\u201d So we\u2019d chuck a few things in a bag and off we\u2019d go. I\u2019d always bring the dress because if it got crushed or crumpled, the creases would fall right out. Whenever I\u2019d prepare for a trip, Scott always checked to make sure I\u2019d packed it. He liked the colour. Scott wanted to explore the world and we started taking longer trips. In 2000, we spent six months travelling around Central America and the dress came with us. I could wear it hiking or at the end of the day when we went for a beer and a meal. It was just a simple thing: I didn\u2019t have to worry what I looked like because the dress was bright and cheerful, and that\u2019s how I felt. When I look at photos from that trip, I see a young woman, madly in love, looking at the man she loves without a care in the world and her life stretching before her. Before Scott died of pancreatic cancer in 2017, he asked me to scatter his ashes at Cape Finisterre in Spain. It was a special place for Scott \u2013 we had travelled there in 2008. In Roman times, they thought Cape Finisterre was the end of the world. Scott liked that. So I packed the dress, flew to Spain and tipped the bugger off a cliff, just like he wanted. Scott and I always saw ourselves as a great love story. He used to tell me that he loved me without measure or restraint. The dress represents all the times we had together. But it\u2019s just a scrap of fabric, really. When I bought it, I didn\u2019t think any of that. Now, when I come home from the farm and I\u2019m tired, I have a shower and put it on. It still fits, although it\u2019s a bit more snug now and a little worn, but it\u2019s as bright and blue and happy as it ever was. Petra Tilly, 57, is a play therapist, from Dartmoor. She has treasured an Edwardian jacket for most of her adult life I grew up on a hill farm in Dartmoor, the youngest of three children. I used to wear my siblings\u2019 hand-me-downs, but I loved dressing up. My grandmother gave me these 1930s evening gowns and I\u2019d wander around the farmyard with them dragging in the mud. When I was 17, I went to art school in Plymouth. I used to spend a lot of time vintage shopping \u2013 I loved the hunt. This Edwardian jacket was the first vintage piece I ever bought. I\u2019d wear it with patched-up old Levi\u2019s, or over a dress. It was an exciting time: I was just heading out into the world and everything seemed possible. After I finished my degree, I met an older man who was very interesting, but also abusive and controlling. He would often tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t wear. The only way to escape was to throw some clothes in a bag and run away with my son, which is how I found myself a single parent in the mid-1980s. Money was tight and I had to sell my vintage clothing collection to make ends meet. But I couldn\u2019t bear to sell the jacket. It was a bit of the old me, from before I met him. It held the memory of my younger, flamboyant, art-student self. I wore the jacket when my husband and I got married, on Dartmoor, in 1995. I had to wear it, because it had seen me through good times and bad \u2013 and my wedding was a particularly special and joyous time for me. Even though the jacket\u2019s looking a bit tatty now, I still wouldn\u2019t part with it. Pete Maclean, 68, is a software developer, who lives in Virginia. He bought his three-piece red suit in New York in the 1970s I moved to New York in the 1970s as a student before getting a job at New York University. I saw this suit in the window of a shop on 8th Street and it just yelled to me that I had to buy it. Because I\u2019m so tall and thin, it can be hard for me to find clothes, but when I tried it on, it fitted perfectly. I was living it up at the time. I had a very fulfilling job, a good social life and I\u2019d go out to the disco. It was one of the happier periods of my life. I grew up in Scotland, but I\u2019d been courageous and taken myself to the US. Things had worked out for me and I was very grateful. The suit was a symbol of how I\u2019d built the life for myself that I wanted. If I could go back in time to that period, I\u2019d whisper to myself: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great. Just keep it up. It\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u201d I\u2019ve had the suit since I was 28 and I\u2019m reluctant to get rid of it because I\u2019d never be able to find one like it again. It\u2019s as good as new \u2013 I still wear it occasionally, although not as much as I did in the 1970s. As I get older I grow less attached to material things. I throw things out because I want to make my life leaner. It\u2019s just a few things and a few people that are really valuable that I hold on to \u2013 the others fall off the edges and I let them go. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 to correct a misspelling of the family name of Paul Peppiate as Peppiatt.",

Trump\u2019s presidency is about trashing constitutionally imposed checks and balances, dumping on the first amendment, sating the cravings of social conservatives and race-baiting. Acosta\u2019s brand is about getting into Trump\u2019s face and under his skin.</p> <p>Acosta cops to \u201cgrandstanding\u201d, \u201cshowboating\u201d and, on occasion, \u201copt[ing] for the bait\u201d. For such efforts, the White House stripped Acosta of his press pass, which was restored after a successful legal challenge.</p> <p>Acosta\u2019s book sheds real light on the West Wing funhouse. It explains how the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d emerged as a mainstay of Trump\u2019s lexicon: blame it on Steve Bannon. Acosta also catches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/10/jared-kushner-real-estate-cadre-goldman-sachs\">Jared Kushner, the first son-in-law</a>, lying through his teeth from the get-go.</p> <p>Acosta reports meeting Kushner at the White House in the aftermath of Michael Flynn being dismissed as national security adviser. Kushner calls Acosta \u201cthe fake news guy\u201d, then is asked why he calls CNN fake news.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Neutrality for the sake of neutrality doesn\u2019t really serve us in the age of Trump</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Acosta</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Russia story, he responded. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As Acosta puts it: \u201cThat was not true.

But then again, Kushner wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the West Wing or holding a security clearance in a normal administration, let alone be tasked with bringing peace to the Middle East.</p> <p>Acosta also depicts a \u201ctipsy\u201d Reince Priebus, then head of the Republican National Committee, telling the author very early on election morning it was \u201cgoing to take a miracle for us to win\u201d. As the CNN man put it, Priebus \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abrn8aVQ76Q\">just walked up in a bit of stupor and uttered those unbelievable words</a>. So, I let him talk.\u201d And to think, Priebus\u2019s ex-boss is a teetotaler.</p> <p>Compared to its predecessors in the realm of the Trump expos\u00e9, The Enemy of the People lacks the acid-dripping punch of Michael Wolff\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff\">Fire and Fury</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/siege-review-michael-wolff-trump-fire-and-fury\">Siege</a>, the granularity of Bob Woodward\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/08/fear-review-bob-woodward-donald-trump\">Fear</a> and the salaciousness of Stormy Daniels\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/22/full-disclosure-review-stormy-daniels-donald-trump-sex\">Full Disclosure</a>. In a universe already cluttered by \u201ctell-alls\u201d by administration alumni and discards like Omarosa, Spicey and the Mooch, the bar is high for whatever comes next.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Acosta\u2019s quotes and anecdotes are frequently sourced to unnamed White House officials and political insiders. For example, we are told that at least one member of the administration views Trump as \u201cinsane\u201d and another sees him as potentially \u201ccompromised\u201d by the Russians.

      "bodyText": "In Donald Trump\u2019s self-manufactured reality, disdain for journalists and affinity for autocrats are among few constants. By the same measure, the president craves the adulation of the press the way a junkie hankers for a wakeup fix. Trump denounces the New York Times as \u201cfailing\u201d and \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d, but yearns for Maggie Haberman\u2019s approval. No mommy issues there. Enter CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, Trump\u2019s on-air sparring partner, with a book entitled \u2026 The Enemy of the People. Trump\u2019s presidency is about trashing constitutionally imposed checks and balances, dumping on the first amendment, sating the cravings of social conservatives and race-baiting. Acosta\u2019s brand is about getting into Trump\u2019s face and under his skin. Acosta cops to \u201cgrandstanding\u201d, \u201cshowboating\u201d and, on occasion, \u201copt[ing] for the bait\u201d. For such efforts, the White House stripped Acosta of his press pass, which was restored after a successful legal challenge. Acosta\u2019s book sheds real light on the West Wing funhouse. It explains how the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d emerged as a mainstay of Trump\u2019s lexicon: blame it on Steve Bannon. Acosta also catches Jared Kushner, the first son-in-law, lying through his teeth from the get-go. Acosta reports meeting Kushner at the White House in the aftermath of Michael Flynn being dismissed as national security adviser. Kushner calls Acosta \u201cthe fake news guy\u201d, then is asked why he calls CNN fake news. \u201cThe Russia story, he responded. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to it.\u2019\u201d As Acosta puts it: \u201cThat was not true. Not by a long shot.\u201d Kushner\u2019s name appears in both volumes and on 47 pages of Robert Mueller\u2019s report. But then again, Kushner wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the West Wing or holding a security clearance in a normal administration, let alone be tasked with bringing peace to the Middle East. Acosta also depicts a \u201ctipsy\u201d Reince Priebus, then head of the Republican National Committee, telling the author very early on election morning it was \u201cgoing to take a miracle for us to win\u201d. As the CNN man put it, Priebus \u201cjust walked up in a bit of stupor and uttered those unbelievable words. So, I let him talk.\u201d And to think, Priebus\u2019s ex-boss is a teetotaler. Compared to its predecessors in the realm of the Trump expos\u00e9, The Enemy of the People lacks the acid-dripping punch of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and Siege, the granularity of Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear and the salaciousness of Stormy Daniels\u2019 Full Disclosure. In a universe already cluttered by \u201ctell-alls\u201d by administration alumni and discards like Omarosa, Spicey and the Mooch, the bar is high for whatever comes next. Unfortunately, Acosta\u2019s quotes and anecdotes are frequently sourced to unnamed White House officials and political insiders. For example, we are told that at least one member of the administration views Trump as \u201cinsane\u201d and another sees him as potentially \u201ccompromised\u201d by the Russians. On such topics, Acosta glides across well-tilled ground. Last September, an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times boasted of active resistance to Trump within his own administration. Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, reportedly denounced his boss as a \u201cmoron\u201d. Trump has proclaimed himself a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d. Acosta acknowledges Trump\u2019s working class base and captures the shock that reverberated with his upset win. But he fails to place the rage and resentment in the larger context of how America and the west reached this inflection point. Unlike Hillary Clinton, Trump was not just a candidate. He embodied a movement. Like it or not. Trump, Nigel Farage, Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orban and Benjamin Netanyahu are on stage at the same moment. Grievance toward elites and immigration are themes with ready audiences on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond. And yes, Acosta should address all this after he tacitly cops to acting like an advocate or editorialist, as opposed to simply reporting breaking news or calling balls and strikes. In his words: \u201cNeutrality for the sake of neutrality doesn\u2019t really serve us in the age of Trump.\u201d Lest Acosta forget, Edward R Murrow\u2019s takedown of Joe McCarthy and Walter Cronkite\u2019s editorial on the Vietnam war carried sway because Murrow and Cronkite possessed gravitas and credibility. They also respected boundaries and lines. When Paul LePage, Maine\u2019s then-governor, told an interviewer \u201cour constitution is not only broken, but we need a Donald Trump to show some authoritarian power in our country\u201d, he was speaking for an audience larger than himself or even Trump. A majority of the GOP now believes the press is the enemy of the people, more than two-in-five Republicans think the president should be able to shutter media outlets for \u201cbad behavior\u201d, and a similar number cast a kind eye towards Russia and Vladimir Putin. During the 2016 campaign, Trump made NBC\u2019s Katy Tur a foil and focal point. In the end Tur had a passel of death threats and a security detail to show for it, but only after Trump had telephoned her and, sounding like a stalker or mob boss, said: \u201cBe fair to me Katy \u2026 you and I should be friends.\u201d Nothing has changed.

During his four-month tenure as Brexit secretary, he lost trust of his EU counterparts. \u201cHe was seen to be working against his prime minister and making things up,\u201d the first EU source said.</p> \n<p>The European commission recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/23/brussels-rejects-fraudulent-raab-claim-used-in-election-video\">accused Raab</a> of making \u201cfraudulent\u201d claims and spreading \u201cpure disinformation\u201d in a campaign video about the views of its secretary-general, Selmayr, on the future of Ireland.</p> \n<p>Responding to unfavourable reports from Brussels, Raab told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that it \u201cprobably tells you that I was doing my job in terms of pressing them hard and making sure that Britain\u2019s interests were resolutely defended\u201d.</p> \n<p>Candidates deemed compromise choices at Westminster have also inspired mistrust in Brussels. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is reported to have struck a different tone on Brexit with his EU counterparts than the public stance he takes in the UK. \u201cHe gave a very different impression than what he is suggesting now,\u201d an EU diplomat said. More recently, Hunt has toned down his views on no deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/hunt-push-for-no-deal-brexit-would-be-political-suicide\">warning it would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d.</a></p> \n<p>EU officials expect Tory candidates will be falling over themselves to prove their hard-Brexit credentials, following the party\u2019s poor showing in the European elections, where just four of its MEPs were elected and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party won the most votes. \u201cThe Tory party will be in survival mode and \u2026 will have to regain credibility as the party of Brexit,\u201d another EU source said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"48718617-39ff-43f6-86a7-0f462acf4b95\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His style is notably technocratic, with few rhetorical flourishes and an emphasis on his consensual approach and long record as a minister, notably during more than five years as health secretary, a traditional graveyard of ministerial careers. Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse.</p>\n    <p>Overall, Hunt\u2019s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs \u2013 one that is more catchy than accurate (since May herself often wears trousers).</p>\n    <p><b>In the final round of MP voting Hunt edged out Michael Gove, 77 votes to 75.</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson\u2019s progress to Downing Street appeared unstoppable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/23/boris-johnson-bid-for-tory-leadership-gathers-momentum\">even before an overwhelming victory in the first round of voting among MPs</a>.

We were wrong. Tusk was wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201c[Macron] closed the door [to another extension] and it\u2019s not shut, but the wind is blowing against it. And the harder Johnson\u2019s rhetoric, and harder Raab\u2019s rhetoric, the harder it is to open the door.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about the Tory contest last month, Tusk said there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/theresa-may-blames-brexit-failure-for-european-election-humiliation\">\u201cnothing promising\u201d</a> in \u201cthe state of affairs in London\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many in the EU would support an extension for what is known in Brussels as \u201ca democratic event\u201d, meaning a general election or a second referendum.</p> \n<p>Without that, Piris thinks EU leaders could say no to a further extension. \u201cBut even if they say yes. What would happen? There is an inability to solve this question in the House of Commons.\u201d</p> \n<p>He stresses the Brexit conundrum is not down to an individual Tory leader. \u201cIt is a question of the political system of the UK being unable to answer to such a unique event in the life of the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lamberts warns that nothing will change for May\u2019s successor, as the EU will refuse to reopen the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop. \u201cAnyone who steps into Downing Street will face exactly the same constraints. Saying you want to renegotiate this agreement is nice and well, but it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Tory contest is not keeping Brussels on the edge of its seat. \u201cWe really don\u2019t care very much [who wins]\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cFrom an EU point of view, we would rather see someone that could deliver a smooth, orderly Brexit. Whether Johnson is going to be able to deliver it, the UK is going to have to ask itself.\u201d</p>",

Many EU insiders think the chances of no deal have increased, with the Tory party expected to choose a Brexiter prime minister. \u201cFor me it is very clear the odds of no-deal Brexit are more than half and clearly if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister the odds will go up again,\u201d said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP and member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Another favourite, Dominic Raab, is held in low-esteem in Brussels. During his four-month tenure as Brexit secretary, he lost trust of his EU counterparts. \u201cHe was seen to be working against his prime minister and making things up,\u201d the first EU source said. The European commission recently accused Raab of making \u201cfraudulent\u201d claims and spreading \u201cpure disinformation\u201d in a campaign video about the views of its secretary-general, Selmayr, on the future of Ireland. Responding to unfavourable reports from Brussels, Raab told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that it \u201cprobably tells you that I was doing my job in terms of pressing them hard and making sure that Britain\u2019s interests were resolutely defended\u201d. Candidates deemed compromise choices at Westminster have also inspired mistrust in Brussels. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is reported to have struck a different tone on Brexit with his EU counterparts than the public stance he takes in the UK. \u201cHe gave a very different impression than what he is suggesting now,\u201d an EU diplomat said. More recently, Hunt has toned down his views on no deal, warning it would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d. EU officials expect Tory candidates will be falling over themselves to prove their hard-Brexit credentials, following the party\u2019s poor showing in the European elections, where just four of its MEPs were elected and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party won the most votes. \u201cThe Tory party will be in survival mode and \u2026 will have to regain credibility as the party of Brexit,\u201d another EU source said. For many, the leadership race is an unedifying fight for power, while the clock ticks down remorselessly to Brexit day on 31 October. More governments are coming round to the tough position of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who argued against a long extension on the grounds that Brexit would become a damaging and distracting burden for the EU. Donald Tusk, the European council president, helped persuade member states to back a longer extension, which he urged the UK not to waste. \u201cWe were definitely on the other side of Macron,\u201d the diplomat recalled. \u201cNow I think Macron was right. We were wrong. Tusk was wrong.\u201d \u201c[Macron] closed the door [to another extension] and it\u2019s not shut, but the wind is blowing against it. And the harder Johnson\u2019s rhetoric, and harder Raab\u2019s rhetoric, the harder it is to open the door.\u201d Asked about the Tory contest last month, Tusk said there was \u201cnothing promising\u201d in \u201cthe state of affairs in London\u201d. Many in the EU would support an extension for what is known in Brussels as \u201ca democratic event\u201d, meaning a general election or a second referendum. Without that, Piris thinks EU leaders could say no to a further extension. \u201cBut even if they say yes. What would happen? There is an inability to solve this question in the House of Commons.\u201d He stresses the Brexit conundrum is not down to an individual Tory leader. \u201cIt is a question of the political system of the UK being unable to answer to such a unique event in the life of the nation.\u201d Lamberts warns that nothing will change for May\u2019s successor, as the EU will refuse to reopen the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop. \u201cAnyone who steps into Downing Street will face exactly the same constraints. Saying you want to renegotiate this agreement is nice and well, but it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Tory contest is not keeping Brussels on the edge of its seat. \u201cWe really don\u2019t care very much [who wins]\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cFrom an EU point of view, we would rather see someone that could deliver a smooth, orderly Brexit. Whether Johnson is going to be able to deliver it, the UK is going to have to ask itself.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has not ruled out asking former White House strategist Steve Bannon to help run his 2020 presidential campaign, according to a new book about the Trump administration. Bannon has recently been in Europe, seeking to boost populism across the continent. But judging by The Best People: Trump\u2019s Cabinet and the Siege on Washington, a book by Alexander Nazaryan of Yahoo News which will be published next week, he could soon be on his way back to Washington. The Guardian obtained a copy. Like Michael Wolff\u2019s pair of books about the Trump campaign and White House, The Best People is heavily reliant on interviews with Bannon, demonstrating the former adviser\u2019s continued influence in crafting public perceptions of Trump and Trumpism.

But Nazaryan reveals that just in time for what looks to be a desperate re-election fight, and notwithstanding Bannon\u2019s controversial comments to Wolff for his new book, Siege, Bannon appears to have returned to Trump\u2019s good graces. In an interview with Trump carried out in February 2019, Nazaryan asks the president if he would rehire Bannon, a former Breitbart News executive who has extolled the political usefulness of anger and fear, for his 2020 campaign.

      "bodyText": "Why are so many religious citizens drawn to the rhetoric of authoritarian leaders such as Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Jair Bolsonaro and Narendra Modi? Even in countries with a strong secular tradition, such as France and the Netherlands, rightwing populists like Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders are quick to resort to language that presents \u201cJudeo-Christianity\u201d as the pillar of western European civilisation. In Belgium, the Flemish nationalist party N-VA has made a name for itself defending institutions \u201cabandoned\u201d by the Christian-Democrats, such as the Catholic schooling system and church services. In Italy, Salvini ostentatiously brandished a Catholic rosary as results from the European elections came in. In Hungary, Orb\u00e1n has turned a defence of \u201cChristian civilisation\u201d into official state doctrine. Making a speech in Warsaw, where the ruling Law and Justice party has presented itself as the political wing of conservative Catholicism, Donald Trump echoed John Paul II\u2019s old invocation: \u201cWe want God.\u201d Clearly there is a key link between populism and religion. But there seems to have been relatively little academic interest in the connection. Jan-Werner M\u00fcller\u2019s What is Populism? (2016), for example, spends no time discussing the relationship at all. This is all the stranger, given that the movement that launched the term \u201cpopulism\u201d \u2013 the original \u201cbig P\u201d Populists in the late 19th-century US \u2013 was fiercely churchgoing. As a coalition of anti-capitalist radical agrarians and workers, the Populists drew on previous Methodist networks (mainly in the south) and sources in the American evangelical tradition. They called their movement the \u201ccooperative crusade\u201d. We no longer live in such an age of mass participation, whether in politics or religion. Parties and civil associations have experienced a dramatic decline in the past 30 years, across all western democracies. Traditional churches have lost their followers to new communities of belief. Yet there are very good reasons to view much of today\u2019s populism as, to some degree, a religious backlash. The Eurasian traditionalism of Vladimir Putin, the Christian-Democracy of Orb\u00e1n, the Judeo-Christianity of Trump, the prosperity Pentecostalism of Bolsonaro, the populist Catholicism of Salvini and the Hindu-nationalism of Modi, all speak of a religiously infused reaction to secular governance. What has been eroding for the past few decades is not simply democratic or liberal values per se; there has also been a growing suspicion of secularism and the secular elites who propagate it. This process began with the rise of US evangelicalism in the late 1970s. It not only led to political successes at home but also to global missionary expansions into Latin America and Africa, which exported a suspicion of all things secular. It is telling that we fail to see the global theological counter-revolution taking place right before our eyes. This dimension of our political moment might go a long way to explain why rightwing populists have scored so many victories in recent years: populists have proven very adept at hijacking religion. The deployment of religion is not about the doctrinal strength of religious life \u2013 religious practice continues to decline steadily in most western democracies, and most citizens are not involved in religious institutions. Instead, populists\u2019 use of religion seems to offer a way of forging a new consensus. It is a tool to engage a society that is felt to have lost its moral centre. The French fascist Charles Maurras said that he did not believe in God but \u201cthought it crucial that people believed in him\u201d. Amid the dizzying effects of globalisation, \u201cGod and country\u201d populism offers a way of incorporating capitalism into some kind of traditional religious framework.

It is framed around the story of Claire (Aisling Fanciosi), a 21-year-old Irish former convict who finds herself trapped by a brutal master, Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin).</p> \n<p>Within the first half hour, Claire is held down and raped multiple times by multiple people, with camera framing that forces the viewer to watch the pain in her face \u2013 almost from the vantage point of her rapist. <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/cinemagoers-walk-out-and-yell-criticism-during-the-nightingale-premiere-in-sydney/news-story/caff28ba212a573619fe1ed29bc98b2e\">According to one report</a>, audience members at the film\u2019s Sunday night screening in Randwick walked out of the cinema, with one woman shouting, \u201cShe\u2019s already been raped, we don\u2019t need to see it again.\u201d</p> \n<p>The final time Claire is raped, her husband and baby are murdered in the same room, in a scene punctured by loud shouts from the Monday night audience. She then pays a local Indigenous man, Billy (Baykali Ganambarr), a shilling to guide her to Launceston, where she hopes to have her revenge.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/06/the-nightingale-review-jennifer-kent\">The Nightingale review: Babadook director delivers devilish revenge tale</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As Claire and Billy take off on the journey that will bring them closer together, the audience bears witness to more pointblank murders by the English invaders, particularly of Indigenous people, one of whom \u2013 a woman with a toddler \u2013 had been taken as a sex slave.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the audience on Monday night, after a screening from which a handful more audience members walked out, Kent said she understood that the rape scenes would be difficult to watch, as they had been difficult to make \u2013 but that she believed they had not been shot in a distasteful way.</p> \n<p>By focusing on the faces of the women rather than their bodies, she said, she wanted audiences to reckon with the pain and trauma of female convicts from the era. These women were outnumbered eight to one and suffered so much at the hands of their masters \u2013 rape, beatings and psychological abuse \u2013 that they would deliberately commit small crimes, just to be locked up in solitary confinement for three weeks at a time.</p> \n<p>In a comment released to media on Monday, Kent said both she and Franciosi had been contacted by victims of sexual violence who were grateful for the movie. \u201cI do not believe this would be happening if the film was at all gratuitous or exploitative,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhilst The Nightingale contains historically accurate depictions of colonial violence and racism towards our Indigenous people, the film is not \u2018about\u2019 violence \u2026 We\u2019ve made this film in collaboration with Tasmanian Aboriginal elders, and they feel it\u2019s an honest and necessary depiction of their history and a story that needs to be told. I remain enormously proud of the film.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jim Everett, a Tasmanian Indigenous elder who was brought in on the treatment and worked on the film through to post-production, is an executive producer. \u201cYou rarely see the truth being told even in documentaries about what happened in Tasmania, that there was a definite attempt at genocide,\u201d he says in the film\u2019s production notes. \u201cI felt that as a fiction it reflected real history, and so I should give it my support.\u201d</p> \n<p>In fact, Kent said, when it came to colonial violence against Indigenous Australians in Tasmania, the film actually held back. \u201cIf we showed what <em>really</em> happened in Tasmania in 1825, no audience could bear it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Nightingale is the first full-length film to feature Palawa Kani, a reconstructed dialect drawn from the near-extinct Indigenous Tasmanian language, which Kent said developed further as her movie was made.</p> \n<p>The movie premiered at Venice film festival last year, where it was the only female-led film in the main competition, and where it won the special jury prize.</p> \n<p>When asked on Monday what she expected people to walk out of the cinema feeling, Kent said: \u201cI try not to have expectations. I never expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/11/the-babadook-how-horror-movie-monster-became-a-gay-icon\">the Babadook to become a gay icon</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Babadook director Jennifer Kent has defended her new film The Nightingale as an \u201chonest and necessary depiction\u201d of a brutal historical moment, after rape scenes and graphic violence caused some ticket holders to walk out of screenings on Sunday and Monday night. The film, written and directed by Kent, is set in 1825 Tasmania during the frontier war massacres of Indigenous Australians. It is framed around the story of Claire (Aisling Fanciosi), a 21-year-old Irish former convict who finds herself trapped by a brutal master, Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin). Within the first half hour, Claire is held down and raped multiple times by multiple people, with camera framing that forces the viewer to watch the pain in her face \u2013 almost from the vantage point of her rapist. According to one report, audience members at the film\u2019s Sunday night screening in Randwick walked out of the cinema, with one woman shouting, \u201cShe\u2019s already been raped, we don\u2019t need to see it again.\u201d The final time Claire is raped, her husband and baby are murdered in the same room, in a scene punctured by loud shouts from the Monday night audience. She then pays a local Indigenous man, Billy (Baykali Ganambarr), a shilling to guide her to Launceston, where she hopes to have her revenge. As Claire and Billy take off on the journey that will bring them closer together, the audience bears witness to more pointblank murders by the English invaders, particularly of Indigenous people, one of whom \u2013 a woman with a toddler \u2013 had been taken as a sex slave. Speaking to the audience on Monday night, after a screening from which a handful more audience members walked out, Kent said she understood that the rape scenes would be difficult to watch, as they had been difficult to make \u2013 but that she believed they had not been shot in a distasteful way. By focusing on the faces of the women rather than their bodies, she said, she wanted audiences to reckon with the pain and trauma of female convicts from the era. These women were outnumbered eight to one and suffered so much at the hands of their masters \u2013 rape, beatings and psychological abuse \u2013 that they would deliberately commit small crimes, just to be locked up in solitary confinement for three weeks at a time. In a comment released to media on Monday, Kent said both she and Franciosi had been contacted by victims of sexual violence who were grateful for the movie. \u201cI do not believe this would be happening if the film was at all gratuitous or exploitative,\u201d she said. \u201cWhilst The Nightingale contains historically accurate depictions of colonial violence and racism towards our Indigenous people, the film is not \u2018about\u2019 violence \u2026 We\u2019ve made this film in collaboration with Tasmanian Aboriginal elders, and they feel it\u2019s an honest and necessary depiction of their history and a story that needs to be told. I remain enormously proud of the film.\u201d Jim Everett, a Tasmanian Indigenous elder who was brought in on the treatment and worked on the film through to post-production, is an executive producer. \u201cYou rarely see the truth being told even in documentaries about what happened in Tasmania, that there was a definite attempt at genocide,\u201d he says in the film\u2019s production notes. \u201cI felt that as a fiction it reflected real history, and so I should give it my support.\u201d In fact, Kent said, when it came to colonial violence against Indigenous Australians in Tasmania, the film actually held back. \u201cIf we showed what really happened in Tasmania in 1825, no audience could bear it.\u201d The Nightingale is the first full-length film to feature Palawa Kani, a reconstructed dialect drawn from the near-extinct Indigenous Tasmanian language, which Kent said developed further as her movie was made. The movie premiered at Venice film festival last year, where it was the only female-led film in the main competition, and where it won the special jury prize. When asked on Monday what she expected people to walk out of the cinema feeling, Kent said: \u201cI try not to have expectations. I never expected the Babadook to become a gay icon. But it\u2019s 2019, and here we are.\u201d",

At every step of the way it has confounded expectations and refused to follow any sort of pattern. What we have left is a series of questions: Can the Raptors come back mentally after whiffing on a golden opportunity to seal their first championship in front of their home crowd? Can the Warriors keep going despite their continuing injury luck, most likely without even the hope of Durant returning to play series savior? Who knows. All that\u2019s certain now is that it\u2019s a 3-2 series. There will be a Game 6 will be on Thursday in Oracle Arena, whether that\u2019s the end point or just another stop on route a Game 7 remains to be seen.</p> \n  <p>The Guardian will continue to have coverage of the NBA Finals but this will conclude today\u2019s liveblog.

That\u2019s the question here in Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors. With their Game 4 win at Oracle Arena, the Raptors took a commanding 3-1 lead in the series and now the game returns to Toronto\u2019s Scotiabank Arena for what could be the final game of the NBA season and a symbolic conclusion to the Warriors\u2019 reign as the league\u2019s unstoppable juggernaut.</p> \n  <p>To put things in the starkest terms possible, the Warriors would need to win three straight (starting today) in order to pull off a comeback. which funnily enough means they have to take inspiration from the last team who did that: LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, who pulled off that feat against (you guessed it) the Golden State Warriors in 2016. In the role of James might be Kevin Durant, who has been out for weeks with a calf injury but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/10/kevin-durant-nba-finals-injury-golden-state-warriors?CMP=share_btn_tw\">will attempt to play today</a>. It\u2019s good news for Golden State, but there\u2019s a very real concern about how much they can expect from Durant given that he\u2019s coming back from a serious injury and is immediately being thrown into a literal must-win game.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the Raptors will be battling in front of a home crowd with the perfect opportunity to win their first championship. In fact, they\u2019re playing for an entire country, as no Canadian team has ever won an NBA championship (the Grizzlies didn\u2019t spend enough time in Vancouver to get a decent shot). The beyond stoic Kawhi Leonard, who may be headed towards an entirely different team this offseason, has a chance to finalize a playoff performance of the ages here if the Raptors manage to end this in the next couple of hours. They certainly don\u2019t want to let the Warriors back into the series. The next game would be back at Oracle Arena for a final game in that venue\u2019s history and then would come a Game 7 where anything can happen.<br></p> \n  <p>So, shortly we will get be celebrating a Raptors championship or the start of a memorable Warriors comeback. That sounds like it will be fun no matter. If you want to contribute to the liveblog feel free to send your thoughts here either via email (to <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com\">hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com</a> or tweet them here (to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a>) and we\u2019ll include them along the way.

      "bodyText": "Warriors GM Bob Myers has confirmed that Kevin Durant has an achilles injury. The severity of the injury isn\u2019t clear but it almost certainly ends KD\u2019s series. What more can you say about this Finals? At every step of the way it has confounded expectations and refused to follow any sort of pattern. What we have left is a series of questions: Can the Raptors come back mentally after whiffing on a golden opportunity to seal their first championship in front of their home crowd? Can the Warriors keep going despite their continuing injury luck, most likely without even the hope of Durant returning to play series savior? Who knows. All that\u2019s certain now is that it\u2019s a 3-2 series. There will be a Game 6 will be on Thursday in Oracle Arena, whether that\u2019s the end point or just another stop on route a Game 7 remains to be seen. The Guardian will continue to have coverage of the NBA Finals but this will conclude today\u2019s liveblog. Make sure you read our game report linked below. Thanks to everybody for following along with us, particularly all those who contributed along the way. Ciao! I hate to do this to the guy, but for posterity it\u2019s probably worthwhile to record the fact that Kyle Lowry\u2019s attempted game-winner will not win over anybody skill skeptical about his postseason play. Steve Kerr attempts to summarize just what happened in the last few hours; Email from Peter Oh: We the west. A gutty emotional win for the Warriors. There\u2019s something to be said about Finals experience, it seems. Meanwhile, although disappointed, the Raptors have to still feel good about their chances. They almost just stole a game here. They have two more chances to win, including a Game 7 on the road. The Warriors have to worry about not having Durant and possibly Looney. I am still processing what just happened here. The Warriors almost lost control of things here, but they managed to come back late from a six point deficit with less than two minutes left in the game. Of course, they will likely have to win the next two games without Durant, who looks to be quite seriously hurt after his comeback attempt was cut short. There will be a Game 6 and one last game in Oracle Arena! Wow! Warriors 106-105 Raptors, FINAL Cousins gets called for a moving screen! Offensive turnover! This is disastrous for Golden State. The Raptors have a chance to win it right here. Lowry gets off a shot and\u2026 it\u2019s NO GOOD. The Warriors survive Game 5! Warriors 106-105 Raptors, 29.9, 4th quarter Gasol misses out of the Raptors timeout, Cousins gets a key rebound but Draymond Green gets called for a back court violation. This is getting crazy. Raptors have another chance here, and they get the benefit of a goal-tend call on Cousins. That could be big. Warriors 106-103 Raptors, 56.6, 4th quarter Raptors turn it over. The Warriors have the ball back and it\u2019s still a one-possession game. Not anymore. Curry hits a long three and Thompson hits one on the next Golden State possession and they have the lead! Wow! Warriors 100-103 Raptors, 1:59, 4th quarter The ruling on the court is confirmed. Huge call that. Warriors 100-103 Raptors, 1:59, 4th quarter And an offensive interference call wipes away a DeMarcus Cousins tip-in. They\u2019re going to review it however. Warriors 100-103 Raptors, 2:20, 4th quarter Leonard actually misses out of the timeout, pretty badly. Good defense by the Warriors, but can they get back on offense? They can. Thompson hits a long three pointer. Warriors 97-103 Raptors, 3:05, 4th quarter Warriors are just out of sorts and Leonard is unstoppable now. He hits a pull-up jumper and the Raptors extend the lead. Curry misses yet again, VanVleet gets the rebound. The Raptors slow things down and finally take a timeout. The crowd is as loud as its ever been which feels not scientifically possible. Warriors 97-101 Raptors, 3:54, 4th quarter Curry misses, Leonard hits another shot. Oh no, he\u2019s awake. Draymond cuts the lead back to a single point with a quick basket. Oh and Leonard has hit another three-pointer. The tide feels like its turned Warriors 95-96 Raptors, 5:09, 4th quarter And there goes the lead. Iguodala misses a shot and Leonard hits a super-long three. Email from Thomas Cook: I\u2019m watching from Australia and I follow the Raptors. Would you put Ibaka as the most efficient player these finals ?? There\u2019s a good argument for it, he\u2019s definitely made the most coming out of the bench. Obviously, Kawhi Leonard has been the series MVP so far, but Ibaka will deserve some major props for his contributions. Warriors 95-93 Raptors, 5:36, 4th quarter Norman Powell with a dunk and the Warriors take a timeout. Things feel on the brink for them. In fact, they\u2019ve felt on the brink much of this quarter. Warriors 95-91 Raptors, 6:32, 4th quarter Draymond Green with a three-pointer the Warriors desperately needed. Leonard misses for Toronto and the Warriors get the ball back but Draymond gets called for traveling. Warriors 92-91 Raptors, 6:54, 4th quarter Kevon Looney will not be returning to this game, so the news just keeps getting worse for the Warriors. It doesn\u2019t get much better when the basketball starts up again as Curry gets his shot blocked and, at the other end, Leonard gets a rebound and deposits into the basket to a huge cheer. Now this? This might be a jinx. Email from Jean Wan: I\u2019ve never watched an NBA game in my life, and now that the bandwagon has arrived and I\u2019m watching, I\u2019m cursing the Raptors!! I\u2019m a bad, bad Canadian. Well, don\u2019t speak so soon. It\u2019s just a one possession game now. Warriors 92-89 Raptors, 8:13, 4th quarter Ibaka with a slam! Warriors with a timeout! What a Finals for Ibaka. Warriors 92-87 Raptors, 8:13, 4th quarter Warriors turn it over and Kyle Lowry hits a three-pointer and all the momentum is with Canada at the moment. Never mind Curry just scored, every time they have an answer it seems. Warriors 90-84 Raptors, 9:26, 4th quarter Quinn Cook gets a three-pointer, Lowry hits a jumper on the other end. Hey look it\u2019s Quinn Cook again he finds Jordan Bell (remember him?) for a quick score to respond to the Toronto response. Warriors 85-82 Raptors, 10:11, 4th quarter Normal Powell, who is in the game by the way, finds Ibaka for an alley-oop. On the other end, Cousins misses a three. Ibaka scores again on the other end and it\u2019s a one-possession game again. Warriors 85-78 Raptors, 11:30, 4th quarter Raptors don\u2019t score on their possession. Cousins gets to the line on the other end, he misses the first free throw but finally makes one on his fourth attempt of the game. Email from \u201creneaflunoy67\u201d Subject: Raptors I want them to win it all! Kawhi is a beast! Leonard\u2019s going to have step things up from that third quarter if the Raptors are going to come back to win this one. I have confidence that he will. Warriors 84-78 Raptors, end of the 3rd quarter Ibaka tips in a Siakam shot and Leonard makes one of two free throws. Iguodala just misses on the Warriors end. Raptors walk it back but turn it over on their possession. Draymond Green misses at the end of the third quarter but the Warriors remain in front. Warriors 84-75 Raptors, 1:52, 3rd quarter Warriors have the ball out of the timeout. Green finds Cousins all by himself under the basket and that\u2019s as easy as two-points as you\u2019re going to get for Golden State. How the Warriors are managing to stay in the lead: This sounds like worst case scenario. Warriors 82-75 Raptors, 2:12, 3rd quarter Lowry gets knocked down but completes a layup. Curry misses a wide-open three. When Ibaka loses a ball out of bounds, the Warriors decide that now\u2019s the time for a timeout. Warriors 82-73 Raptors, 2:50, 3rd quarter The three-point shooting is what\u2019s keeping the Warriors ahead despite Toronto\u2019s constant runs. A goal-tend call increases the Warriors lead. Warriors 80-73 Raptors, 3:21, 3rd quarter Thompson misses a three, VanVleet hits a three. Maybe a time for a Warriors timeout? Nope, but Gasol does pick up a non-shooting foul. That\u2019s his fourth. The Warriors turn it over, they need to stop doing that, and Lowry banks one home. That\u2019s a 10 point run\u2026 but Thompson stops it with a three. Warriors 77-68 Raptors, 4:50, 3rd quarter Thompson fouls Gasol. He hits the first of two free throws, as Cousins replace a pained Looney. Gasol then goes ahead and makes the second. He\u2019s up to 16 points. Warriors 77-66 Raptors, 5:19, 3rd quarter Iguodala blocks Lowry\u2019s shot on the release, but Golden State can\u2019t capitalize on offense. On the other end, Lowry gets called on a loose ball foul which puts Looney to the ground. Looney grimaces but stays in the game. Gasol picks up one as well. Looney looks okay at the end of the possession as he scores to increase the Warriors lead. But, hey, VanVleet nails a three-pointer that beats the buzzer for Toronto. Warriors 75-63 Raptors, 7:00, 3rd quarter Well there\u2019s another three-pointer, this time thanks to Iguodala. Thompson scores on a fast break and the Raptors are going to wisely expend a timeout. Out of the break we get the umpteenth \u201cOld Town Road\u201d of the NBA Finals. Warriors 70-63 Raptors, 7:44, 3rd quarter Siakam with a score and foul, he misses the free throw. Doris Burke comes in with another Durant update. He won\u2019t return this game (which was pretty obvious the second the injury happened) and has a \u201clower leg injury\u201d and will have a MRI tomorrow. That\u2019s all we get for now. Curry gets another three-pointer for Golden State, they could use as many of those as possible with Durant gone for good. Warriors 67-61 Raptors, 9:16, 3rd quarter Lowry starts the scoring for the Raptors with a sweet spin move. VanVleet hits a corner three to cut the Warriors lead down some more. Warriors 67-56 Raptors, 10:43, 3rd quarter Iguodala, right by the basket, squeezes through defenders and starts off the second half scoring. VanVleet takes a long three that doesn\u2019t connect. Thompson makes yet another three-pointer on the Warriors end and the lead\u2019s back to double-digits. Warriors 62-56 Raptors, 12:00, 3rd quarter And the second half begins! Let\u2019s see if we\u2019ll have a Game 6 or not. Despite the Warriors lead, that sounds about right. I wonder if there will be any deflation in the Golden State locker room considering the Durant situation. Email from Clare McConnell: I suspect you are an American and have therefore not noticed how biased the refs have been up till the last few minutes. Canadians have to suspect that the no doubt American refs don\u2019t want the trophy to leave the good old US of A I haven\u2019t noticed the refs overtly favoring one team or the other here, to be honest. I will say that the only conspiracy I believe as far as officiating is that they are always for longer playoff series. If there\u2019s any sort of bias it\u2019s not based on basketball patriotism. Instead of going straight to commercial, the broadcast goes to Doris Burke who has an update from the locker room. There\u2019s no official update on Durant, but the report is ominous with everybody giving Durant \u201cspace\u201d to process the injury. It\u2019s really a shame since he clearly did his best to return, possibly before he was really ready, and managed to play quite well to start the game. Also, as the broadcast point out, he is a free agent. And Siakam slices the lead back down to one-point for a handful of seconds. Curry quiets the crowd with a trademark long-distancer. Iggy then tips in a Curry shot to extend the Warriors lead before the end of the first half. Warriors 57-54 Raptors, 1:09, 2nd quarter The Warriors turn the ball over again and Siakam scores and after all that, the Raptors have taken advantage of Golden State\u2019s hiccups and whittled this back down to a one-possession game. Warriors 57-52 Raptors, 1:51, 2nd quarter Iguodala puts Gasol on the line immediately afterwards though, and Gasol goes 2-for-2. Gasol then almost gets a big three-pointer but it just doesn\u2019t come in. On the other end, Thompson gets fouled, that\u2019s the third on Lowry, he makes one of two. And Leonard finds the basket on the other end. Warriors 56-48 Raptors, 3:15, 2nd quarter The Warriors need some points to stabilize this game, so Curry creates contact and gets two free throws which he\u2014of course\u2014nails. Warriors 54-48 Raptors, 3:28, 2nd quarter Cousins draws a foul and gets to the free-throw line. He\u2019s helping the Warriors keep ahead\u2026 except he misses both free throws to the delight of the Raptors crowd. On the other end, Gasol his a three-pointer. Just a disastrous sequence for the Warriors, who know it and call a timeout. Warriors 54-45 Raptors, 4:03, 2nd quarter Cousins tips in a missed Draymond Green three, he\u2019s doing a fantastic job here. Draymond Green then fouls Kyle Lowry, he can\u2019t believe it and he shows no hesitation in complaining. That will mean three free throws for Toronto and he simply can\u2019t be doing that given the circumstances. It\u2019s his sixth technical of the playoffs, which means he\u2019s one away from a suspension. Not that it\u2019ll matter much if the Warriors can\u2019t pull off a win here. Leonard takes and makes the technical. Lowry makes one of two free throws. Warriors 52-43 Raptors, 5:20, 2nd quarter Leonard scores and then gets fouled by Iguodala. He makes both free throws and cuts the Warriors lead into single-digits. Warriors 52-39 Raptors, 6:05, 2nd quarter Leonard with a fantastic block on Thompson! The Warriors still have the ball though. However, Lowry steals the ball clean from Cousins and lays it up on the other end. Curry hits a three on the other end and picks up a foul. He gets the free throw and that\u2019s a four-point play. \u201cAchilles\u201d is trending on Twitter, which is not exactly good news for Kevin Durant although we haven\u2019t heard from actual medical staff, just the doctors on Twitter. Warriors 48-37 Raptors, 7:04, 2nd quarter Boogie is getting down now. This time around, it\u2019s with his passing, he finds Draymond Green for an assist. Toronto takes a timeout. Warriors 46-37 Raptors, 7:26, 2nd quarter And a three-pointer! My stars, this is exactly the lift that the Warriors need here. Siakam, however, puts an end to that Golden State run with a layup. Warriors 43-35 Raptors, 8:42, 2nd quarter Ibaka is on the line, having gotten fouled by Shaun Livingston. He makes one of two free throws. Cousins, coming in the game with Durant out. He makes two straight baskets. Warriors 39-34 Raptors, 9:46, 2nd quarter Lowry makes his first basket of the game. On the next play, Durant hits the floor on the same leg that was injured. That\u2019s just a brutal, brutal turn for the Warriors considering how well he had been playing to start the game. The Raptors fans cheer, which is not a very good look, and the Warriors take a necessary timeout. Warriors 39-32, Raptors 10:12, 2nd quarter Thompson hits the Warriors\u2019 eighth three-pointer and the Warriors are definitely playing Warriors basketball again. It definitely feels like just the availability of Durant has given them a spark as far as confidence. Bogut, as is his wont, fouls Ibaka and puts him on the line. He makes both of his free throws. Warriors 36-30 Raptors, 11:03, 2nd quarter Thompson with a tall jumper to start the scoring in the second. Lowry misses for Toronto but Ibaka gets the rebound and the basket. Warriors 34-28 Raptors, 11:39, 2nd quarter Durant misses the first shot of the second quarter. Andrew Bogut is in rather than DeMarcus Cousins, whose poor play in Game 4 has apparently shifted him deeper onto the bench. You\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s true that the victory will mean more if Durant plays at least one game. Of course, Warriors fans will always say \u201cif only we had KD for the entire series.\u201d Such is the nature of fandom. Warriors 34-28, end of the 1st quarter VanVleet gets two free throws for Toronto. On the other end, Iguodala finds Green for a miss but Curry manages to get the ball for the score. The Raptors can\u2019t get a final shot off and that\u2019ll do it for the first quarter. Warriors 32-26 Raptors, 31.5, 1st quarter Ibaka\u2019s time to foul. He puts Durant on the line where he makes both free throws AND he makes a huge three-pointers. Okay my prediction about his efficiency is not looking so hot. Warriors 27-26 Raptors, 1:56, 1st quarter Leonard gets to line, give the foul to Kevon Looney, he makes one of two free throws. Draymond gets called for a foul next, sort of a ticky-tack call this, he puts the Game 4 hero Serge Ibaka on the line and Ibaka makes it a one-point game. Warriors 27-23 Raptors, 2:45, 1st quarter A foul on Fred VanVleet gives the ball to the Warriors and a wide-open Draymond Green makes the Warriors\u2019 sixth three-pointer. Warriors 24-23 Raptors, 3:33, 1st quarter You\u2019ll never believe this but Curry made his third free throw as well. Durant is back in. Warriors 23-23 Raptors, 3:33, 1st quarter This feels very different than the brick-fest we got last game. After Pascal Siakam scores to briefly give the Raptors the lead, Curry gets fouled on the three-point line. He makes his first two free throws before the Raptors take their first timeout of the game. Warriors 21-21 Raptors, 4:36, 1st quarter Kawhi Leonard has been activated, he gets to the basket and he gets fouled. With the free throw make, he ties up the game. Durant, meanwhile, is out of the game, with Shaun Livingston playing for him. Gasol briefly gives the Raptors a lead but Steph Curry promptly ties it. Warriors 19-16 Raptors, 6:48, 1st quarter Danny Green promptly makes it a one-possession game. Warriors 19-14 Raptors, 6:48, 1st quarter Gasol makes the second of his two free throws out of the timeout. Warriors 19-12 Raptors, 7:11, 1st quarter Thompson fouls Gasol, who picks up his first free throw. With that, the Warriors take their first timeout. Warriors 19-12 Raptors, 7:23, 1st quarter Leonard tips in his own blocked shot to cut down the Warriors lead buy Draymond Green finds Curry for an easy layup. Danny Green scores on the other end. The Warriors can\u2019t miss however, Klay Thompson drills a three-pointer. And Siakam gets his first basket of the night. This is some great offense. Thompson makes the Warriors\u2019 fifth-consecutive three-pointer. Warriors 11-6 Raptors, 9:37, 1st quarter Durant then picks up his first foul, putting Gasol on the line. He makes one of two free throws, but the Raptors handle the rebound and Gasol hits a three pointer. Well that could have gone better for Golden State. And Kevin Durant answers with a three. Well then, maybe there\u2019s no rust. Warriors 8-2 Raptors, 10:02, 1st quarter Curry with a layup. Kevin Durant with a three pointer. Warriors coming out strong. Warriors 3-2 Raptors, 11:08, 1st quarter Raptors get the ball to start things off but get called for travelling. Curry hits a three on the other end for the first scoring play of the game. Gasol scores on the other end as a counter. Warriors 0-0 Raptors, 12:00, 1st quarter And, for the possible final time this season, we\u2019re off!

That\u2019s absolutely appealing to my particular age group. I think she did a remarkable job. As far as \u201cO Canada,\u201d Toronto has brought in Doug Tranquada, the Raptors\u2019 traditional singer, comes in and starts the anthem and the rest of the crowd jumps in to finish it to remarkable effect. Email from Mila Pili: Why do we have to predict? Just watch and see what happens, almost time. This is probably the most sensible approach to watching sports. I, of course, reject the entire concept of watching sports as a reasonable person, but I respect the position. Email from Robbie Mulvena: Greetings from New Zealand Hunter Us Kiwis love our Basketball, and I Am completely Blown away every year at the level of play on display in the NBA, But having been an OKC Fan and going through the heartbreak of losing KD to the warriors who he lost too In the WCF, I can only hope Kawhi and the Raptors disrupt his three peat hopes Toronto Baby! I\u2019m starting to think that the Raptors are the sentimental favorites here. Just maybe. NBA Countdown is on and I\u2019m now reminded that Paul Pierce had the Raptors winning. Now, there\u2019s a good chance that he was completely right. There might be some sort of apocalyptic event coming. Just a head\u2019s up. Okay, I will admit Durant looks pretty okay here. Maybe he\u2019ll prove me wrong. Email from Peter Oh: Hi Hunter, Greetings from California. Full disclosure: I want the Warriors to win. Pet peeve: Toronto\u2019s \u201cWe the North\u201d rallying cry. I get that Canada is to the north of the US, but looking at a world map it\u2019s clear to see that Toronto is in the extreme south of Canada, so \u201cWe the North\u201d is a bit rich, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019d be like a London team facing a Paris team in a final, and the London fans claiming We the North. What would the folks in Liverpool and Newcastle (never mind in Scotland) say?! This is a wonderfully petty reason to root against a team and I am 100% for it. Predictions Alright let\u2019s get this over with. I thought the Warriors would definitely tie this series up in Friday\u2019s Game 4. That, clearly, didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s obvious that without Durant in the lineup, Golden State is just a different team. If the Raptors didn\u2019t go on two long scoring droughts in Game 2, to start the second half and down the stretch in the fourth quarter, this one could already be over. The question is whether or not Durant will have enough to make much of a difference. I don\u2019t think he will, it\u2019s just too much to ask from him after such a long time on the shelf. I think this one\u2019s over and the Raptors manage to pull off a win. Now, I always am hoping for a long, competitive Finals so I hope that I\u2019m wrong here. If you have your own take on tonight, please feel free to send your prediction on how things will go tonight, either via email (the address is hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweet them (to @HunterFelt). Email from Damian Burns: Alright Hunter, on the tarmac at Montreal Airport on a flight to Toronto and onward to Dublin for a family wedding, but with a 3 hour layover from 9pm in Toronto. All seemed perfect, watching the game in Toronto before flying on. Pilot\u2019s just announced we have an hour delay. Gutted. I think this was an Alanis Morissette lyric, which I guess is appropriate since the game is in Canada. Obviously the story of the game is going to be Kevin Durant. According to Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, he looked fine at workouts and they don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a risk: \u201cHe responded well and, yeah, he\u2019s going to play.\u201d He will be starting and will be without a minutes restriction. It\u2019s safe to say Raptors are a little excited about being one victory away from the NBA title. And basketball fever extends far beyond Toronto. Preamble Is this the end of the Warriors dynasty? That\u2019s the question here in Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors. With their Game 4 win at Oracle Arena, the Raptors took a commanding 3-1 lead in the series and now the game returns to Toronto\u2019s Scotiabank Arena for what could be the final game of the NBA season and a symbolic conclusion to the Warriors\u2019 reign as the league\u2019s unstoppable juggernaut. To put things in the starkest terms possible, the Warriors would need to win three straight (starting today) in order to pull off a comeback. which funnily enough means they have to take inspiration from the last team who did that: LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, who pulled off that feat against (you guessed it) the Golden State Warriors in 2016. In the role of James might be Kevin Durant, who has been out for weeks with a calf injury but will attempt to play today. It\u2019s good news for Golden State, but there\u2019s a very real concern about how much they can expect from Durant given that he\u2019s coming back from a serious injury and is immediately being thrown into a literal must-win game. Meanwhile, the Raptors will be battling in front of a home crowd with the perfect opportunity to win their first championship. In fact, they\u2019re playing for an entire country, as no Canadian team has ever won an NBA championship (the Grizzlies didn\u2019t spend enough time in Vancouver to get a decent shot). The beyond stoic Kawhi Leonard, who may be headed towards an entirely different team this offseason, has a chance to finalize a playoff performance of the ages here if the Raptors manage to end this in the next couple of hours. They certainly don\u2019t want to let the Warriors back into the series. The next game would be back at Oracle Arena for a final game in that venue\u2019s history and then would come a Game 7 where anything can happen. So, shortly we will get be celebrating a Raptors championship or the start of a memorable Warriors comeback. That sounds like it will be fun no matter. If you want to contribute to the liveblog feel free to send your thoughts here either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet them here (to @HunterFelt) and we\u2019ll include them along the way. We will have Opening Tip some time after 9:00pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back well before then. It\u2019s Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors at Scotiabank Arena! Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how Toronto has been handling the NBA finals: When Fitriya Hussein was given free tickets to a Toronto Raptorsbasketball game years ago in middle school, she was drawn in by the intensity of play; the strategy, speed and excitement. She instantly became a fan. But with that mantle came years of heartbreak, disappointment and frustration that sports fans around the world know all too well. Now, after Friday\u2019s victory over the reigning champion Golden State Warriors in the NBA finals, the Raptors are a single win away from their first-ever championship. And basketball fans in Toronto are experiencing a feeling that has been absent for more than two decades: hope. You can read the full report below:",

      "body": "<p>For the first four games of the NBA finals, the question lingered: would Kevin Durant play? The two-time NBA finals MVP had not played since suffering a calf strain in Game 5 of the Western Conference semi-finals. The Warriors were dogged by questions about whether they could claim their third NBA championship in a row without him.</p> \n<p>The short answer is that the Warriors are still capable of doing just that, after a thrilling 106-105 win over the Toronto Raptors in Game 5. Even as chants of \u201cKD sucks\u201d rained down from the seats of Scotiabank Arena, Durant showed what he is capable of, making his first two three-point attempts with ease. The Warriors followed Durant\u2019s lead, going five-for-five from beyond the arc to start the game, making life difficult for the Raptors.</p> \n<p>But it was not to last. Durant limped out of the game midway through the second-quarter and the Warriors general manager, Bob Myers, later confirmed the 30-year-old had sustained an achilles injury. If that is true, his series is almost certainly over.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwPSVim3hAs\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UwPSVim3hAs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anybody to blame,\u201d Myers, who had cleared Durant to play in the game, said. \u201cBut I understand this world. If there\u2019s anybody to blame, blame me.\u201d Myers said Durant will have an MRI on Tuesday to assess the extent of his injury.</p> \n<p>Durant, for his part, put on a brave face. \u201cI\u2019m hurting deep in the soul right now I can\u2019t lie,\u201d Durant wrote on Instagram after the game. \u201cBut seeing my brothers get this win was like taking a shot of tequila, I got a new life.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jun/10/nba-finals-game-5-golden-state-warriors-toronto-raptors-live-score\">Golden State Warriors 106-105 Toronto Raptors: NBA finals Game 5 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Durant left the court to classless cheers from the Toronto crowd. If anything those cheers inspired the Warriors: they promptly went on a 12-5 run and went into half-time with a 62-56 lead. The Raptors slowly clawed back that lead in the second half, and late in the game it appeared their star player, Kawhi Leonard, had secured the win that would land them the title. He went on a 10-0 run and the Raptors had a six-point lead with just over three minutes remaining. But even without Durant, the Warriors still have Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. The Splash Brothers hit three straight three-pointers to give the Warriors a one-point lead with under a minute to go.

      "bodyText": "For the first four games of the NBA finals, the question lingered: would Kevin Durant play? The two-time NBA finals MVP had not played since suffering a calf strain in Game 5 of the Western Conference semi-finals. The Warriors were dogged by questions about whether they could claim their third NBA championship in a row without him. The short answer is that the Warriors are still capable of doing just that, after a thrilling 106-105 win over the Toronto Raptors in Game 5. Even as chants of \u201cKD sucks\u201d rained down from the seats of Scotiabank Arena, Durant showed what he is capable of, making his first two three-point attempts with ease. The Warriors followed Durant\u2019s lead, going five-for-five from beyond the arc to start the game, making life difficult for the Raptors. But it was not to last. Durant limped out of the game midway through the second-quarter and the Warriors general manager, Bob Myers, later confirmed the 30-year-old had sustained an achilles injury. If that is true, his series is almost certainly over. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anybody to blame,\u201d Myers, who had cleared Durant to play in the game, said. \u201cBut I understand this world. If there\u2019s anybody to blame, blame me.\u201d Myers said Durant will have an MRI on Tuesday to assess the extent of his injury. Durant, for his part, put on a brave face. \u201cI\u2019m hurting deep in the soul right now I can\u2019t lie,\u201d Durant wrote on Instagram after the game. \u201cBut seeing my brothers get this win was like taking a shot of tequila, I got a new life.\u201d Durant left the court to classless cheers from the Toronto crowd. If anything those cheers inspired the Warriors: they promptly went on a 12-5 run and went into half-time with a 62-56 lead. The Raptors slowly clawed back that lead in the second half, and late in the game it appeared their star player, Kawhi Leonard, had secured the win that would land them the title. He went on a 10-0 run and the Raptors had a six-point lead with just over three minutes remaining. But even without Durant, the Warriors still have Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. The Splash Brothers hit three straight three-pointers to give the Warriors a one-point lead with under a minute to go. Toronto had a chance to win it at the buzzer, but Kyle Lowry missed his chance. \u201cThey\u2019re amazing. They\u2019re amazing competitors, great shooters,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of Curry and Thompson after the game. It was perhaps no surprise that Lowry missed: the Raptors had shot poorly all night. To have any chance of beating the Warriors, they will need to improve on their 25% shooting from three-point range here. Leonard led the Raptors with 26 points, but Pascal Siakam, Danny Green and Lowry went a combined one-for-14 from three-point range. The Warriors, meanwhile, shot 47.6% from three-point range, and relied heavily on an exhausted-looking, but still dogged performance from Curry. He led the Warriors with 31 points. Thompson scored 26. \u201cWe had a chance to win a championship tonight and we didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Raptors guard Fred VanVleet said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well enough, we didn\u2019t execute enough down the stretch and that stings a little bit.\u201d Though this Warriors team hasn\u2019t shown it for the majority of this series, Game 5 served as yet another reminder: that they are not a good team, but a great one.

More than 100 people were killed and as many as 700 injured in the attack last Monday on a sit-in and clashes afterwards, as paramilitaries from the Rapid Support Forces spread through the city to quell sporadic unrest. Harrowing details of rapes by the RSF have emerged in recent days despite restrictions on communications in Sudan, but the extent of the sexual violence has remained unknown. One doctor with access to data compiled by the central committee of doctors, a pro-reform group, said hospitals in Khartoum had recorded more than 70 cases of rape in the attack and its immediate aftermath. A doctor at the Royal Care hospital said it had treated eight victims of rape \u2013 five women and three men. At a second hospital in the south of Khartoum, a medical source said it had received two rape cases, including one who was attacked by four RSF paramilitaries. Several witnesses have also described similar cases on social media. Many victims have not sought medical treatment, either because of fear of reprisals, insecurity in the city, or because care has been limited. Human rights activists and experts have described the reports of sexual violence as reliable. The crisis in Sudan continued on Monday with the second day of a general strike aimed at relaunching an opposition movement battered by a brutal crackdown, and forcing the country\u2019s military leaders to resign. Shops were closed and streets were empty throughout Khartoum and in the neighbouring city of Omdurman, though there was visibly more traffic in the streets than on Sunday, when the strike began. Four protesters were killed in sporadic violence in the two cities over the weekend. A top US diplomat will head to the country this week to urge an end to the crackdown. Tibor Nagy, the US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, plans to meet both members of the military leadership and protest leaders in Khartoum. Sudan\u2019s military leaders have refused to make any concessions since the start of the strike, blaming the country\u2019s protest movement for what they describe as a major threat to the nation and its security. Lt Gen Jamaleddine Omar, from the ruling transitional military council, said late on Sunday that by closing roads and setting up barricades, the protesters had committed a crime. \u201cThe technique of closing the roads and building barricades \u2026 is a fully-fledged crime as it deprives people from being able to go about their normal life,\u201d he said. Omar said the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change, a coalition of pro-democracy groups, was to blame for \u201call the regrettable events\u201d of the past days. The protest leaders, by their actions, have \u201ccrossed the line of peaceful practices \u2026 and have become a major liability for the country and the people\u2019s security,\u201d he said. Omar also said the military and the RSF had reinforced their presence across the country \u201cto restore life back to normal\u201d. The military took power after ousting the then president, Omar al-Bashir, in April after months of mass rallies. The ruling council has since refused demonstrators\u2019 demands for an immediate move to civilian rule, instead pushing for a transitional power-sharing arrangement. Talks between the opposition and the council ground to a halt last month then collapsed altogether after the raid on the protest camp. The Sudanese Professionals Association, an umbrella group of unions that has been spearheading protests since December, urged the Sudanese to continue the general strike, part of a civil disobedience campaign to press the military. The SPA posted videos and photos on social media it said showed deserted streets and closed shops and businesses in Khartoum\u2019s Gabra neighbourhood and the eastern city of Wad Madani. According to the protest leaders, participation in the strike on the first day exceeded their hopes. They vowed on Monday to continue their \u201cpeaceful resistance\u201d until the military council was toppled. The SPA urged people to close roads again, rebuild dismantled barricades across the country and avoid clashes with the RSF. Security forces on Sunday removed barricades from main roads and ended the sit-in area outside the military\u2019s headquarters. \u201cThe solution is to get life paralysed,\u201d the protest leaders said. Activists say professionals including bankers, doctors, air-traffic control staff, pilots, electrical engineers and economists have been targeted by intelligence services in what they say is an obvious attempt to break the strike. The internet remains cut off in Khartoum, with other communications significantly restricted.",

Highways England said it was assessing the \u201cserious road defect\u201d and the M25 would remain closed on Tuesday morning. Highways England advised motorists to follow diversions. Amber weather alerts were issued on Monday warning of flooding, transport disruption and a potential risk to life and property across the south-east overnight amid forecasts predicting a month of rain would fall in days.

June is usually the third driest month of the year, and the current weather stands in contrast to June 2018 where many stations saw less than 2mm.

Flooding of property is expected imminently. \u201cPlease take action. Further thunderstorms are forecast over the next six hours. \u201cWe expect river levels to remain high until around 10pm on Monday evening.\u201d Residents are being told to plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers which may be flooded. A further six flood alerts warned people to prepare for potential flooding in parts of south London, Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire and Devon.

The short answer is yes.</p> <p>Thankfully, there are still reliable ways to preserve your anonymity and to keep material confidential. The Guardian takes great care to protect its sources from the threat of reprisal and permanently keeps open secure channels of communication.</p> <p>Whistleblowers should also take great care themselves to understand the legal protections available under current law.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/11/australias-press-freedom-needs-better-protection-heres-where-to-start\">Australia's press freedom needs better protection. Here\u2019s where to start | Rebecca Ananian-Welsh</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How can I keep my communications with reporters away from prying eyes?</h2> <p>Maintaining a secure, confidential line of communication, from beginning to end, is critical to protecting the identity of whistleblowers. Generally speaking, that means not using regular phone calls, texts or unencrypted emails, and avoiding the use of devices that could be under surveillance.</p> <p>The Guardian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/ng-interactive/2017/mar/17/contact-the-guardian-securely\">published an exhaustive guide highlighting</a> the best options for whistleblowers wanting to protect their anonymity and the confidentiality of material.</p> <p>Of these options, SecureDrop is by far the best. It allows whistleblowers to communicate and share documents without being tracked, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop\">though only a small number of outlets, including the Guardian</a>, make it available. SecureDrop makes no record of where material has come from, ensuring anonymity is preserved. It automatically encrypts documents, making it difficult for outside eyes to view the material. The Guardian will only ever access SecureDrop material from computers that are offline, lessening any risk of anonymity being compromised from this end. All the Guardian sees through SecureDrop is the shared material and a codename allowing replies to be sent to the whistleblower. Whistleblowers will need to find a computer that is not being watched, download the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">TOR internet browser</a>, and go to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop\">https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop</a> for next steps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/ng-interactive/2017/mar/17/contact-the-guardian-securely\">Contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If SecureDrop is not possible, encrypted email is another way to prevent outsiders monitoring your communications with the media. Creating a new email account and setting up PGP encryption, if done properly, will maintain confidentiality. But the process requires some technical know-how. Users need a PGP tool (<a href=\"https://www.mailvelope.com/en\">Mailvelope</a> is popular), the public key of the journalist they wish to contact, the TOR browser and a newly created email address.</p> <p>If you\u2019re finding PGP difficult, ProtonMail is a <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/security-details\">secure, easy-to-use email service</a>. ProtonMail is end-to-end encrypted but is as simple as most major email services, like Gmail. ProtonMail aims to eliminate any chance of your message being intercepted. Emails are stored on its servers in an encrypted format, and are transmitted between ProtonMail servers and devices in a similarly encrypted fashion. ProtonMail is set up in a way that makes your data inaccessible even to the company itself. </p> <p>End-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Threema are also a good way to keep material confidential. The apps are as simple to use as text messaging, but keep the content of messages hidden from anyone but the sender and recipient. The apps, however, are not great for ensuring anonymity. Signal, for example, will generally display phone numbers. Using a temporary burner phone can help avoid this problem, if anonymity is critical.</p> <p>Regular snail mail can otherwise help to ensure whistleblowers leave no digital trace. It\u2019s generally unlikely mail will be intercepted, unless scans detect dangerous objects. But a risk remains that the sender\u2019s location can be traced, either by identifying where the item was mailed from, or through the packaging.

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s federal police raids sent a clear and unambiguous message to would-be whistleblowers. Revealing government wrongdoing can be a dangerous game. But, as the Transparency International Australia chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, notes, whistleblowing remains critical to the functioning of a healthy democracy. \u201cA healthy democracy depends on the ability to hold decision-makers to account, and for that we need transparency,\u201d she said. \u201cThe media and whistleblowers play a crucial role in shining a light on what our government does in our name.\u201d So is it still possible for whistleblowers to make revelations of government wrongdoing without repercussion? The short answer is yes. Thankfully, there are still reliable ways to preserve your anonymity and to keep material confidential. The Guardian takes great care to protect its sources from the threat of reprisal and permanently keeps open secure channels of communication. Whistleblowers should also take great care themselves to understand the legal protections available under current law. How can I keep my communications with reporters away from prying eyes? Maintaining a secure, confidential line of communication, from beginning to end, is critical to protecting the identity of whistleblowers. Generally speaking, that means not using regular phone calls, texts or unencrypted emails, and avoiding the use of devices that could be under surveillance. The Guardian has published an exhaustive guide highlighting the best options for whistleblowers wanting to protect their anonymity and the confidentiality of material. Of these options, SecureDrop is by far the best. It allows whistleblowers to communicate and share documents without being tracked, though only a small number of outlets, including the Guardian, make it available. SecureDrop makes no record of where material has come from, ensuring anonymity is preserved. It automatically encrypts documents, making it difficult for outside eyes to view the material. The Guardian will only ever access SecureDrop material from computers that are offline, lessening any risk of anonymity being compromised from this end. All the Guardian sees through SecureDrop is the shared material and a codename allowing replies to be sent to the whistleblower. Whistleblowers will need to find a computer that is not being watched, download the TOR internet browser, and go to https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop for next steps. If SecureDrop is not possible, encrypted email is another way to prevent outsiders monitoring your communications with the media. Creating a new email account and setting up PGP encryption, if done properly, will maintain confidentiality. But the process requires some technical know-how. Users need a PGP tool (Mailvelope is popular), the public key of the journalist they wish to contact, the TOR browser and a newly created email address. If you\u2019re finding PGP difficult, ProtonMail is a secure, easy-to-use email service. ProtonMail is end-to-end encrypted but is as simple as most major email services, like Gmail. ProtonMail aims to eliminate any chance of your message being intercepted. Emails are stored on its servers in an encrypted format, and are transmitted between ProtonMail servers and devices in a similarly encrypted fashion. ProtonMail is set up in a way that makes your data inaccessible even to the company itself. End-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Threema are also a good way to keep material confidential. The apps are as simple to use as text messaging, but keep the content of messages hidden from anyone but the sender and recipient. The apps, however, are not great for ensuring anonymity. Signal, for example, will generally display phone numbers. Using a temporary burner phone can help avoid this problem, if anonymity is critical. Regular snail mail can otherwise help to ensure whistleblowers leave no digital trace. It\u2019s generally unlikely mail will be intercepted, unless scans detect dangerous objects. But a risk remains that the sender\u2019s location can be traced, either by identifying where the item was mailed from, or through the packaging. There is also the risk of items being lost or delayed in the mail. People keep talking about the government\u2019s new national security powers. How do they threaten my ability to talk to journalists? Three things are relevant here: metadata retention laws, new powers designed to circumvent encryption and new secrecy offences. The metadata laws introduced by the Abbott government allow the government to obtain warrantless access to information about a person\u2019s communications. They apply to phone calls, texts, emails and internet activity. Metadata refers to basic information about a particular communication, not the actual content of the information itself. For a call, that might be the time of the call, the number dialled and the call\u2019s duration. The law requires telcos to store such metadata for at least two years. The risk here is obvious.

Also last year, the government passed new espionage offences making it a crime punishable by seven years imprisonment for a current or former public servant to communicate information that \u201cis likely to cause harm to Australia\u2019s interests\u201d. A second offence, punishable by five years behind bars, exists barring public servants from \u201ccommunicating and dealing with information by non-commonwealth officers\u201d.

The protections \u2013 contained in the corporations act 2001 \u2013 made it hard for corporate whistleblowers to speak to the media, even if the company and corporate regulator failed to act. But parliament this year passed new reforms to significantly strengthen corporate whistleblowing protections. Whistleblowers can now go to a journalist or parliamentarian to make \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201cpublic interest\u201d disclosures once 90 days has passed since they last blew the whistle, either internally or to a regulator. A broader range of people can obtain such protection, including the family of current or former employees. Previously, protections were only available for revealing conduct that breached the corporations act. Now protection can be obtained for disclosing a much wider range of misconduct, including fraud, bribery, corporate corruption and money laundering. In some respects, Australia\u2019s corporate whistleblowing regime will be world-leading.

The fight proceeds as players of the original will remember, but the new battle system really shows its stuff, suggesting that the promises of real tactical action might be justified. That\u2019ll be a relief for those who played Final Fantasy XV\u2019s superficially similar battle system and found themselves mostly button-mashing their way through battles.</p> <p>Where the original fight with the scorpion had a famously dodgy translation that read as a command to \u201cattack while the tail is up\u201d, rather than the warning it was supposed to be, the new version has a different command: take cover behind debris before it fires off its main attack. Positioning your characters isn\u2019t just for show, as it was in Square Enix\u2019s Dragon Quest XI, then.</p> <p>Finally, after first destroying one leg of the Scorpion, Cloud and Barrat take out the boss completely. It plunges off the gantry, to deafening cheers from the crowd.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfefef78f0863265fe97606\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T01:08:47.727Z\">2.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For those who want to avoid menus, \u201cabilities and spells can be bound to shortcuts for immediate action\u201d, but the ATB sticks around regardless.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfefe408f0880dcae93c26c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T01:08:03.685Z\">2.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Square Enix\u2019s Neal Pabon takes the stage to introduce the first ever look at gameplay in the remake.</p> <p>\u201cReal-time action merged with strategic combat\u201d is the claim.

And, while the ten minute hands-on didn\u2019t provide much of a look at the depth of the relationships between the cast, it did show the tone and feel, which is, well, cozy. There may be drama later in the plot, but one gets the sense that if Spiritfarer leaves you feeling anything but warm and fuzzy, the developers will be trying to work out what went wrong.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfef87e8f0863265fe975eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T00:41:42.509Z\">1.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While we wait for Square Enix to start its conference, I\u2019ll run you through a few smaller games on show at the convention that might not have hit headlines, but deserve some attention nonetheless.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfef7588f081a8ed1bb0931\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-11T00:39:16.900Z\">1.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Alex Hern here, signing on from Los Angeles and warming up my typing fingers for the Square Enix press conference which starts in just twenty minutes time.</p> <p>We\u2019ve already had some pretty major news from the company: a release date for the Final Fantasy VII Remake \u2013 and one much closer than anyone expected.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it for us! E3 proper begins tomorrow, but it feels a lot of the biggest announcements have already been made. Final Fantasy VII Remake, Watch Dogs: Brexit Edition and Marvel\u2019s Avengers. A big day for gaming. Surprise! It\u2019s a live game, a la Destiny or The Division. Avengers delivers \u201ca narrative over multiple years, with exciting new content released on a regular basis.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll assemble into teams of up to four players online, where you can master exciting abilities and muster a roster of exciting heroes. Every new hero, every new region will be delivered at no cost\u201d And there won\u2019t be random lootboxes or pay to win either. Another trailer reveals the game\u2019s interpretation of Hank Pym, Ant Man, before the release date: Out worldwide on PS4, Xbox One, Stadia and PC, with some platform exclusives for Playstation\u2026 on May 15, 2020. The team emphasises that the game is \u201cCrystal Dynamics own interpretation of Avengers\u201d, explaining why the likes of Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr are missing, but it does make it all the odder that the character design is lifted straight from the movies. The Tomb Raider developer has big shoes to step into. A bit more detail: the story begins five years after the team was forced to disband following that inciting incident. \u201cIt\u2019s about losing what matters to you most, and fighting to get it back.\u201d \u201cThis is a story about self-acceptance in the face of adversity\u2026 and learning that together we are mighty.\u201d But the biggest title is saved for last: Crystal Dynamics\u2019 Avengers. It\u2019ll take some getting used to for fans of the movies, since the game doesn\u2019t have the likenesses of any of the actors in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the game looks like it does a good job of providing playable interpretations of all the big five: Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Black Widow are all shown as playable characters, with the action switching between them as they try, and fail, to prevent a mysterious villain from taking down a Helicarrier. And that\u2019s not the only thing lost in the inciting incident: the game appears to take place largely following the apparent death of Captain America. SURPRISE: There is a Final Fantasy VIII rerelease coming. The game had been thought lost, with rumours that the original source code had been deleted, and only the PC version remained. But clearly someone has managed: it\u2019s coming out this year. Oninaki is a new RPG from the skunkworks team at Square Enix who made retro-styled RPG I Am Setsuna. It\u2019s out August 22 this year. We\u2019re all waiting for Avengers, but first, an introduction for Outriders, a new postapocalyptic co-op shooter from the makers of Bulletstorm. Coming 2020, the all-FMV trailer doesn\u2019t reveal much about the game, but hopefully Sebastian Wojciechowski, the head of Polish developers People Can Fly, can tell us a bit more. He introduces a video that describes the game as \u201ca dark modern shooter with traditional values. We are creating an experience with a strong story that you can enjoy with your friends and on your own.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cone, two or three-player drop-in, drop-out co-op shooter\u201d, more prosaically. Now, an announcement of a new mobile game to live \u201calongside\u201d Final Fantasy Brave Exvius. War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius has a mouthful of a name, and appears to tell a fairly sweeping Game of Thrones-esque story of a warring nation. As for actual gameplay, it looks to call back to the much loved Final Fantasy Tactics series \u2013 a step up from the fairly basic play of FFBV. A new trailer next for the postapocalyptic parkour zombie-escape sim Dying Light 2, already announced for Spring 2020, and a surprise announcement of a pair of rereleases of retro JRPGs that never made it to the west: SaGa Scarlett Grace, and Romancing SaGa 3. This trailer is apparently extremely exciting if you\u2019re a Final Fantasy XIV player but I have almost no idea what is going on. It\u2019s sparkly, though! Naoki Yoshida, producer of Final Fantasy XIV, the popular MMO, arrives to demo the game\u2019s third expansion pack Shadowbringers, debuting July 2nd. The game now has 16 million registered users, a remarkable turnaround after a launch so disastrous that the entire game was torn down, and the in-game world literally destroyed, before being relaunched as A Realm Reborn in 2013. The expansion pack includes two new jobs, and two new playable races, and a new story \u201croughly equal in size to a standalone singleplayer RPG\u201d. And now the trailer for a game that everyone knew would be coming: the first expansion to Kingdom Hearts 3, the mega-collaboration with Disney. That game ended with a bizarre conversation between two characters from its famously convoluted backstory, that had barely any relationship to the main plot. Well, now we see what it means: coming this winter, the Re-Minds DLC will (might) answer some questions. A trailer round-up for Square Enix\u2019s indie label, Collective, introduces us to the titles coming in 2020. Circuit Superstars, a racing game from Mexico \u201cmixes top down racing with a classic sharp arcade look\u201d. It looks like a loving homage to Micro Machines and the like, and features online multiplayer \u2013 of course. Coming to PC, PS4, Xbox One and Switch. Battalion 1944 is a throwback competitive multiplayer shooter, for those who think Counter-Strike is too dumbed-down. It\u2019s also already out, so I\u2019m not entirely clear what\u2019s 2020 about this. More Dragon Quest! Coming to Switch is the formerly-exclusive-to-PS4 Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. The game, now branded the Definitive Edition S, will feature a new 2D mode, letting players experience the entire adventure as though it was a SNES game from 1993. And it\u2019s out this autumn. A trailer for Dragon Quest Builders 2 comes next. This Minecraft-like sequel merges, well, (dragon) questing and (mine) crafting, and now farming too. And the game supports four-player online co-op, so you can enlist your friends as willing labourers. Out July 12th, with a demo arriving on the Playstation store in late June. The remasters keep coming: the 2008 Xbox 360 RPG Last Remnant is coming out on Switch \u2013 today. The game was fairly well received back in the day, when it was seen as the last attempt by Microsoft to break the Japanese market. And then we get a release date for another remake: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, coming to smartphones with online co-op. The original, a Gamecube exclusive, never got the attention it deserved, with a proto-Wii U approach requiring each individual player to use a Gameboy Advance to manage their action. The immediately after that, the announcement that last year\u2019s throwback Switch exclusive RPG, Octopath Traveller, is coming to PC. And we\u2019re done with Final Fantasy. Next up, a trailer Life is Strange 2, with the sequel to the award winning 2015 adventure game announced as Playable Today. Finally, we see another new trailer for the game. Scenes like Cloud\u2019s motorcycle escape from Midgar, his first meeting with Aerith \u2013 and a first look at the remade Tifa. Again, my ears hurt from the volume of the cheers. And then, to cap off the trailer, the first appearance of Sephiroth, the game\u2019s antagonist. Available worldwide, March 3 2020, exclusive to PS4. A \u201c1st Class Edition\u201d, featuring a statue of Cloud on a motorbike, prompts a cry of \u201ctake my wallet\u201d from the crowd. Trailer over, Tetsuya Nomura, the game\u2019s director, takes to the stage as well. With the interpreter making four, it\u2019s getting crowded up there. \u201cIt has been a while since we\u2019ve had Nomura work so heavily on a project like this,\u201d Kitase says, \u201cso it\u2019s good to see him work with the same passion he had 22 years ago.\u201d Nomura adds, alongside Kitase, his gratitude for those who\u2019ve been \u201csupporting us so patiently,\u201d before revealing a bombshell: the game will be playable at the Square Enix booth during E3. It shouldn\u2019t be that surprising, since we already knew the game was coming in just nine months, but still \u2014 this is a moment many thought would never come. And we launch into a new excerpt to finish the first section: the Scorpion Sentinel, the game\u2019s first boss. The fight proceeds as players of the original will remember, but the new battle system really shows its stuff, suggesting that the promises of real tactical action might be justified. That\u2019ll be a relief for those who played Final Fantasy XV\u2019s superficially similar battle system and found themselves mostly button-mashing their way through battles. Where the original fight with the scorpion had a famously dodgy translation that read as a command to \u201cattack while the tail is up\u201d, rather than the warning it was supposed to be, the new version has a different command: take cover behind debris before it fires off its main attack. Positioning your characters isn\u2019t just for show, as it was in Square Enix\u2019s Dragon Quest XI, then. Finally, after first destroying one leg of the Scorpion, Cloud and Barrat take out the boss completely. It plunges off the gantry, to deafening cheers from the crowd. For those who want to avoid menus, \u201cabilities and spells can be bound to shortcuts for immediate action\u201d, but the ATB sticks around regardless. Square Enix\u2019s Neal Pabon takes the stage to introduce the first ever look at gameplay in the remake. \u201cReal-time action merged with strategic combat\u201d is the claim. Tapping the square button will let Cloud hit enemies with his normal attacks, but it will also fill up an ATB bar \u2013 when that fills up, the game enters Tactical mode, where players can cast spells and use special abilities. You don\u2019t just play as Cloud: a single button press switches to Barret, Cloud\u2019s gun-handed ally, and Pabon teases that we\u2019ll see Tifa Lockhart \u201csoon\u201d. \u201cTo our long-time fans, we thank you for your support and patience over these years,\u201d Kitase says. I don\u2019t speak Japanese well enough to know whether he emphasised \u201cpatience\u201d there. \u201cRemaking Final Fantasy VII has allowed us to dive much deeper into the world and its titles than ever before. \u201cWe anticipate two blu-ray discs full of gameplay content,\u201d he adds, to cheers from the crowd. One of the discs will go further into the history of the world of Final Fantasy VII, suggesting the game has swelled from a remake to a near sequel. A suitably dramatic beginning: the curtain rises to reveal the game-over screen of Final Fantasy VII: NEW GAME or Continue? Another option fades into view: Remake? The crowd laps it up, of course, and we get a brief clip of the same trailer we saw last month, before Yoshinori Kitase, the game\u2019s producer, takes the stage. But enough of the Indie games. The countdown on stage has hit 10 seconds. Time to go. Undermine PC, Xbox One, Switch. Release date: Early access in Summer 2019 A pixelated action-adventure roguelike, Undermine\u2019s two-person team has created a game that blends the procedurally-generated rooms of Binding of Isaac with the aesthetics of Spelunky and the hot mining action of Stardew Valley. Each run sees you playing as a new peasant, tasked by a wizard to explore the caverns below your village in order to work out what is causing the dangerous earthquakes that shake your home. Each run will see you die, frequently fairly quickly, but still cart back enough resources to improve your next characters, powering up you pickaxes, boots and armour to endure more challenging tasks. The game will feel familiar to roguelike fans \u2013 perhaps too familiar, if what you\u2019re looking for is a whole new experience. But it has polish, and when it launches in early access on Steam this summer, expect it to pick up a following. Spiritfarer Xbox One, PS4, Switch, PC. Release date: Early 2020 This indie game, styled as \u201ca cozy management game about dying\u201d, was given a fairly hefty slot at Microsoft\u2019s presser. It sees you playing as Stella, ferrymaster to the deceased, as she sails the sea of the dead, carting spirits to the beyond. That\u2019s the \u201cdying\u201d part \u2013 but it\u2019s the \u201ccozy management game\u201d that caught the eye of many. The management part is the bulk of the gameplay: It tasks Stella with building vertically on her boat, to provide abodes for choosy spirits, land for growing crops on, kitchens for cooking meals in and, presumably, more besides. She can fish, farm and literally bottle lightning in order to gather the needed resources. And then there\u2019s the cozy. With its animated 2D look, Spiritfarer has charm in bucketloads. And, while the ten minute hands-on didn\u2019t provide much of a look at the depth of the relationships between the cast, it did show the tone and feel, which is, well, cozy. There may be drama later in the plot, but one gets the sense that if Spiritfarer leaves you feeling anything but warm and fuzzy, the developers will be trying to work out what went wrong. While we wait for Square Enix to start its conference, I\u2019ll run you through a few smaller games on show at the convention that might not have hit headlines, but deserve some attention nonetheless. Alex Hern here, signing on from Los Angeles and warming up my typing fingers for the Square Enix press conference which starts in just twenty minutes time. We\u2019ve already had some pretty major news from the company: a release date for the Final Fantasy VII Remake \u2013 and one much closer than anyone expected. During a concert of video game music last night, Square Enix announced that the long-awaited recreation of the PlayStation game will be arriving on March 3, 2020. Until then: here\u2019s all the E3 news so far in one convenient round-up. Okay, that\u2019s me signing off. Technology editor Alex Hern will be back for all the Square Enix news at 6:00 PM PT / 2:00 AM BST. If either the Avengers or Final Fantasy float your boat, don\u2019t miss it. Watch Dogs Legion, set in post-Brexit London and directed by Far Cry 2\u2019s Clint Hocking, looks like an impressive next step for open-world games, letting you take control of anyone in the whole futuristic city to build a resistance against the tech-drive dystopia that the capital has become. It\u2019ll be out March 6th, 2020. The next Rainbow Six game, Quarantine, will be a 3-player co-operative shooter where the enemy is a scary and little-understood pandemic Ghost Recon Breakpoint is out on October 4th, with a beta going live September 5th New modes and updates were shown for established Ubisoft games Rainbow Six Siege, For Honor and The Division 2 Another new game was announced from the creators of Assassin\u2019s Creed: Gods and Monsters, centred on mythology rather than history Roller Champions is a new team sports game with a Dreamworks-esque look and feel - a downloadable demo is available now Ubisoft is joining the race to be the Netflix of Gaming with uPlay+, a $14.99 subscription service offering access to 100+ old games and new. It\u2019ll be partnering with Google Stadia to deliver it That\u2019s it for the announcements. What an impressively broad selection of games that was. It\u2019s a beautiful-looking game, this, heavily influenced by Breath of the Wild on first appearances, and by Greek mythology. It\u2019s out February 25 2020. He\u2019s announcing a new project from Quebec. Assassin\u2019s Creed producer Marc-Alexis Cote is here to show it off: \u201cfor years our minds have lingered on a different aspect of our history: mythology.\u201d Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is here to close things out, thanking the developers for their hard work. \u201cAt Ubisoft it is our intention to create games that make you stronger and happier in your life... we hope you will spend quality time with family and friends and meet new inspiring people, learn more about yourself by doing, and gain new perspective on the world, to help shape it.\u201d Do you wanna watch some people dancing? Here\u2019s that 10 years of Just Dance video from earlier, if you need a little joy boost. It\u2019s called Roller Champions, a team-based sports game, and an alpha demo is available to play today. Love a good surprise release. Looks like it\u2019s time to learn about Ubisoft\u2019s roller derby multiplayer game now. The trailer looks very cool, with Overwatch-style animated art. Haha, it\u2019s as if someone out there heard me. uPlay Plus will be partnering with Google\u2019s Stadia streaming service from 2020. See, the thing about this rush to be the Netflix of gaming is that THERE ARE NOT 14 DIFFERENT NETFLIXES, and that\u2019s why Netflix did so well: it got there first and did it properly. There\u2019s going to have to be some consolidation soon, because game companies cannot expect us to have 5 different $15 subscriptions going at any one time. It\u2019ll be $14.99 a month and will launch in September. Ah, it looks like Ubisoft has joined the subscription-service bandwagon. uPlay Plus is a PC service that will give you early access to new games and 100+ old ones from Ubi\u2019s catalogue for your money. Oh good, Ubisoft has been working on a movie! Video game movies always work out. The Division movie will be coming out on Netflix and stars Jake Gyllenhaal. Ah, it\u2019s just into the surrounding woodlands. And the zoo. And, later this year, the Pentagon. Here\u2019s a trailer. Time to learn what\u2019s next for The Division 2, the totally-not-political military squad-shooter set in a devastated Washington DC. It\u2019ll be playable for free between June 13th and 16th, if you want to try it out. The first expansion will allow players out of Washington and into the rest of the US, it seems. The enemy is an unknown and devastating parasite. Here\u2019s a teaser trailer. \u201cWhat Siege is to the PvP shooter, Quarantine will be to PvE co-op, testing your tactical skills and survival instincts.\u201d A tense trailer now for a horror/zombie-themed 3-player co-operative Rainbow Six game: Quarantine. A supernatural-themed update is coming to Ubisoft\u2019s bone-crunching melee-weapon combat game For Honor. That\u2019s available to play now if big axes and possessed fighters sound appealing. There will be new Just Dance in November. Until that footage is up, here\u2019s a trailer for the Tom Clancy mobile game. Hooray for the annual Ubisoft dance-off. The panda is back and everything. Who cares about that though when we\u2019ve got new Just Dance! It\u2019s been ten years since this world-beating dance game first appeared and it\u2019s one of the most successful game franchises of all time. (This will only come as a surprise if you\u2019ve never busted it out at a kids\u2019 birthday party.) Ah, but we\u2019re not leaving Tom Clancy behind just yet: here\u2019s a smartphone squad combat game, Tom Clancy\u2019s EliteSquad. Before we leave Ghost Recon behind, here\u2019s a gameplay trailer. Ghost Recon Breakpoint is out on October 4th, with a beta going live September 5th, spec-ops fans. Ubisoft will bring back AI companions for solo players in the next Ghost Recon, we\u2019re being told. They\u2019re also launching a new hub for \u2018community creators\u2019. I\u2019m still thinking about Watch Dogs Legion. I want to hijack a bus Ghost Recon Breakpoint involves a lot of jungle fighting, on the evidence of this trailer. Certainly a change of pace from the very urban Division 2 Here\u2019s a trailer for the new Rainbow Six Siege update, available now: Jon Bernthal has brought a dog onto the stage. Not sure whether people are more excited about the celebrity or the pooch \u201cThe only test of a man\u2019s worth is battle,\u201d says a mean-looking Jon Bernthal in a new trailer for the new Tom Clancy\u2019s Ghost Recon, one of Ubisoft\u2019s several military-themed shooters. Now Adventure Time\u2019s Finn and Jake are here to shill Brawlhalla, the Smash Bros-esque arena fighting game. Not quite Keanu Reeves but I\u2019ll take it. Here\u2019s that Watch Dogs footage for you - definitely the best thing I\u2019ve seen at the show so far. The trailer for this comedy show (?) is so close to actual promotional videos from video game developers that I\u2019m not 100% sure it\u2019s a joke That\u2019s it for Watch Dogs - now Rob McElhenney of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia is here to talk about his new Apple TV show about game developers, Mythic Quest. Oooh, a release date! March 6th, 2020. With the usual caveat that this is E3 footage and who knows how closely it will resemble the final game, this is very encouraging. Watch Dogs Legion is playable on the E3 show floor. \u201cEvery Londoner is fully simulated, with a persistent life and relationships... anyone can be won over to your cause.\u201d They\u2019re all voiced and animated, and every cinematic in the game will change depending on whom you\u2019re playing. Play a squad of old ladies in Bletchley Park or a team of classic British spies. This is unprecedented! \u201cWhere London goes, all of us go together,\u201d says Clint. \u201cThe UK has become a surveillance state and freedom replaces fear... deportation squads rip people from their homes and Grandad is using cryptocurrency to buy a new kidney on the black market.\u201d Bloody hell, Clint, we know Brexit is going to be bad, no need to rub it in We\u2019ve got a name: Watch Dogs Legion. It\u2019s being directed by Clint Hocking, famous for Far Cry 2. Bet we won\u2019t get any \u201cbut it\u2019s not political, honest\u201d nonsense from him. There\u2019s some really impressive open-world action stuff going on here - this could easily challenge Grand Theft Auto (perhaps not that surprising, at GTA V is pretty old now and it\u2019s about time there was a new open-world crime game on the scene). We now appear to be riding a drone around the backstreets of rainy Camden before infiltrating a weed-and-weapons operation that also appears to be into human trafficking. Look, I know Camden Market has changed over the years, but really If you want grannies tasing London cops before hopping on a bus to Camden Market, this is absolutely the game for you Now we\u2019re playing an elderly lady in compression stockings who is also a LEVEL 12 HACKER, and is casing Scotland Yard. Not going to lie, this looks brilliant. We\u2019re tooling about the place in a black cab now, having started a gun-fight with the armed police. If you lose a character in action, they\u2019re gone forever - you move on to a new London citizen to continue their work. After some preamble from superfluous hosts, we\u2019re onto Ubisoft\u2019s big announcement of the night: a new Watch Dogs game set in post-Brexit London. Extremists have taken over, technology companies\u2019 power is out of control, and we as platers can recruit take control of any citizen we see to mount a resistance. In the gameplay footage, we see a mouthy skinhead walking around a convincing futuristic Piccadilly Square. Well, this is rather sedate and pleasant. I do love a bit of classical music with my video game news. Here comes the news! We\u2019re in the Orpheum Theatre in LA as a live orchestra plays Assassin\u2019s Creed music to open proceedings. Two cool pieces of Assassin\u2019s Creed news before the show (Odyssey, that is, not the forthcoming viking-themed one): Ubisoft has opened up a story creation tool on PC that lets players mess around with the game\u2019s narrative tools to create their own quests; and Discovery Tour (the interactive-museum-like mode that premiered in Origins\u2019 Ancient Egypt) is coming to Odyssey\u2019s Ancient Greece. You can get quizzed on your Spartan history by King Leonidas. Genuinely cool. Man, if only Keanu Reeves had come out last night at the Xbox presser and just straight-up told people not to be dicks when playing online \u201cDon\u2019t be a toxic dick!\u201d advises Ice-T. \u201cThere\u2019s an art to dealing with trolls. Mute the dumb f***s. I\u2019m sick of hearing sexist, racist, homophobic bullshit from the assholes out there trying to ruin it for the rest of us.\u201d Uh... right on, Ice-T! If you happened to be watching the Ubisoft pre-show right now, you\u2019d be seeing Ice-T running down some rules of gamer etiquette. It\u2019s far too early for this. Also, I know it gets a lot of stick, but I personally love the yearly Just Dance costumed choreography. Whilst we\u2019re waiting for Ubisoft to kick off, shall we relive some of the best Ubi moments from E3s past? I\u2019m particularly partial to when the creative director at Trials developer RedLynx crashed spectacularly. I\u2019m only 80% sure it was staged. Quick reminder of what to expect from today\u2019s/tonight\u2019s remaining conferences: Ubisoft - 1:00 PM PT / 9:00 PM BST: at least two interesting new games, both of which have sadly already leaked and one of which might be of particular interest to those of us envisioning a grim post-Brexit future Square Enix - 6:00 PM PT / 2:00 AM BST: the premiere of a new Avengers game will be the star here, alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake That was an absolute marathon from the PC Gaming Show! We\u2019ve got about 45 minutes until Ubisoft kicks off - see you then. Shenmue 3 is out on 19 November, with the PC version exclusive to the Epic Games store. The trailer showed some combat and story scenes and there\u2019s a classic Dreamcast feel to it. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is out in the first quarter of 2020 and looks like its a fitting successor to the cult gothic masterpiece. Chivalry 2 lets you chop limbs off, and even keep fighting when your own limbs have been severed. Maneater still looks like the world\u2019s greatest open-world shark RPG. That\u2019s me signing off. Stay tuned for Keza and Ubisoft! Well, I think that\u2019s all from the PC Gaming Show. Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed it. I\u2019ll add a few more trailers so do keep refreshing. Alright old-timers, here comes Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 from Larian Studios, which was announced recently. Larian got the rights to develop the classic D&amp;D role-playing series, which is over 20 years old. All the iconic monsters, characters and places are in there apparently, and there are systems to allow emergent combat, just like a tabletop D&amp;D experience. There will also be a Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 prequel tabletop game - it\u2019s out in September and it\u2019ll give players an idea of what\u2019s happening in the world, which is set 100 years after Baldur\u2019s Gate 2. As yet though, Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 has no release date. Genesis Noir is an existential odyssey from Fellow Traveller, set during the Big Bang. The trailer is quite a thing - a monochrome film noir-esque confection with jazz soundtrack and Saul Bass references. It looks like you wander amongst the birthing planets, um... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll dig out the trailer and leave it to you. Now it\u2019s Telling Lies from Annapurna Interactive and Sam Barlow, the creator of the brilliant CCTV thriller Her Story. Here, you watch video footage to piece together the story in which a woman has stolen an NSA memory stick showing footage of the game\u2019s four characters. Something has gone horribly wrong and you have to work out what and why. You can pick out certain words and phrases spoken by the characters, looking them up on an in-game database. It looks like footage is taken from fictitious video diaries and video phone messages. There\u2019s a confessional Sex, Lies and Videotape feel to it all. Players have to pick up on the subtext of each recording, listen out for names and places and start making links. Apparently there\u2019s over ten hours of footage and the story encompasses two years of events. Telling Lies is out \u201cvery soon\u201d according to Barlow. Yay, it\u2019s time for Maneater, which was a highlight of last year\u2019s PC Gaming Show. It\u2019s an open-world shark RPG - you start as a baby shark (do do do do do doooo) and have to eat to survive. At key life phases you make a big jump in size and power and as that happens you can evolve parts of your body - for example, metal teeth and mutated lungs. The trailer shows you stalking a boat load of hairy fishermen, causing havoc. Scaly Pete is the villain of the story - he\u2019s the Quint of the game, a shark hunter. The story of the game is revealed through a reality TV show following Pete on his adventures. \u2018GTA but you\u2019re a shark\u2019 is the elevator pitch. It\u2019ll be out within a year. Borderlands 3 is on stage now with questions from the community. The developers are adding lots of different grenades, unique class mods which give new skills, and artefacts which add to movement allowing you to slide faster, or adding explosions to sliding. As for end game content, there\u2019s a Guardian system like the previous Bad Ass Ranks, which provides infinite progression. Boss fights - there will be huge ones. There will be multiple huge vaults with giant bosses, as well as mini-bosses littered about. Multiplayer will allow participants to jump in at any time. Tiny Tina will be fighting alongside the vault raiders. The level limit will be 50. You\u2019ll be able to transfer weapons between characters. I think that\u2019s it. A world exclusive reveal of CrisTales from Modus Games, a love letter to classic JRPGs. The visuals are beautiful and highly stylised. You can rewrite the past and change the future apparently. Will have to watch this again later as it\u2019s lovely. Auto Chess from Chinese publisher Dragonest has been a success on mobile and now it\u2019s coming to PC. It\u2019s a chess-themed MOBA title coming to the Epic Store later this year. Here\u2019s Patrice D\u00e9silets, the creator of Assassin\u2019s Creed, talking about his new title, Ancestors, which is about the evolution of the human race \u2013 so not particularly ambitious then. You play modern humankind\u2019s predecessors and must guide a clan through dangerous landscapes and lots of predators. There\u2019s no story, there are no mini-maps, you\u2019re just trying to survive and evolve. It\u2019s out 27 August. Here\u2019s what Keza thought of it a few months back: Okay so after a reveal for Vermin Tide 2, the fantasy co-op game, we move onto Per Aspera where you play as an AI orbiting Mars charged with terraforming the planet so humans can live on it. Admittedly I missed most of the Songs of Conquest trailer because I was having a little cry, but it\u2019s a fantasy strategy adventure where you gather resources to build up your town, then take part in turn-based battles. The Heroes of Might and Magic series has been a major influence. He\u2019s here to talk about Shenmue 3, which was recently delayed. He says thank you to the fans for supporting him for over 20 years. You\u2019re welcome Suzuki-san. Okay, it\u2019s a world exclusive look at the game! We start with a grand master telling Ryo his kung fu isn\u2019t strong enough. They spar in lovely detail. Then we get our hero running through a beautifully intricate small town, fighting local gangsters. The dialogue is classic Shenmue. My heart is bursting. It\u2019s out 19 November! Thank you, Yu Suzuki! Oh my god, Yu Suzuki is on stage \u2013 the genius behind Outrun, Hang-On and Virtua Fighter. *Sega fanboy faints* Planet Zoo is a zoo management game from Frontier Developments, the UK studio behind Elite Dangerous and a whole host of Tycoon sims. Here comes the trailer. Run your dream zoo (we all have one), and... oh I\u2019ve just been distracted by a photorealistic hippo doing a giant poo... where was I? It\u2019s a modern zoo so you learn about conservation while you play \u2013 the health and welfare of your animals is the most important aspect. Griftlands is a turn-based card-battling adventure with nice cell-shaded cartoon visuals. Alpha keys become available on 11 July. Remnant: From the Ashes from Gunfire Games is up \u2013 it\u2019s a co-op action shooter set on an apocalyptic Earth and other worlds. Replayability is a big focus with NPCs, missions and areas all newly generated each time. You can play over and over and never see the same monsters and areas twice. Bosses drop unique loot so you\u2019ll get weapons and armour that your friends might never have found. You can bring pals in to take on the biggest threats. It\u2019s out on 20 August. Zombie Army Dead War 4 is the next shooter from the makers of Sniper Elite 4. It\u2019s 1946 and Europe has been torn to pieces by an evil zombie-esque army. The trailer shows a variety of fighters battling hordes of the undead, some armed with flame throwers. The game uses the same slow-mo bullet-tracking effect as the Sniper Elite series so you get to see brains flying out and skulls exploding if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. You can set up trip wires to electrify enemies, or just splatter them with mini cannon. Age of Wonders: Planetfall is a strategy game where you play as a survivor of a shattered civilisation looking to reboot your society. Each race has different abilities and there are genetic labs to set up to create battling monsters, including dinosaurs with laser beams. That\u2019s dinosaurs with fricking laser beams. You also get orbital laser cannon, and a science lab where you can build cyber-soldiers and deadly viruses. The game is due on PC and consoles on 6 August, which is the day after my birthday. The Last Oasis is an open-world adventure in which the Earth has stopped rotating and now humanity must keep moving through the endless deserts to survive. Looks like you\u2019ll be piloting wind-powered land ships and besieging wooden castles. It\u2019s out in September. After a brief look at a new Samsung monitor, we\u2019re on to Funcom\u2019s upcoming titles including Mutant Year Zero: Seed of Evil, fantasy battle game Conan Unconquered (29 May) and Cthulu-esque sci-fi horror title Moons of Madness (Halloween 2019). Now the founder of Australian studio Mighty Kingdom is showing off Conan Chop Chop, a cute-looking roguelike action adventure \u2013 sort of Zelda meets Castle Crashers. It\u2019s out in September and looks fun. I\u2019m adding trailers as I go along by the way, so keep refreshing! The permadeath adventure sequel Unexplored 2 from Big Sugar is up next. The lovely bright visuals are a contrast to all the gothic darkness we\u2019ve had so far. A quick trailer from dark dystopian adventure game Mosaic: This is followed by a look at spooky multiplayer game Midnight Ghost Hunt. The ghost hunters in rubber suits have to track down spooks who are able to hide in inanimate objects like lamps and chairs. Players take part in teams, hunters vs spooks, and the latter have to stay hidden and safe until the clock strikes midnight. When that time comes, the roles switch and the ghosts hunt the humans. There will be an alpha event in the summer. And now it\u2019s Starmancer from Chucklefish, an isometric-view space craft simulator, which looks cute and in-depth simultaneously. After that it\u2019s Chivalry 2 from Tripwire Interactive and Torn Banner, a medieval-themed sword-fighting game. The trailer shows an attack on a castle with lots of siege equipment and splashing blood noises. We\u2019re promised more fluid animation and a core focus on fighting multiple opponents at the same time. \u201cWe know half of people play the game drunk,\u201d says someone on stage. The teaser ends with a horseman performing a hilarious surprise beheading on a fleeing enemy, which doesn\u2019t seem particularly chivalrous. It\u2019s multiplayer with up to 64 players and it\u2019s coming next year. Next up: the world\u2019s first gameplay footage of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 from Paradox Interactive. Lots of gothic darkness, stabbings and cool characters in long coats. The vampires stay in the shadows and feed on human blood to fill up their health meters. But there are different types of blood, based on the emotional resonance of the victim. According to writer (and erstwhile Guardian games contributor) Cara Ellison, there will be fragile volatile relationships with the non-player characters, and lots of moral quandaries around feeding off the living. It\u2019s coming out in the first quarter of 2020. Here comes Evil Genius 2: World Domination from UK studio Rebellion, the sequel to the company\u2019s 1960s supervillain simulator. A fun trailer shows the Austin Powers-style vibe. Oh no, apparently, they\u2019re going to be pulling comments from the Twitch and YouTube chat streams. This isn\u2019t going to end well. Broadcasting live from the Mayan Theatre in Los Angeles for the next two hours with Sean Plott and Frankie Ward hosting. While we\u2019re waiting, you can check out the rest of out E3 coverage so far! The Xbox conference live-blog \u2013 all the news from Microsoft\u2019s big night, as it happened. Project Scarlett: what we know so far about the next Xbox \u2013 we don\u2019t know much, but here it all is! Bethesda at E3 2019 \u2013 Deathloop and Ghostwire Tokyo enliven a muted show. E3 2019: all the video game news so far \u2013 Keza rounds everything up into one convenient news burst. Hello! Games correspondent Keith Stuart here. I\u2019ll be live-blogging the PC Gaming Show. We\u2019re just waiting for the kick off, but the organisers have promised at least 30 new games including some world exclusive reveals. We can expect more information on Borderlands 3, the shark action game Maneater and maybe a peek at Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the sequel to the cult 2004 title. There should also be news from indie-centric publishers Annapurna Interactive and Chucklefish. But the best thing about this event is the surprise element \u2013 without major publishers dominating, there\u2019s more room for unexpected delights. We\u2019ll be bringing you news, trailers and commentary throughout the day\u2019s events (and photos from E3, if technology editor Alex Hern can find good wifi). Here\u2019s a quick schedule for the day (or the evening, if you\u2019re joining us from the UK), along with what to expect: The PC Gaming Show - 10:00 AM PT / 6:00 PM BST: organised by long-running games media giant PC Gamer, this showcase usually spotlights some highly entertaining games that might otherwise fly under the radar Ubisoft - 1:00 PM PT / 9:00 PM BST: at least two interesting new games, both of which have sadly already leaked and one of which might be of particular interest to those of us envisioning a grim post-Brexit future Square-Enix - 6:00 PM PT / 2:00 AM BST: the premiere of a new Avengers game will be the star here, alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s E3 2019 liveblog! Today\u2019s updates are brought to you by video games editor Keza MacDonald and correspondent Keith Stuart, as we take you through the PC Gaming Show, Ubisoft\u2019s press conference, and lastly Square Enix\u2019s presentation.",

      "bodyText": "Labor leader Anthony Albanese has said he will move to expel union leader John Setka from the Labor Party, because his reported comments on domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty are out of step with mainstream Australia. Speaking in Perth on Tuesday, Albanese revealed he had asked the party\u2019s national executive committee to suspend Setka immediately, and would move a motion to have him booted from the party at the next meeting of the ALP\u2019s administrative body. Setka, the Victorian secretary of the CFMMEU, has claimed he was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d after the Age reported he told a union meeting Batty\u2019s advocacy had led to men having fewer rights. On Tuesday, Setka said he had fallen victim to \u201cdirty ALP politics\u201d and that people were \u201cmaking up lies about what I said\u201d. Albanese said he had written to the national executive on Tuesday morning after speaking to Batty, who was made an officer of the Order of Australia as part of the Queen\u2019s Birthday honours list on Monday. \u201cMy concern here is that John Setka undermines the credibility of the trade union movement through the position that he holds and the public views that he has expressed,\u201d Albanese said. Setka told The New Daily on Tuesday he had the \u201cutmost respect for Rosie Batty\u201d. \u201cEvery time I see Rosie Batty I want to give her a hug,\u201d he said. \u201cI would rather be called corrupt. It\u2019s not even an exaggeration of what I said. It\u2019s an outright lie.\u201d He did concede he had said lawyers had told him laws had been skewed against men following the Victorian royal commission into family violence and Batty\u2019s campaigns. Sekta\u2019s comments came after a concerted push to have him stand down. \u201cIf any of these allegation[s] are correct, John Setka must resign,\u201d the ACTU secretary, SallyMcManus, said in a new statement on Tuesday. McManus did not address which allegations she was referring to but a spokesman said she was not addressing any matters before the courts. The ACTU secretary has been overseas for a labour conference but has now chosen to fly home early to deal with the unfolding crisis. Michelle O\u2019Neil, the ACTU president, added: \u201cWe will not tolerate violence against women in our movement, our leaders must demonstrate our values.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, backed Albanese\u2019s actions on Tuesday afternoon, saying Setka\u2019s reported comments about Batty were \u201cdisgraceful and his refusal to apologise for them is appalling\u201d. The Victorian government also intends to dump Setka from a government board \u2013 the Building Industry Consultative Council. Albanese\u2019s comments come after Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, also declared herself on the side of Batty and called on Setka to consider his position. \u201cI want to say to Rosie Batty, I\u2019m on your side,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI thought his comments about Ms Batty were completely inappropriate. They are not in step with the values of the broader labour movement or the Labor party.\u201d On Tuesday the outgoing senator Doug Cameron called on Setka to resign. He said on Twitter he strongly supported the CFMMEU, but Setka should \u201cput the movement and members first by resigning\u201d. Batty, whose son Luke was killed by her estranged husband in 2014, told the ABC on Monday that Setka\u2019s remarks were \u201cludicrous\u201d and an example of \u201csomebody whose leadership role really needs to be challenged\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m quite astonished with those comments,\u201d said Batty, who was on Monday appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for her advocacy. \u201cRather than feel, you know, men have less rights, we have so much more to gain by recognising that moving forward we\u2019re [moving to] a place of equality.\u201d Last month Setka also told a Victorian court he would plead guilty to charges of harassing a woman. Setka\u2019s role as state secretary is elected, meaning it would be hard to remove him unless he stood down. Sources close to the ACTU said that internal discussions around Setka\u2019s future began some time ago. They said the ACTU would argue it would not be appropriate for Setka to remain in his role if a harassment conviction was recorded. The CFMMEU has been approached for comment.",

The GOP-controlled Senate won\u2019t pass the funding measure unless the abortion restriction stays in and, even if the Senate did, Donald Trump would swiftly use his presidential power to <strong>veto</strong> it. <br>Most leading figures in the Democratic 2020 field already opposed the Hyde Amendment, though many of them have voted for it by default during their Senate or House careers as part of much larger appropriations bills. <br>Democratic efforts this week to repeal the Hyde Amendment appear designed to fail. Hyde first added the provision to the annual measure in 1976.</p> \n  <p>Representative <strong>Barbara Lee</strong> of California, is a leading voice on the Hill seeking to offer an anti-Hyde provision to the almost $1 trillion spending bill combining health and education spending with the budget for the Pentagon and a handful of other Cabinet departments. <br></p> \n  <p>But that approach wouldn\u2019t just repeal the Hyde Amendment. It would also mandate new policy to require that the government \u201censure coverage for abortion in public health insurance programs\u201d and other steps.</p> \n  <p>Democratic leaders are not expected to allow Lee to offer the amendment as they announce the rules for floor debate later on Monday, aides said. <br><br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a00d455d127e241394e58ed6d00a9ee0cb465291\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a00d455d127e241394e58ed6d00a9ee0cb465291/2_0_2939_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congresswoman Barbara Lee, second from left, here in the House with, from left, freshman Democrat reps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, Annie Kuster, of Texas, and Jan Schakowsky, of Illinois.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congresswoman Barbara Lee, second from left, here in the House with, from left, freshman Democrat reps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, Annie Kuster, of Texas, and Jan Schakowsky, of Illinois.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call,Inc.</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-10T20:44:40.762Z\">at 9.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cfeba758f0880dcae93c106\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-10T20:22:17.085Z\">9.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Nobody wants to hear much from John Malcolm, even Republicans</h2> \n  <p>The Democratic-controlled House judiciary committee seemingly made the effort to have a (token) genuine, lasting <strong>conservative</strong> on the panel of witnesses testifying today in their Mueller report \u2018splain session: the <strong>Heritage Foundation</strong> and <strong>Federalist Society</strong>\u2019s <strong>John Malcolm</strong>.</p> \n  <p>But after more than two hours of this hearing, Malcolm has only been asked one (boring) question, and has even admitted \u201cfeeling lonesome here\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The Democrats want to talk to <strong>Dean, Vance</strong> and <strong>McQuade</strong> to get them to say horrid things about Trump and the Republicans want to talk to Dean, Vance and McQuade to say horrid things about them, or just make them listen to plaudits for the president or brickbats for folks like James Comey.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019re not learning much that\u2019s non-partisan.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-10T20:23:52.459Z\">at 9.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cfeb7398f0880dcae93c0f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-10T20:11:03.199Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Witness Barbara McQuade on Trump: \u201cThis constitutes obstruction\u201d</h2> \n  <p>Former US attorney and now Michigan law professor Barb McQuade just had an interesting interaction with Florida Democrat and committee member Ted Deutch.</p> \n  <p>They talked about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/20/donald-trump-robert-mueller-presidents-men\">events</a> detailed in <strong>Robert Mueller</strong>\u2019s report that Donald Trump asked then White House counsel <strong>Don McGahn</strong> to call then deputy attorney general <strong>Rod Rosenstei</strong><strong>n</strong> and order him to \u201cget rid\u201d of special counsel Mueller.

The House oversight committee is set to vote Wednesday on whether to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoenas related to the 2020 Census. US Customs and Border Protection was hit by a \u201cmalicious cyber attack\u201d that compromised photos of travelers. Read the Guardian\u2019s full story below: A judge granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the state\u2019s last abortion clinic, allowing the clinic to stay open and temporarily preventing the state from becoming the first in the country with no access to legal abortion. The Missouri department of health and senior services had declined to renew the St Louis Planned Parenthood clinic\u2019s license to perform abortions, citing alleged concerns with \u201cfailed abortions\u201d, compromised patient safety and legal violations at the clinic. The refusal to renew the license came after Republican governor Mike Parson signed a restrictive bill prohibiting the procedure after eight weeks and criminalizing doctors who perform it - and is part of growing push against women\u2019s reproductive rights in the US. Richard Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel John Dean testified before the House judiciary committee today, bringing the fire by stating that \u201cRobert Mueller has provided this committee with a road map\u201d to impeachment. It appears Dean\u2019s superfans were also there. Here\u2019s something fun: Lissandra Villa, a Time magazine reporter, has the walk-out song playlist for the 2020 candidates at the Iowa Democrats Hall of Fame campaign event yesterday.

The House oversight committee will vote Wednesday on whether to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoenas related to the 2020 Census and the question about citizenship. Read committee chair Elijah Cummings\u2019 full resolution here. The Washington Post is reporting that photos of travelers were leaked in a recent data breach, but the federal agency would not go into detail about the number of images comprised or the nature of them. The leak stemmed from a cyber attack on a federal subcontractor, according to the Post. Why is this so alarming? Quick reminder that even though agency officials declined to say what images were compromised, US Customs and Border Protection maintains a database of passport and visa photos as part of an agency facial-recognition program. The Post also pointed out that the agency \u201cmakes extensive use of cameras and video recordings at the arrival halls of international airports as well as land border crossings, where vehicle license plates are also captured.\u201d Agency officials confirmed that some photos that had been compromised included photos of people\u2019s license plates. \u201cThis breach comes just as CBP seeks to expand its massive face recognition apparatus and collection of sensitive information from travelers, including license plate information and social media identifiers,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Post. \u201cThis incident further underscores the need to put the brakes on these efforts and for Congress to investigate the agency\u2019s data practices. The best way to avoid breaches of sensitive personal data is not to collect and retain it in the first place.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over for Joanna Walters. Happy Monday. Early evening summary \u2022 The House judiciary committee hearing with former Nixon White House counsel John Dean and former US attorneys as witnesses, discussing the Mueller report and the issue of presidential obstruction of justice, is continuing. Dean has said the Mueller report should be the Watergate equivalent of a \u2018road map\u2019 for Congress to impeach Trump on grounds of obstruction of justice. \u2022Leading House Democrats outside of the 2020 presidential race are unlikely to successfully be able to oppose the Hyde Amendment that restricts abortion funding, because it would put much larger and wider spending legislation at risk. \u2022 The president has been informed about the fatal helicopter crash on the top of a building in New York City, and has tweeted about it. City mayor Bill de Blasio, a 2020 candidate for the White House, has been speaking about the incident on TV. Committee Dems and witnesses play whiffle ball It\u2019s not even softball at the House hearing at this hour. California Democrat Ted Lieu sends the softest, underarm delivery to John Dean. Lieu just quoted Donald Trump, as quoted in the Mueller report, without beeps or asterisks. He quotes to the hearing the bit where the president apparently slumped back in his chair upon hearing about the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate him, in May 2017, and said it was the end of his presidency adding, Lieu then reads out from notes without wavering, \u201cI\u2019m fucked\u201d. Trump was furious that his then attorney general Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation and that deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had appointed Mueller. Lieu then leaps to current attorney general Bill Barr, who has been accused of acting like Trump\u2019s defense lawyer. Lieu to John Dean: \u201cIs it the role of attorney general to protect the president?\u201d Dean: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case in the Nixon White House. I know there is a proud and professional workforce at the Department of Justice that does not do anything other than represent the American people.\u201d He then goes on to list attorneys general who served under Richard Nixon, saying that he did not think they regarded it as \u201ctheir job to represent Nixon\u201d, and adding: \u201cThis is an unprecedented view from Trump as to the function of the attorney general [Barr].\u201d Lieu lobs it to witness Barb McQuade, who whacks a home run. \u201cHe is not the personal attorney for the president,\u201d she says. It\u2019s starting to feel like 5PM on Capitol Hill. As the committee hearing continues on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, top Democrats in Washington are intent on preserving a four-decade ban on taxpayer-financed abortions despite calls from their party\u2019s presidential candidates to abandon it, the AP reports. Leading figures argue that attempts to undo the longstanding consensus will fail - and efforts won\u2019t be worth scuttling a key education and health funding bill. While 2020 presidential candidates such as Democratic front-runner Joe Biden hustle to rewrite their positions on the so-called Hyde Amendment, legislative veterans such as congresswoman Rosa DeLauro have worked behind the scenes to smooth the waters for the provision to continue. It is a long-settled feature of the annual funding measure, which contains numerous programs dear to Democrats. Pragmatism is at play. The GOP-controlled Senate won\u2019t pass the funding measure unless the abortion restriction stays in and, even if the Senate did, Donald Trump would swiftly use his presidential power to veto it. Most leading figures in the Democratic 2020 field already opposed the Hyde Amendment, though many of them have voted for it by default during their Senate or House careers as part of much larger appropriations bills. Democratic efforts this week to repeal the Hyde Amendment appear designed to fail. Hyde first added the provision to the annual measure in 1976. Representative Barbara Lee of California, is a leading voice on the Hill seeking to offer an anti-Hyde provision to the almost $1 trillion spending bill combining health and education spending with the budget for the Pentagon and a handful of other Cabinet departments. But that approach wouldn\u2019t just repeal the Hyde Amendment. It would also mandate new policy to require that the government \u201censure coverage for abortion in public health insurance programs\u201d and other steps. Democratic leaders are not expected to allow Lee to offer the amendment as they announce the rules for floor debate later on Monday, aides said. Nobody wants to hear much from John Malcolm, even Republicans The Democratic-controlled House judiciary committee seemingly made the effort to have a (token) genuine, lasting conservative on the panel of witnesses testifying today in their Mueller report \u2018splain session: the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society\u2019s John Malcolm. But after more than two hours of this hearing, Malcolm has only been asked one (boring) question, and has even admitted \u201cfeeling lonesome here\u201d. The Democrats want to talk to Dean, Vance and McQuade to get them to say horrid things about Trump and the Republicans want to talk to Dean, Vance and McQuade to say horrid things about them, or just make them listen to plaudits for the president or brickbats for folks like James Comey. We\u2019re not learning much that\u2019s non-partisan. Witness Barbara McQuade on Trump: \u201cThis constitutes obstruction\u201d Former US attorney and now Michigan law professor Barb McQuade just had an interesting interaction with Florida Democrat and committee member Ted Deutch. They talked about events detailed in Robert Mueller\u2019s report that Donald Trump asked then White House counsel Don McGahn to call then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and order him to \u201cget rid\u201d of special counsel Mueller. And then the president asked McGahn to lie about that, despite multiple urgings from Trump that he \u201cchange his recollection\u201d about their exchange. McQuade tells the committee that Mueller\u2019s report that Trump asked McGahn to create a false document about their exchange regarding Mueller is \u201cthe most serious allegation.\u201d \u201cThis constitutes obstruction of justice\u201d by the president, McQuade says. Florida Republican Matt Gaetz, on the House judiciary committee just sparred with John Dean - but not about Mueller, his report, collusion or obstructio n. Here\u2019s the moment: Mexico tries to clear confusion on tariffs and immigration row with US, indicates Trump gave \u201cultimatum\u201d over tariffs Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard spent Monday trying to clear up confusion sown by a pair of Trump tweets, which implied that there were further elements to the deal between the US and Mexico on migrants transiting Mexico and crossing the US border - that have yet to be revealed, David Agren reports from Mexico City. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican imports if the country didn\u2019t make good on an unannounced, but \u201cfully signed and documented\u201d part of the deal struck last week to avoid Trump slapping tariffs on Mexican imports. Ebrard responded on Monday that everything agreed to in the deal was outlined in a joint statement. Ebrard also told reporters both sides would evaluate whether the stream of migrants had slowed. \u201cIn 45 days both sides have to sit down and say, \u2018well, was it successful or unsuccessful?\u201d Ebrard said of the arrangement. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have results we would have to discuss an agreement which includes the return of asylum seekers under a regional perspective.\u201d The regional perspective, Ebrard said, included countries in the hemisphere such as Brazil, Panama and Guatemala. Trump tweeted Monday that Mexico\u2019s congress would have to ratify \u201can important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico.\u201d But Ebrard said he told US negotiators that he would only have to go his country\u2019s congress \u201cif perhaps these measures don\u2019t work\u201d and they top to pursue a regional deal. Mexican officials have often been forced to try and thread the needle with their responses: clarifying details from negotiations and providing facts on the bilateral relationship, but avoiding any antagonizing of Trump. \u201cImmigration is Trump\u2019s top issue\u201d Ebrard said, acknowledging the political landscape north of the US-Mexico border. \u201cThe entire tone of the relationship with Mexico depends on that.\u201d Ebrard has had the delicate task of correcting errors in Trumps tweets. On Monday, he contradicted Trump\u2019s claim on Twitter on Saturday that Mexico would buy \u201clarge quantities of agricultural products from US farmers, saying on Monday: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a specific agreement on products of this kind.\u201d Describing negotiations in Washington last week, Ebrard said: \u201cIt was very tough. Not tough in the sense that they were rude, rather very tough in the sense the tone was almost one of ultimatum\u201d. He quickly offered a qualification: \u201cActually, get rid of the \u2018almost,\u2019\u201d he said. John Dean: I think there is evidence of collusion in the report Congressman Steve Chabot, Republican of Ohio, gives a fascinating preamble to his question to John Dean. Chabot says he was 19 when, in 1972, he voted for Richard Nixon. In 1973 Chabot said he was on his honeymoon (TMI, Steve) when he watched on TV as John Dean testified to the Senate over the Watergate scandal cover-up. He recalls that many of his friends said that the evidence of such appalling abuse of power by the president and all his men turned them off politics. \u201cBut I thought the opposite. I thought we needed people to go into politics for the right reasons,\u201d Chabot says. He mentions that in 1976 he voted for Jimmy Carter, FYI. He entered local politics in Cincinnati, as a Republican, and eventually became a member of Congress. He sat on the judiciary committee and was closely involved in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s now 20 years after that and it\u2019s been alleged that another president has done something wrong.\u201d Chabot says Mueller found \u201cno collusion\u201d between Donald Trump or members of his election campaign and the Russian government or its operatives and on the obstruction of justice question, Mueller punted the topic to Congress. Then points out that attorney general William Barr declared there had been no obstruction. Chabot finally gets to his sort-of question. Asks John Dean about a report that he alleged Donald Trump colluded with the Russians. John Dean replies: I don\u2019t think I quite said collusion. I think there is evidence of collusion in the report, by the way.\u201d Professor Joyce White Vance would prosecute Trump for obstruction Witness Vance tells the House judiciary committee she believes so strongly that Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice in the way he interfered with and attempted to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation that she would prosecute. \u201cI would be willing to personally indict the case...and win on appeal,\u201d she said. Vance is a former federal prosecutor from Alabama. President informed of helicopter crash A brief interruption to our committee hearing coverage to mention that Donald Trump has reportedly been informed about an incident in New York. A helicopter has crashed on top of a building in midtown Manhattan this afternoon, with what looks like, at this early stage, a possible fatality. You can follow the news developments as they unfold in our separate story, here. Richard Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel John Dean just began his testimony with a bang. He first notes that he last appeared before the House judiciary committee on July 11, 1974, at the impeachment inquiry into president Nixon (who resigned in August, 1974). Dean says: \u201cI hope I can give a little historical perspective on the Mueller report. In many ways it is to Donald Trump what the \u2018Watergate road map\u2019 was to Nixon.\u201d He\u2019s referring to the evidence Congress used to support its impeachment of Nixon, leading ultimately after the whole Watergate scandal, to the downfall of the president. \u201cStated a little bit differently, Robert Mueller has provided this committee with a road map,\u201d Dean said. The Watergate \u2018road map\u2019 was the report that Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski sent to Congress in 1974 and that informed its impeachment proceedings, which were already underway. Dean is wearing a navy suit and sports thinned white hair and thin-rimmed spectacles. Nadler predicts Don McGahn will testify before Congress \u201cbefore long\u201d Even though the DoJ has agreed to start handing over crucial Mueller investigation material to the committee, Nadler says House Democrats will go ahead tomorrow with voting on the House floor over legal action to enforce subpoenas not only to obtain the full unredacted Mueller report and underlying documents, but also to compel former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify on the Hill. McGahn, a key witness in Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation, has so far declined to testify, as instructed by the White House, despite being subpoenaed. McGahn refused to get rid of Mueller when Trump asked him to and declined to lie about it afterwards. Nadler points out that he and GOP ranking member of the committee, Doug Collins, \u201cagree on the seriousness\u201d of Russian interference in the US election. Nadler reminds us that the Russians interfered with our election No ifs, no buts, judiciary chair Jerry Nadler reminds us that special counsel Robert Mueller found that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 US presidential election, in a direct attack on American democracy. Nadler says: \u201cThere is no question that Congress must investigate this attack....without delay.\u201d He says Mueller found that there were 171 contacts between operatives of the Russian government and 16 Trump campaign officials. House Judiciary Committee hearing about to get underway with John Dean as witness The committee, witnesses and public are settling in, with the usual flurry of press photographers. Chairman Jerry Nadler has called the committee to come to order. Watch live! Streaming now at top of this blog. Trump superfan and anti-immigration hardliner to oversee USCIS An outspoken supporter of Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies has been named acting director of the federal agency that manages legal immigration. Ken Cuccinelli will oversee US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Cuccinelli is a former Virginia attorney general and has advocated for denying citizenship to the American-born children of parents living in the US illegally and for limiting in-state tuition at public universities only to citizens or legal residents, the AP writes. Cuccinelli\u2019s name has been mentioned for months to become part of the Trump administration, including as possible Homeland Security secretary or as an immigration \u2018czar\u2019. It\u2019s unclear if Trump will nominate Cuccinelli for the permanent position. That would require Senate confirmation, which could be difficult, even with the Republicans in control of that chamber. The position opened after Trump forced the resignation of Lee Francis Cissna. Trump believed he wasn\u2019t doing enough. Cissna said he worked \u201cpassionately.\u201d Early afternoon summary A busy Monday so far. The House judiciary committee begins its hearing with John Dean and others in half an hour. Meanwhile this morning: House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler announced that an agreement had been reached for the DoJ to start turning over \u201ckey\u201d materials from the special counsel Robert Mueller (who stepped down as an employee of the DoJ last month) Trump-Russia investigation. This put his plans (whether real or not) to hold attorney general Bill Barr (top dog at the DoJ) in criminal contempt of Congress \u201cin abeyance for now\u201d. Shenanigans involving US-Mexico negotiations over immigration remain intense, despite Trump pulling back on Friday from his threat to impose tariffs on the United States\u2019s southern neighbor from today. Confusion continues about what is and is not in the latest US-Mexico agreement on the subject, what\u2019s new, what\u2019s old, what\u2019s secret and what isn\u2019t. More to come on that from out correspondent in Mexico soon. The US Supreme Court has rejected an appeal against government restrictions on gun silencers and backed away from taking up an appeal for the release of a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay who has been held there without charge since 2001. Senior Republican responds to developments over Mueller House Republican Doug Collins, of Georgia, the ranking member of the judiciary committee, has released a statement regarding what he terms \u201cfurther accommodations\u201d from DoJ. \u201cThe Justice Department has yet again offered accommodations to House Democrats, and I am glad Chairman Nadler \u2014 for the first time in months \u2014 has finally met them at the negotiating table,\u201d Collins\u2019s statement says. He further points out that today\u2019s \u201cgood faith provision\u201d from the administration further \u201cdebunks claims\u201d that the White House is stonewalling Congress, which intelligence committee chairman and California Democrat Adam Schiff\u2019s successful negotiations with the Justice Department \u201calready showed\u201d. Collins now asks: \u201cIs the chairman [Nadler] prepared to rescind his baseless recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt, or do House Democrats still plan to green light lawsuits against the attorney general and former White House counsel tomorrow?\u201d And Nadler\u2019s news release also includes some handy background: On April 19, the House judiciary committee issued a subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and key underlying evidence. The Department of Justice refused to comply with the May 1 deadline for production of those materials. Although the Committee made repeated attempts to negotiate for the materials responsive to the subpoena, the Department cut off negotiations on the evening of May 7. On May 8, the committee voted to recommend that the House hold Attorney General [William] Barr in contempt of Congress. On May 24, Chairman Nadler wrote to White House Counsel and the Attorney General to remind them that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the President\u2019s stated intent to block all congressional subpoenas, the Committee also remains prepared to meet with the Department and the White House to ascertain if an acceptable accommodation can be reached.\u201d Here\u2019s Nadler\u2019s full news statement: Today, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) announced that he had reached an agreement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) over obtaining key evidence in the Mueller Report related to possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. Chairman Nadler made the following statement: \u201cI am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has agreed to begin complying with our committee\u2019s subpoena by opening Robert Mueller\u2019s most important files to us, providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess whether the President and others obstructed justice or were engaged in other misconduct. The Department will share the first of these documents with us later today. All members of the Judiciary Committee\u2014Democrats and Republicans alike\u2014will be able to view them. These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the Special Counsel. \u201cGiven our conversations with the Department, I will hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now. We have agreed to allow the Department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement. If the Department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything that we need, then there will be no need to take further steps. If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies. It is critical that Congress is able to obtain the information we need to do our jobs, ensuring no one is above the law and bringing the American public the transparency they deserve.\u201d Barr escapes criminal contempt vote Attorney general William Barr has avoided the risk of being held in criminal contempt for blocking congressional demands for key evidence from Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. Weeks spent threatening to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in criminal contempt for defying subpoenas over the full Mueller report and underlying materials clearly coincided with intense negotiations behind the scenes. This has now resulted in the beginning of greater cooperation between the DoJ and leading House Democrats, with previously-secret Mueller materials being handed over for House judiciary committee members to review in private, from this afternoon. That coincides with an important hearing where former White House counsel under Richard Nixon, John Dean, and other former US attorneys of more recent vintage, will testify to explain how prosecutors go through the process or investigating and taking action over obstruction of justice and abuse of power. In recent days, House Democrats had talked of going to court to enforce the subpoenas, rather than holding Barr in contempt anyway. But there is now discussion underway in the media about whether there will still be a vote on the floor tomorrow to hold Barr and McGahn in \u201ccivil contempt\u201d - which would be more of a gesture at this stage. Nadler said on Monday that the House is still expected to consider a resolution tomorrow authorizing the committee to enforce its subpoenas in federal court. His statement added that some enforcement action may be necessary to obtain documents and testimony outside the scope of today\u2019s agreement with DoJ, including testimony from McGahn. DoJ agrees to hand over Mueller evidence to House judiciary committee Jerry Nadler says the committee\u2019s reached a deal with the department of justice to obtain \u201ckey evidence\u201d from Mueller\u2019s files on obstruction of justice, in relation to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the US 2016 presidential election and Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler has issued a statement about the small but important concession the DoJ has just made in acquiescing to Dems\u2019 demands for more Mueller materials. Here\u2019s a useful tweet: House investigation jumps forward House judiciary chairman and New York Democrat Jerry Nadler just announced: \u201cI am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has agreed to begin complying with our committee\u2019s subpoena by opening Robert Mueller\u2019s most important files to us, providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess\u201d whether Trump obstructed. This news just tweeted by the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake. Mike Pence praises Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong stand\u201d on Mexico Potus just retweeted Veep (the Veep, not Veep, sadly) from yesterday, #ICYMI. Mike Pence posted: \u201c.@POTUS\u2019 strong stand got Mexico to do things they have never done before: 6,000 National Guard at their southern border, immigration checkpoints throughout Mexico &amp; allow ALL illegal immigrants from Central America to remain in Mexico pending their asylum claims..\u201d House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Mueller report We\u2019ll live stream the hearing on this blog when it gets underway at 2PM local time in Washington. The star witness is former attorney, Nixon White House counsel and inmate, present day author and political pundit - John Dean, whom Donald Trump has decided is a \u201csleazebag\u201d. But there are also three other witnesses today. Joyce White Vance is a former US attorney for the northern district of Alabama and a University of Alabama law professor and MSNBC contributor. She explained on Twitter last night that her job today is to help people understand how DoJ prosecutors assess evidence and take action. Leaning more to the right, there\u2019ll be legal scholar John Malcolm, vice president for the institute for constitutional government, which is under the umbrella of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, in Washington, DC. He\u2019s also chairman of the criminal law practice group of the Federalist Society. And, may the fourth (chair) be with her, the former US attorney for the eastern district of Michigan and professor at University of Michigan law school, Barbara McQuade. Joyce White Vance tweeted what she called a \u201chandy link\u201d to the summary Mueller wrote for each volume of his report. But, appointed by the Obama administration, her pinned tweet says this: Jon Swaine\u2019s on CNN now, folks, talking about his story today. If you happen to have sight of CNN, on your phone, in your news room, veterinary\u2019s waiting room, airport departure lounge or, you know, actual lounge (if the latter, congratulations on having the day off/working from home/being retired), keep an eye out for Guardian senior reporter Jon Swaine. He\u2019s going on air any moment (which we literally expect to be any moment, but, in CNN-speak, \u201cany moment\u201d could mean any time in the next hour...or more), to discuss his exclusive story today about: The company part-owned by Jared Kushner that received $90m from unknown offshore investors since 2017. You can read the full version here. And there\u2019s a very lively debate going on about it on Twitter. US Supreme Court rejects challenge to gun silencer regulations As the Supreme Court\u2019s June decision flurry continues, the bench announced it\u2019s rejecting a challenge to federal regulation of gun silencers. It is just a matter of days since a gunman used one in the shooting rampage that killed 12 people, mostly local government workers, in their workplace in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The justices did not comment on Monday in turning away appeals from two Kansas men who were convicted of violating federal law regulating silencers, the AP writes. The men argued that the constitutional right under the second amendment \u201cto keep and bear arms\u201d includes silencers. Kansas, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina, Texas and Utah urged in a filing that the justices hear the appeal, saying the court should affirm that the Second Amendment protects \u201csilencers and other firearms accessories.\u201d The Trump administration asked the court to stay out of the case and leave the convictions in place. The administration, meanwhile, has done next to nothing to advance greater gun control in the US. Police are still trying to determine the motive for massacre in Virginia, after a worker who had just resigned opened fire in a municipal building on May 31, armed with two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines. The gunman (whose identity we prefer not to remind you of here) was killed in a lengthy shoot-out with law enforcement. Mexico\u2019s border pact With US bought time Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Monday morning that the border agreement it struck to avert US tariffs bought Mexico time to show that it can reduce the flood of Central America migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border. Ebrard said the immigration agreement delayed for now the Trump administration\u2019s demand that Mexico accept becoming a safe third country, which would require that migrants setting foot in its territory request asylum there, instead of in the US, the Wall Street Journal reports this morning. Mexico persuaded US officials to give the measures time, he said, and agreed that if they fail to reduce the flood of migrants heading north, the sides would meet again to discuss further US proposals. Under the agreement reached late on Friday, the government of Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador agreed to speed up the reception of migrants returned from the US to await their US asylum hearings in Mexico and to speed up the deployment of National Guard troops in border areas to support Mexican migration officials. The Supreme Court on Monday declined to wade into the contentious question of to what extent detainees held by the US military at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, can seek their release, turning away an appeal by a Yemeni-born man held since 2001. The court refused to consider an appeal by Yemeni detainee Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alwi, who was captured in Pakistan in December 2001 and detained without charge ever since, Reuters reports this hour. The government has said al Alwi was involved in fighting against US and allied forces in Afghanistan and was closely linked with the Islamic militant group al Qaeda. After the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on America, the US began a long-running military campaign in Afghanistan targeting al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks, and the Taliban-led government that sheltered the group. Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court\u2019s four liberals, issued a statement saying that the court should weigh in on the issue at some point to decide \u201cwhether, in light of the duration and other aspects of the relevant conflict, Congress has authorized and the Constitution permits continued detention.\u201d Al Alwi \u201cfaces that real prospect that he will spend the rest of his life in detention based on his status as an enemy combatant a generation ago,\u201d Breyer added. Al Alwi, who was born in 1977 and is in his early 40s, has said he should be released, in part because the US conflict in Afghanistan has \u201ceffectively ended.\u201d His lawyers have said that the authority of the United States to hold him has \u201cunraveled\u201d because of the length of the conflict. In a 2018 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected his claims. Noticeable by his absence - Robert Mueller Okay, John Dean\u2019s interesting. His testimony this afternoon before the House judiciary committee may even be illuminating and important. But there\u2019s still an air of House Dems marking time until they can, hopefully, lasso Robert Mueller himself to appear on the Hill and answer questions about his report, published mid-April. Mueller can say all he wants that \u201cit\u2019s all in the report\u201d but that cry sounds less noble than plaintive when there are still so many unanswered questions, redactions, secret underlying material and puzzling perspectives out there. If by \u201call in the report\u201d he means \u201cread between the lines\u201d, which was kind of what his little press conference (no Q &amp; A) was like last month, it shows all the more why he needs to submit to questioning by lawmakers. House anti-trust sub-committee chairman David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, told CNN on Sunday, in explaining why Mueller hasn\u2019t been dragged in yet: \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re doing this right....we want to be respectful of the special counsel....if that doesn\u2019t work, obviously we\u2019ll compel his attendance.\u201d Watergate star witness John Dean says he\u2019ll be providing a House panel \u201csome context\u201d and comparison between investigations during Nixon\u2019s administration and that of Donald Trump, the AP writes. He told CNN he\u2019ll tell the House judiciary committee on Monday, in the hearing commencing in Washington at 2PM, \u201chow strikingly like Watergate what we\u2019re seeing now, as reported in the Mueller report, is.\u201d Dean says he\u2019ll focus on the question of obstruction of justice in his testimony. Special counsel Robert Mueller investigated Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and contacts with Trump\u2019s campaign. Mueller did not reach a determination on whether Trump tried criminally to obstruct the probe by taking actions such as firing FBI Director James Comey. Mueller said charging the president with a crime was \u201cnot an option\u201d because of federal rules. Dean tells CNN that Comey\u2019s firing \u201cwas certainly not dissimilar from some of the actions Nixon took.\u201d In 1973, Nixon ordered attorney general Elliot Richardson to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox, but Richardson refused and resigned. Trump repeatedly called Mueller\u2019s probe a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Top Democratic leaders may be in no rush to launch an impeachment inquiry but the hearing today is the first in a series on Mueller\u2019s report. John Wesley Dean III served as White House counsel to Nixon from July 1970 until he was fired in April 1973. He captivated the attention of Americans, though, with his televised testimony in June 1973 before the Senate Watergate Committee, the New York Times wrote in 2018. Mr. Dean sat at a table \u2014 in a tan suit and signature horn rim glasses, his wife, Maureen, behind him \u2014 and told the senators that Nixon was directly involved in the Watergate cover-up. He was one of the first officials in the Nixon administration to speak out. Mr. Dean was worried he was being set up by his former boss to take the blame for the June 1972 break-in by five men at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington. Indeed, the White House called him the cover-up\u2019s \u201cmastermind,\u201d the NYT reported in June 1973. For his part, Mr. Dean has long maintained his colleagues sought to make him a scapegoat. He served a reduced sentence, in return for helping the FBI investigation into the scandal and cover-up, of four months in prison after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice. Dean was also disbarred. Trump calls Nixon counsel John Dean \u201csleazebag attorney\u201d Is the president just rattled about the House judiciary committee hearing today or is he reasonably criticizing what could be quite the showboat event on Capitol Hill today? White House counsel John Dean turned on his boss during the Watergate scandal that eventually led to Nixon\u2019s downfall (and Dean\u2019s imprisonment). He testified in devastating form before the Senate Watergate Committee in June 1973, having warned Nixon, amid presidential lying and abuse of power, that there was \u201ca cancer growing on the presidency\u201d. Fast forward 46 years and Dean is a CNN commentator and is frequently critical of the current occupant of the White House. He\u2019ll be testifying again this afternoon in the committee\u2019s \u201cexplanation session\u201d about the Mueller report. On Sunday evening, Trump tweeted his rage that the Democrats continue to investigate him, saying, in part: \u201cThey are even bringing in @CNN sleazebag attorney John Dean. Sorry, no Do Overs - Go back to work!\u201d Here\u2019s the tweet - and there are some choice responses: Before we continue with coverage of the breathless anticipation (no less breathless from the White House) of John Dean on Capitol Hill this afternoon and the ongoing US-Mexico immigration mess, we must draw your attention to our scoop this morning. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine reports today that a real estate company part-owned by Jared Kushner has received $90m in foreign funding from an opaque offshore vehicle since he entered the White House as a senior adviser to his father-in-law Donald Trump. Investment has flowed from overseas to the company, Cadre, while Kushner works as an international envoy for the US, according to corporate filings and interviews. The money came through a vehicle run by Goldman Sachs in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven that guarantees corporate secrecy. Kushner, who is married to Trump\u2019s elder daughter Ivanka, kept a stake in Cadre after joining the administration, while selling other assets. His holding is now valued at up to $50m, according to his financial disclosure. You can read his full report here. The president is hopping mad with the New York Times over its coverage of his immigration agreement with Mexico. Read more about it in our story today. Our Oliver Milman reports that: Trump returned to the offensive...accusing the New York Times of \u201csick journalism\u201d for a report, which said key components of the deal, announced on Friday, had been agreed for months. The president is tweeting this morning about the mysterious Mexico \u2018deal\u2019 over tariffs and quashing migration flows into the United States, but it\u2019s still as clear as mud and as tricky to navigate as a swamp. \u201cWe have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico\u2019s Legislative body!..\u201d goes Tweet One. Followed by this: \u201c....We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, Tariffs will be reinstated!\u201d Happy Monday morning, here we go with our daily US politics live blog. What\u2019s on the agenda today in Washington and beyond? If you relish reading Nixon, Watergate, Trump and Mueller in the same sentence, it\u2019s likely to be a good day for you. Former White House counsel John Dean, a key witness during the Watergate scandal that led to Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation, testifies today before the House Judiciary Committee at a hearing entitled Lessons from the Mueller report: presidential obstruction and other crimes. It\u2019s a \u2018splain session. 2PM ET. Donald Trump has just referred to Dean as \u201csleazebag attorney\u201d. There is a close watch on for any concrete details emerging from the White House, the State Department of the Department of Homeland Security about exactly what measures Mexico might be taking to stem the arrival of migrants from Central America at the US-Mexico border. This following the hiatus in Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico from today over the issue. The threat has apparently not gone away and is just on hold. Most of the leading Democratic candidates for the 2020 nomination will continue their campaigns in Iowa today after they saturated the state at the weekend searching for early support to help them stand out in the early caucus state. Things got quite chaotic on Sunday with 19 candidates falling over each other in Cedar Rapids. Amy Klobuchar can enjoy splendid breathing room today in New Hampshire.",
