Speaking in response to the seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker by Iranian authorities, Richards told BBC radio\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe fact is, for whatever reason, our government has invested relatively little against the threat and the risks that we face, particularly more and more in the longer term.\u201d The former first sea lord, Lord West of Spithead, told Sky News that the navy had \u201ctoo few ships\u201d to escort merchant vessels in dangerous waters. Concerns about an overstretched military are echoed in the committee\u2019s report, which warns that the UK\u2019s defence funding model is broken and that the UK\u2019s long-term plan for defence, established in 2015, is unaffordable within the budget allocated. The government is accused of persistently failing to provide enough money to fund its ambitions for defence capabilities and the Ministry of Defence is criticised for struggling to manage its budget effectively. \u201cStrong arguments have been advanced that it is not enough to spend 2% of GDP on defence, in light of both the scale and range of threats to the UK and the costs involved in keeping pace with rapid technological change,\u201d the report recounts. \u201cYet a recent Defence Committee report found that Ministry of Defence expenditure fell from 2.4% of GDP in 2010/11 to 1.8% in 2017/18.\u201d The report also suggests tensions between two key Whitehall departments need to be resolved if the UK is to meet its defence objectives. \u201cThere is an urgent need for the MoD to be supported by the Treasury in its efforts to harness new technology and innovation while maintaining sufficient numbers of soldiers, sailors, pilots and more conventional equipment,\u201d the report adds. Instead it finds that too often policy and budgetary decisions are left hanging. \u201cThe national security landscape is changing more quickly than the current cycle of five-yearly reviews of UK national security can accommodate, suggesting that a form of interim review is needed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will be tested by a major international crisis in his first days as prime minister, senior military figures and politicians have warned, after Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in a move that raised tensions in the Gulf to new heights. Johnson, who is expected to win the race to succeed Theresa May as Tory leader and be installed as the new prime minister on Wednesday, was kept informed about the spiralling crisis on Saturday by his rival for the top job, Jeremy Hunt, whom he is expected to reappoint as foreign secretary. The former first sea lord Admiral Lord West, writing in the Observer, has said the British government should have done more to protect UK ships in the Gulf in recent days and suggests those responsible for such decisions were distracted by the race for No 10. Under a new prime minister, he says, the government must now focus on the crisis or risk a descent into war. \u201cThis crisis has developed as the eyes of our political establishment have been focused on the election of a new prime minister,\u201d West says. \u201cWhoever wins is going to have to face a major international crisis as soon as he is in post. It cannot be ignored because of Brexit.\u201d He adds: \u201cThere are very real risks of a miscalculation or foolhardy action leading to war.\u201d Writing on theguardian.com, Alistair Burt, a former Foreign Office minister with responsibility for the Middle East, says the new prime minister already had enough problems to contend with, but now has \u201ca fully formed international crisis sitting in the in-tray marked Iran\u201d. On Saturday, Hunt summoned Tehran\u2019s top diplomat in London, and warned UK ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz, after Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards seized the British-flagged tanker off the country\u2019s coast and took it to one of its main military ports on Friday. The foreign secretary said he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to express \u201cextreme disappointment\u201d over Iran\u2019s actions, and vowed to protect UK ships during the crisis. On Saturday night, Hunt insisted the tanker, the Stena Impero, had been seized in Omani waters in \u201cclear contravention of international law\u201d, and condemned the move as \u201ctotally and utterly unacceptable\u201d. \u201cIt raises very serious questions about the security of British shipping, and indeed international shipping, in the strait of Hormuz,\u201d he said. Hunt had promised a robust response if the tanker was not released, but said the government was not contemplating military action. On Saturday night it was reported that Hunt is to use a Commons statement on Monday to announce a package of diplomatic and economic measures, including possible asset freezes, against the regime. Government sources said the timing of Iran\u2019s action, just before a change of prime minister, meant it was now almost certain that Hunt would stay as foreign secretary if, as expected, Johnson is declared the winner of the Tory leadership contest on Tuesday. One former minister said it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d for a new foreign secretary to be brought it in at such a time. However, doubts remained in Whitehall about the ability of Johnson and his new team to handle the crisis. Johnson was strongly criticised when, as foreign secretary, he made false remarks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Iran, which her family say worsened her plight. The former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett said it was a dangerous moment: \u201cThis is a critical test for the new prime minister which will put him and his team on their mettle.\u201d The government\u2019s emergency committee, Cobra, met on Saturday afternoon to discuss the crisis \u2013 the second such gathering in under 24 hours. It is understood that, while Johnson was not due to be briefed, as he is not a member of the government, Hunt kept him abreast of developments. Iran\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, the country\u2019s senior diplomat in London, was also summoned to the Foreign Office. Iran\u2019s capture of the tanker and its 23 crew members came two weeks after Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker, the Grace 1, off Gibraltar, on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria in violation of an EU embargo, and just hours after authorities in Gibraltar announced that they would extend their custody of the vessel. The Stena Impero\u2019s owners said the tanker had been taken to Bandar Abbas, one of Iran\u2019s main military bases, and was carrying \u201c23 seafarers of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality\u201d. The crew were said on Saturday night to be in good health. The details of what happened on Friday afternoon remained unclear. Iran\u2019s official news agency has said the ship was seized after hitting a fishing boat. A spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards said it was being escorted by a UK military vessel at the time, which tried to stop Iran diverting the tanker to its coast. The defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said a Royal Navy frigate had been an hour from the scene when Iranian forces took control of the Stena Impero. The tanker was in Omani waters at the time, she told Sky News. The ship\u2019s owners have said it was in international waters, complying with all laws and regulations, when it was captured. On Saturday Britain\u2019s mission to the United Nations told the security council that the seized tanker was in Omani territorial waters when it was captured and Tehran\u2019s action \u201cconstitutes illegal interference\u201d. \u201cThe ship was exercising the lawful right of transit passage in an international strait as provided for under international law,\u201d the letter said. Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said that with the tanker at Bandar Abbas, Britain should rule out the use of force. \u201cIt\u2019s an important military port and any military options will be extremely unwise,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. On Saturday, Iran appeared to explicitly link Friday\u2019s move to the seizure of the Grace 1, which Tehran had denounced as piracy carried out on the orders of Washington. \u201cThe rule of reciprocal action is well-known in international law,\u201d Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, said. The council rarely comments on state matters, but when it does it is seen as reflecting the view of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Hunt rejected this interpretation, saying that although Tehran saw it as a \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d situation, \u201cnothing could be further from the truth\u201d. A second Liberian-flagged but British operated tanker was also detained for several hours by Iranian forces on Friday, before it was allowed to continue its voyage. Fars, a semi-official Iranian news agency, reported it was given a notice to meet environmental regulations. Around a fifth of the world\u2019s oil must pass through the strait of Hormuz, the busiest shipping lane in the world for crude tankers, and under 40km wide at its narrowest point. Tensions in the Gulf had already affected oil trading, and Friday\u2019s tanker seizures caused prices to spike.",

The document was a fake, the Vatican said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the theories,\u201d said Pietro. \u201cBut I do say this: the behaviour of the Vatican over these 36 years has been one of secrecy and lack of collaboration, and it has made me think there are leaders within the Vatican who know what happened. \u201cFrom John Paul II to Ratzinger [Pope Benedict XVI] and Pope Francis, they all know what happened. But due to this being so damaging to the image of the church, they\u2019ve been doing all they can to ensure that the truth doesn\u2019t come out.\u201d Ten days ago, two tombs at the Pontifical Teutonic cemetery in the Vatican were opened after an anonymous letter to the Orlandi family containing a photograph of a stone figure in the cemetery advised them to \u201clook where the angel is pointing\u201d. But the tombs were empty \u2013 not only of Emanuela\u2019s remains but also those of two 19th-century German princesses who had been buried there. Conspiracy theories were fuelled by a Facebook message posted by Francesca Chaouqui, a PR consultant convicted in 2016 of leaking classified Vatican documents to journalists. \u201cI told Pietro the tombs would be empty. This is my only statement on the matter,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI will not be able to add any details \u2026 until I am released from the [code of] pontifical secrecy.\u201d Yesterday it was disclosed after it had been opened that an underground space inside the Pontifical Teutonic College, which had been covered by a manhole, holds thousands of bones that appear to be from dozens of individuals, both \u201cadult and non-adult\u201d. Emanuela and Pietro\u2019s father died in 2004 without knowing what happened to his second-youngest child. Their mother, Maria, still lives inside Vatican City, the world\u2019s smallest state. \u201cMy mother is 88, and she has every faith in all I\u2019m doing,\u201d said Pietro. \u201cShe prays for me as she believes I will find out what happened to Emanuela, where she is or if she\u2019s dead, and if so, where her body is. Until we find [her remains], we must never stop hoping she\u2019s still alive.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When dusk closed in over Royal Portrush, Brooks Koepka was busy on the putting green, working to fix the stroke that has broken down on him this week. Koepka is convinced that, if he can just get it running again, he can still win this Open Championship. He is seven shots back from Shane Lowry but Koepka is not the kind who quits, especially given the heavy weather, and the heavy pressure, that Lowry is going to have to deal with on Sunday. And besides, Koepka said cold-bloodedly, he still remembers what happened \u201cthe last time Shane had the lead at Oakmont\u201d, when he blew a four-shot lead in the US Open in 2016.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at the top spot, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m looking at,\u201d Koepka said. Given how badly he has been putting, it is extraordinary he is still in contention for it. On Saturday he missed a string of mid-range putts, the costliest of them at the 13th, where he dropped a shot for the first time in 27 holes, and 15th. At that point he had dropped to seven under and his chances were fading fast but Koepka is tough as they come and he finished his round with back-to-back birdies, the second of them made with a 25ft putt on the 18th, and they hauled him back into it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/20/tommy-fleetwood-shane-lowry-shootout-storm-open\">Tommy Fleetwood prepares to battle Shane Lowry in shootout in the storm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Koepka is not missing by much. Most of those putts finished within inches of the hole. \u201cThere\u2019s some weeks where you just don\u2019t make anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel like good putts when they come off the blade. But they\u2019re burning the edge. That\u2019s the only thing I can say. They feel like good putts. They\u2019re all tap-ins.\u201d</p> \n<p>Koepka\u2019s Saturday partner, Justin Rose, is right there beside him on nine under. It has been a rough week for the favourites at Royal Portrush. There were 14 major winners on the wrong side of the cutline, Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and Adam Scott among them. At the end of it Rose and Koepka are the two men left nearest to Lowry who everyone knows have what it takes to win a major. That gives them a lot of self-confidence in the bad weather that is coming on Sunday, when the wind is going to be up around 35mph.</p> \n<p>\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s going to blow tomorrow,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cI need it. I need some wind, I need some rain. I need anything that can kind of go my way.\u201d Rose agreed with that: \u201cI think in my situation you almost need it. It offers you a little bit more hope than if it was a benign day.\u201d But he was a little more generous to the man he needs to beat than Koepka had been. \u201cThe thing is with Shane, he\u2019s got a great short game and that will stand him in good stead on a tough weather day. If there is a tough-weather-day player, it is probably him. But that still doesn\u2019t make it easy trying to win a major in conditions like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rose ground his way round the front nine in level par which, he said, was a couple of shots shy of where he wanted to be. It could have been worse. His best play came on the 4th and 7th, where he made a couple of brilliant par saves. On the 4th he had to chop his way out of the rough on to the front of the green, chip in and then make a 25ft putt, and on the 7th, playing his second out of the rough again, he rolled a lovely lag putt from 70ft to leave a tap-in. But then it all came together for him on the back nine, where he followed an eagle on the 12th with birdies on the 13th and 15th.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rose did drop a shot on the 16th, \u201cwhich is a shame because I made a mental target of getting to 10 under\u201d. He feels as if he has the angles all worked out. \u201cI never thought that I\u2019d be leading but I thought if I got to 10 under I might be four back, and the most important thing about that is it means there aren\u2019t too many guys ahead of me. So if I do play a great round of golf in tough weather, I won\u2019t have to run through a whole bunch of guys, I\u2019ve just got one or two guys to chase.

      "bodyText": "When dusk closed in over Royal Portrush, Brooks Koepka was busy on the putting green, working to fix the stroke that has broken down on him this week. Koepka is convinced that, if he can just get it running again, he can still win this Open Championship. He is seven shots back from Shane Lowry but Koepka is not the kind who quits, especially given the heavy weather, and the heavy pressure, that Lowry is going to have to deal with on Sunday. And besides, Koepka said cold-bloodedly, he still remembers what happened \u201cthe last time Shane had the lead at Oakmont\u201d, when he blew a four-shot lead in the US Open in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the top spot, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m looking at,\u201d Koepka said. Given how badly he has been putting, it is extraordinary he is still in contention for it. On Saturday he missed a string of mid-range putts, the costliest of them at the 13th, where he dropped a shot for the first time in 27 holes, and 15th. At that point he had dropped to seven under and his chances were fading fast but Koepka is tough as they come and he finished his round with back-to-back birdies, the second of them made with a 25ft putt on the 18th, and they hauled him back into it. Koepka is not missing by much. Most of those putts finished within inches of the hole. \u201cThere\u2019s some weeks where you just don\u2019t make anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel like good putts when they come off the blade. But they\u2019re burning the edge. That\u2019s the only thing I can say. They feel like good putts. They\u2019re all tap-ins.\u201d Koepka\u2019s Saturday partner, Justin Rose, is right there beside him on nine under. It has been a rough week for the favourites at Royal Portrush. There were 14 major winners on the wrong side of the cutline, Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and Adam Scott among them. At the end of it Rose and Koepka are the two men left nearest to Lowry who everyone knows have what it takes to win a major. That gives them a lot of self-confidence in the bad weather that is coming on Sunday, when the wind is going to be up around 35mph. \u201cThankfully, it\u2019s going to blow tomorrow,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cI need it. I need some wind, I need some rain. I need anything that can kind of go my way.\u201d Rose agreed with that: \u201cI think in my situation you almost need it. It offers you a little bit more hope than if it was a benign day.\u201d But he was a little more generous to the man he needs to beat than Koepka had been. \u201cThe thing is with Shane, he\u2019s got a great short game and that will stand him in good stead on a tough weather day. If there is a tough-weather-day player, it is probably him. But that still doesn\u2019t make it easy trying to win a major in conditions like that.\u201d Rose ground his way round the front nine in level par which, he said, was a couple of shots shy of where he wanted to be. It could have been worse. His best play came on the 4th and 7th, where he made a couple of brilliant par saves. On the 4th he had to chop his way out of the rough on to the front of the green, chip in and then make a 25ft putt, and on the 7th, playing his second out of the rough again, he rolled a lovely lag putt from 70ft to leave a tap-in. But then it all came together for him on the back nine, where he followed an eagle on the 12th with birdies on the 13th and 15th. Rose did drop a shot on the 16th, \u201cwhich is a shame because I made a mental target of getting to 10 under\u201d. He feels as if he has the angles all worked out. \u201cI never thought that I\u2019d be leading but I thought if I got to 10 under I might be four back, and the most important thing about that is it means there aren\u2019t too many guys ahead of me. So if I do play a great round of golf in tough weather, I won\u2019t have to run through a whole bunch of guys, I\u2019ve just got one or two guys to chase. And you just never know what kind of day they may or may not have in tough weather.\u201d As Rose said: \u201cYou never know what the leader is going to do. If a guy goes ahead and continues to play great, you tip your hat and say: \u2018Well done.\u2019\u201d Otherwise, he and Koepka will be right there behind him, waiting for their opportunity. And, as Koepka says: \u201cIn links golf all of a sudden a couple of bad bounces and you never know.\u201d Out here, he added pointedly, \u201cit can get out of control very quickly\u201d.",

This is me coming out and treating them the exact way they treated me.\u201d Schauffele was also annoyed that one fellow player called him a cheater after the random test, which measures how springy the driver\u2019s clubface is. \u201cIt is an unsettling topic,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been called a cheater by my fellow opponents. It\u2019s all joking, but when someone yells \u2018cheater\u2019 in front of 200 people, to me it\u2019s not going to go down very well. I\u2019m cool with him, but that\u2019s not something you joke about.\u201d A spokesman for the R&amp;A did not comment directly on Schauffele\u2019s criticisms but added: \u201cWe always listen to feedback from players and have done so in this situation. We will continue to treat this as a private and confidential matter.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government is being accused of ignoring bipartisan recommendations and breaching commitments to reform the spy agency\u2019s powers as it prepares a fresh push on national security when parliament resumes on Monday. Labor and Centre Alliance fear the government is set to ignore advice to improve scrutiny of proposed new powers for the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, to exclude citizens from Australia and to phase out Asio\u2019s detention powers. By pushing ahead on two key bills without fully implementing recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, the government has set a test for Labor: to capitulate, despite having reached agreement on improvements with Coalition MPs, or stand up to Dutton at the risk of being accused of harming national security. When parliament returns on Monday, the lower house will debate new laws to punish trespass on agricultural land, the repeal of legislation facilitating medical evacuations from offshore detention, an extension of Asio\u2019s powers to detain and question people without charge and creation of a power for Dutton to block Australians from re-entering Australia on security grounds. Labor and Centre Alliance support the intent of the temporary exclusion order bill but believe the Coalition has failed to fully implement 11 of 18 recommendations of the PJCIS to include safeguards in the bill. The government has rejected a call from the committee \u2013 which is chaired by its own MP Andrew Hastie \u2013 that a judge, retired judge or a senior member of the administrative appeals tribunal should issue an exclusion order, not the minister. Instead, the government has proposed a right of review of the home affair\u2019s minister\u2019s decision to bar an Australian from returning for up to two years \u2013 but the decision can only be overturned if it is \u201clegally flawed\u201d. That would leave the discretion in Dutton\u2019s hands to decide if \u201creasonable grounds\u201d exist to conclude allowing an Australian to return to Australia would assist a terrorist organisation. In the Asio bill, the government has proposed extending the spy agency\u2019s power to detain people for up to seven days and question them for up to 24 hours. The powers are due to expire in September 2019 and the bill proposes a further 12-month extension. In May 2018 the PJCIS recommended that Asio keep its powers of compulsory questioning but lose powers of compulsory detention after two independent national security legislation monitors in 2012 and 2016 concluded they were \u201cnot necessary to prevent or disrupt a terrorist act\u201d. Senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia that Centre Alliance wants the government to tender advice that the exclusion order bill is constitutional and improve the oversight regime for issuing and reviewing exclusion orders. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a severe thing to prevent an Australian returning to Australia,\u201d he said. Patrick suggested there was a \u201cworkable solution\u201d if the government adopted the PJCIS recommendations. Labor\u2019s position is also to support the bill if the recommendations are adopted, but the issue will be further considered at shadow cabinet before parliament resumes. On the Asio bill, Patrick said the government has had \u201cplenty of time\u201d to implement recommendations to repeal or replace the detention powers. He said Centre Alliance would \u201csignal \u2026 discomfort\u201d but stopped short of committing to block the extension. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t support this sort of extension being moved again,\u201d Patrick said, suggesting Centre Alliance could support the initial 12-month extension but then draw the line at a further extension before September 2020, when he and Stirling Griff will still be in the parliament. The Law Council president, Arthur Moses, said Asio\u2019s questioning and detention powers are \u201csome of the most far-reaching and extraordinary powers granted to any intelligence organisation in the world\u201d, allowing it to \u201csecretly and immediately detain persons whether or not they are terrorist suspects\u201d. \u201cQuestioning and detention warrants are excessive, unnecessary, and have not been used once in their 13-year history,\u201d he said. \u201cThese powers should not be extended for another 12 months without clear justification.\u201d Introducing the Asio bill on 4 July, Dutton told the lower house it would ensure Asio \u201cretains its strong counterterrorism capabilities while the government progresses more detailed reforms to [its] questioning and detention powers\u201d. The explanatory memorandum for the exclusion order bill suggests it is necessary to ensure that if Australians return from overseas conflict zones authorities have forewarning and can set conditions on their return. \u201cThe bill does not permanently prohibit entry into Australia, and a person is entitled to be issued a return permit if they apply,\u201d it said. The government\u2019s decision to press on with both bills marks a further decline in bipartisanship on national security since February when Labor says it was forced to issue a minority report against the \u201clikely unconstitutional\u201d extension of Dutton\u2019s ability to strip terrorists of Australian citizenship.",

His remit is as narrow as a skin cell but as wide as the concept of pain itself.</p> <p>He has a floor full of scientists, youngsters with niche and competing interests, international and Australian, sitting in an open-plan office at the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre.</p> <p>After de-barbing the jellyfish, they say it is easy to do the same to spiders, snakes and rockfish. They are working on improving the effectiveness of chemotherapy on tumours. They think they have a way to dull chronic pain \u2013 in mice at least. Down the line, they hope to work on endometriosis. They are swirling venom up in test tubes in one room, growing spinal cords in another.</p> <p>Neely\u2019s team can pitch him anything as long as it involves genetics, improves human health, and he finds it \u201cinteresting\u201d. This means they can pitch him anything.</p> <p>\u201cI have been studying pain since 2003,\u201d he says. \u201cThe genetics of pain, the molecular mechanisms.

The insect has 14,000 individual genes, and until then, he says \u201cthe vast majority were not tested for pain\u201d. He found 600. Two-thirds were also in humans. \u201cThat was the first step.\u201d</p> <p>The way Neely\u2019s team created the box jellyfish antidote is simple, once you understand it. They began with human skin cells, floating in test tubes, then added toxic jellyfish venom.</p> <p>\u201cWe have human cells, we add venom and it kills them all,\u201d Neely says. \u201cThat\u2019s our starting point. Total death.\u201d</p> <p>Then with Crispr, they slice and dice the cells, cutting out genes at random. This creates a soup of cells, all with different properties. Some are lacking X, some lacking Y.</p> <p>\u201cNow we have this big mixture of cells. Then we add our venom, and not everything dies. We keep adding more venom, and not everything dies. Whatever doesn\u2019t die we collect, so it\u2019s a really easy screen.\u201d</p> <p>It is trial and error; natural selection sped up. \u201cNow [in our new research] we are doing more complex situations,\u201d Neely says. \u201cNot just life and death.</p> <p>\u201cBut this one was great. We picked out all the cells that had resistance, sequenced them and identified which genes were knocked out.\u201d</p> <p>In the results, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09681-1\">published in Nature Communications</a>, the researchers found the resistant cells didn\u2019t have any cholesterol in them. If the skin cells don\u2019t die, then the sting doesn\u2019t hurt \u2013 or enter the bloodstream. Their antidote applies a mix of hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements to skin that draws the cholesterol out of the cells. The venom can\u2019t puncture it.</p> <p>It\u2019s so simple it can go on as a spray. The next step is to find a government to back it, and the required regulatory testing. They are cautious. It has not been tested on humans, and they want to be sure that stopping the pain also stops the other symptoms that affect the heart.</p> <p>But Neely can\u2019t see any immediate reason why blocking the venom on the skin wouldn\u2019t then block its progress to the heart. He wants it to go through the rigorous testing process.</p> <p>Since the antidote doesn\u2019t require an injection, or anything similarly invasive, it could be available quickly. \u201cIf, after the testing, you told me it was definitely OK,\u201d says Neely, \u201cwe could have it for people in a month.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018It cures the neuropathic pain\u2019</h2> <p>For Neely, this is just the beginning. The bare process \u2013 edit genes, test for resistance, collect \u2013 is easily replicable across the whole human body. His team is scurrying into different areas, united by the one goal, broadly, of a pain-free Australia.</p> <p>The same principle is being applied to cancer. Neely and his team are trying to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy \u2013 minimising its harmful impact on good cells, maximising its ability to kill tumours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/28/scientists-find-genetic-mutation-that-makes-woman-feel-no-pain\">Scientists find genetic mutation that makes woman feel no pain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They collected 40 of the most commonly used cancer drugs, applied them to a mix of Crispr-edited cells, and saw which ones were resistant and which ones responded.</p> <p>\u201cLots of times what happens is that chemotherapy wears off after a while, you get resistance to it,\u201d explains Neely. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to map all the different ways cells can be resistant to chemotherapy.\u201d</p> <p>Neely speaks with footnotes. He peppers every sentence with references and tributes \u2013 to his team, to other researchers. Each sentence starts sprouting tangents, to bring others and their ideas into the story.</p> <p>They have tested more venoms, he says, waving his hands to different parts of the office. \u201cRaymond has done assassin bug and centipede \u2026 We have a plate of 96 venoms that we are testing right now.

      "bodyText": "The idea came to Dr Greg Neely after the fruit flies. In May, the Sydney-based scientist and his team of 22 announced they had potentially cured the sting of the box jellyfish, the most venomous creature in the world, whose toxins cause excruciating pain as a best-case scenario, and cardiac arrest as the worst. It was a simple but groundbreaking technique, using the latest in genetics technology \u2013 Crispr, the gene-editing tool that allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA. The process is fascinating and the implications sprawl across all areas of human health. Neely\u2019s lab is expanding and looking at a grab bag of human ailments, from cancer to chronic pain. The Canadian-born professor\u2019s field is functional genomics \u2013 which is to say, anything to do with genes \u2013 with a focus on human health \u2013 which is to say, everything. His remit is as narrow as a skin cell but as wide as the concept of pain itself. He has a floor full of scientists, youngsters with niche and competing interests, international and Australian, sitting in an open-plan office at the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre. After de-barbing the jellyfish, they say it is easy to do the same to spiders, snakes and rockfish. They are working on improving the effectiveness of chemotherapy on tumours. They think they have a way to dull chronic pain \u2013 in mice at least. Down the line, they hope to work on endometriosis. They are swirling venom up in test tubes in one room, growing spinal cords in another. Neely\u2019s team can pitch him anything as long as it involves genetics, improves human health, and he finds it \u201cinteresting\u201d. This means they can pitch him anything. \u201cI have been studying pain since 2003,\u201d he says. \u201cThe genetics of pain, the molecular mechanisms. How pain happens, and how it is regulated \u2013 with the idea of helping people.\u201d In 2010, Neely used fruit flies to discover 400 new genes, present in humans, that were responsible for feeling pain. The insect has 14,000 individual genes, and until then, he says \u201cthe vast majority were not tested for pain\u201d. He found 600. Two-thirds were also in humans. \u201cThat was the first step.\u201d The way Neely\u2019s team created the box jellyfish antidote is simple, once you understand it. They began with human skin cells, floating in test tubes, then added toxic jellyfish venom. \u201cWe have human cells, we add venom and it kills them all,\u201d Neely says. \u201cThat\u2019s our starting point. Total death.\u201d Then with Crispr, they slice and dice the cells, cutting out genes at random. This creates a soup of cells, all with different properties. Some are lacking X, some lacking Y. \u201cNow we have this big mixture of cells. Then we add our venom, and not everything dies. We keep adding more venom, and not everything dies. Whatever doesn\u2019t die we collect, so it\u2019s a really easy screen.\u201d It is trial and error; natural selection sped up. \u201cNow [in our new research] we are doing more complex situations,\u201d Neely says. \u201cNot just life and death. \u201cBut this one was great. We picked out all the cells that had resistance, sequenced them and identified which genes were knocked out.\u201d In the results, published in Nature Communications, the researchers found the resistant cells didn\u2019t have any cholesterol in them. If the skin cells don\u2019t die, then the sting doesn\u2019t hurt \u2013 or enter the bloodstream. Their antidote applies a mix of hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements to skin that draws the cholesterol out of the cells. The venom can\u2019t puncture it. It\u2019s so simple it can go on as a spray. The next step is to find a government to back it, and the required regulatory testing. They are cautious. It has not been tested on humans, and they want to be sure that stopping the pain also stops the other symptoms that affect the heart. But Neely can\u2019t see any immediate reason why blocking the venom on the skin wouldn\u2019t then block its progress to the heart. He wants it to go through the rigorous testing process. Since the antidote doesn\u2019t require an injection, or anything similarly invasive, it could be available quickly. \u201cIf, after the testing, you told me it was definitely OK,\u201d says Neely, \u201cwe could have it for people in a month.\u201d \u2018It cures the neuropathic pain\u2019 For Neely, this is just the beginning. The bare process \u2013 edit genes, test for resistance, collect \u2013 is easily replicable across the whole human body. His team is scurrying into different areas, united by the one goal, broadly, of a pain-free Australia. The same principle is being applied to cancer. Neely and his team are trying to improve the efficiency of chemotherapy \u2013 minimising its harmful impact on good cells, maximising its ability to kill tumours. They collected 40 of the most commonly used cancer drugs, applied them to a mix of Crispr-edited cells, and saw which ones were resistant and which ones responded. \u201cLots of times what happens is that chemotherapy wears off after a while, you get resistance to it,\u201d explains Neely. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to map all the different ways cells can be resistant to chemotherapy.\u201d Neely speaks with footnotes. He peppers every sentence with references and tributes \u2013 to his team, to other researchers. Each sentence starts sprouting tangents, to bring others and their ideas into the story. They have tested more venoms, he says, waving his hands to different parts of the office. \u201cRaymond has done assassin bug and centipede \u2026 We have a plate of 96 venoms that we are testing right now. Sergey is going through and screening some of those. We got them all from Glenn King in Brisbane, who is basically the leader of venom research in Australia.\u201d He pays tribute to teams at Harvard, a lab in Melbourne run by Marco Herold (\u201cWe do the same thing. He\u2019s awesome\u201d), and a Dutch scientist, Thijn Brummelkamp, who he says devised the logic that led to screenings like this. He waves across the office again. Another member of his team is diving into the puzzle of chronic pain. \u201cLeslie, she took stem cells and differentiated them into new pain killing neurons, then transplanted them into mice, into the spinal cord. And it basically cures the neuropathic pain in one dose.\u201d It is a startling discovery. In July, his team published the results in the journal Science Advances. They identified that something similar to chronic pain \u2013 a poorly understood condition in humans \u2013 potentially affects insects too. Pain, in a simplistic way, works like a car. When you burn your hand, there are positive messages \u2013 that register pain \u2013 that travel up your spinal cord. But there are also brakes, negative messages, that soothe it. \u201cIf you slam your hand in your drawer, and you rub it, that is the negative,\u201d Neely says. \u201cAnd it dulls the pain.\u201d Fruit flies have the same brake as well, and if the insect suffers a serious injury, Neely\u2019s team discovered this could give them increased sensitivity. \u201cThe sensory nerves get overexcited and they basically over-activate the brakes and it kills the brakes. From now on in their lives, their brakes are gone and they are oversensitive.\u201d They believe this could be an evolutionary basis for chronic pain, and explain why humans suffer it. \u201c500 million years ago, chronic pain started out as a good thing; it allows you to escape future attacks. And now more recently it sucks for us.\u201d And early experiments on mice have fixed it \u2013 for six months. \u201cBecause these brakes are disappearing, we thought, let\u2019s put them back and see if we can cure pain. \u201cWe take stem cells and turn them into brakes, put them back in the spinal cord and it cures chronic pain.\u201d One injection removes chronic pain for at least six months. They are limited from testing that for longer, due to ethical constraints. \u201cWe now have a grant from the New South Wales government to develop that for humans within three years. That\u2019s a pretty cool new pain therapy.\u201d The possibilities spool out from this. \u201cOne person in my lab just asked if they can start spending time on figuring out the best way to research endometriosis,\u201d Neely says. He told them the first step is to figure out a good, scientifically rigorous gene test. \u2018He\u2019s leading the world\u2019 His peers agree that Neely\u2019s work is cutting-edge. The methodology is so clever it generates a kind of excitement. Prof Mark Hutchinson from the University of Adelaide is a fellow expert in pain, and says the screens Neely is doing are \u201camazing\u201d. \u201cGreg is one of Australia\u2019s top pain scientists,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no doubt he is leading the world in this space \u2026 it\u2019s amazing.

Many do it for non-religious and non-therapeutic reasons. Due to different tracking measures and non-uniform reporting of newborn circumcisions, the prevalence is difficult to measure accurately. One American <a href=\"https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb126.pdf\">healthcare agency report in 2012 </a>found that circumcisions had dropped from around 60% in 2000 to 54.5% in 2009.</p> <p>Madison Zaliski, 26, gave birth to her son in Arkansas eight months ago.

      "bodyText": "The media officer of one of the UK\u2019s top medical schools doesn\u2019t realise she hasn\u2019t muted herself as she puts me on hold. She sniggers with her colleague as she passes on my request \u2013 to speak to an expert on male circumcision \u2013 before informing me they don\u2019t have one. This foreskin flippancy festers into revulsion in some areas of popular culture. In one Sex and the City episode, Charlotte is so repelled by her lover\u2019s foreskin, she likens it to a \u201cshar-pei\u201d, the analogy cementing Miranda\u2019s resolve to circumcise her kids. It\u2019s written for entertainment value, but for Adam Zeldis, a 36-year-old software developer from New York, it\u2019s no laughing matter. Many men circumcised as babies \u201chave an epiphany when the cultural blinders come off\u201d, he tells the Guardian. \u201cI was a vulnerable 16-year-old when I realised how much skin was removed and that my bodily autonomy was violated.\u201d Georganne Chapin, who runs Intact America, hears about foreskin degradation often. \u201cMen call us saying their wives think it\u2019s \u2018disgusting and dirty\u2019 not to circumcise their sons. It\u2019s sad,\u201d she says. \u201cIntactivists\u201d (portmanteau of \u201cintact\u201d and \u201cactivist\u201d) are raising their voices in increasing numbers about infant male circumcision \u2013 but are they being heard? Not according to Zeldis. \u201cI felt immense loss and grief that I\u2019d never be given the chance to experience sex the way nature intended it. And nobody in society cared. It was terribly isolating.\u201d America is the western nation with the highest proportion of infant male circumcisions. Many do it for non-religious and non-therapeutic reasons. Due to different tracking measures and non-uniform reporting of newborn circumcisions, the prevalence is difficult to measure accurately. One American healthcare agency report in 2012 found that circumcisions had dropped from around 60% in 2000 to 54.5% in 2009. Madison Zaliski, 26, gave birth to her son in Arkansas eight months ago. Despite not consenting, she was \u201casked multiple times a day\u201d when he would be circumcised. \u201cMost nurses thought it was a paperwork mistake,\u201d she says. The other notable western nations circumcising baby boys are Canada and Australia. The Canadian Paediatric Society uses the figure of 31.9%, based on research conducted in 2007. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians puts Australia and New Zealand\u2019s figure at between 10% and 20%. In the UK, the National Childbirth Trust estimates 8.5% of men are circumcised. The NHS stopped paying for it in the 1940s. \u2018It creates trauma, pain and risk\u2019 Why do it? The most common response is custom: because dad did. Zeldis says this is the \u201cresponse people like my parents give when they don\u2019t really know why\u201d. The non-religious history, at least in America, comes from the Victorian myth that masturbation was dangerous because the loss of semen would weaken a boy permanently, and threaten the moral order. It was thought that circumcision would somehow prevent masturbation. The 1960s sexual revolution debunked that. Chapin\u2019s passion to end infant male circumcision came from her younger brother: \u201cI remember seeing his bloody penis and being taken back to have his urethra forcibly reopened \u2013 it sealed over as a result of his circumcision. The trauma kept returning.\u201d She lists her reasons against the practice like a scattergun: \u201cYou can\u2019t go cutting the body parts of people without consent unless it\u2019ll kill them. It creates trauma, pain and risk. It permanently alters a child\u2019s body and their sexual function and pleasure later in life. And it\u2019s a waste of medical resources \u2013 but American medicine is a money machine and if a procedure is refundable, it\u2019ll happen.\u201d I hear these reasons repeatedly from opponents of circumcision. Zeldis\u2019s adult perception of his operation is echoed in many of their stories: \u201cSomeone strapped me down and cut off part of my genitals with a clamp and knife, forever changing my sex life, for no reason. If you touch leftover tissue, it\u2019s highly sensitive \u2013 and that\u2019s the majority of what\u2019s cut off. There\u2019s no \u2018cut here\u2019 mark, so men are all left with different versions of the procedure.\u201d Those protesting against circumcision have, as of this year, fallen into two closely related camps. The first group is those keen to reframe vocabulary around \u201ccircumcision\u201d into \u201cmale genital mutilation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For six years Shamindan Kanapathi has been lying to his parents. Since 2013 the Sri Lankan refugee has been telling his mother and father he successfully made it to Australia and resettled safely in a new life. Only his siblings know that the 28-year-old has spent the entire time detained on Manus Island. \u201cI don\u2019t want [my parents] to know,\u201d Kanapathi tells Guardian Australia in Manus Island\u2019s main town of Lorengau. \u201cThey don\u2019t know much about Australia \u2026 Sometimes I take some photos and say it\u2019s of Australia. \u201cThey feel really sorry for me, and it\u2019s very hard when I speak to them; they keep asking what\u2019s happening. They ask about my future.\u201d Kanapathi is not alone. There are several refugees in Papua New Guinea maintaining the heartbreaking lie. Omar Jack was 18 when Australia sent him to Manus Island in 2013, after he fled the Darfur region of Sudan. \u201cI don\u2019t tell them because I\u2019m sure if I tell my mum about what\u2019s going on, she will never be OK. You know, mum\u2019s mum,\u201d he says. Jack is also burdened by the fact that he, the eldest son, fled Sudan with the plan to bring his family out to join him when he got to Australia. \u201cMaybe I will tell them one day, but not at this stage,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s been six years and I didn\u2019t achieve anything, not even for myself, forget about my family.\u201d \u2018Someone has to decide everything for me\u2019 Jack and Kanapathi are among the fewer than 140 refugee men still on Manus Island, detained under Australia\u2019s offshore processing regime under which thousands were sent to Papua New Guinea and Nauru in a bid to deter people from seeking asylum in Australia by boat. Now entering its seventh year, Australia\u2019s greatest modern controversy is winding down, but the loose ends left behind are devastating. In six months the PNG government intends to take control of the services for the remaining refugees. They are some of the most complex cases, stuck in tropical purgatory amid a wary local population. Manus province locals were never consulted about what they call \u201cthe project\u201d. \u201cThis place is not like other communities, Manus Island has been isolated for a long time, so it\u2019s hard for them to accept someone coming from the outside,\u201d Kanapathi says. \u201cThe thing is the Australian government always said [we] are criminals and [we] are bad people. So they\u2019ve been given a bad opinion about us before we came and got to know each other.\u201d The refugees say most people are kind to them but also describe drunken abuse and violence at the hands of locals who are jealous of the Australia-funded housing, food and healthcare, off limits to them. \u201cSomeone always tells me what time I go to eat, what time I get my tablet, someone has to decide everything for me \u2013 it\u2019s not a freedom,\u201d Kanapathi says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re in Australia \u2026 if you don\u2019t have your rights it is going to be hell for you.\u201d When Guardian Australia visits Lorengau, the mornings begin with torrential rain, soaking the wide empty streets around the central market where mostly women sell fresh produce, fish and nuts. Huge sea turtles, stripped of their shells, are spread on the grass. People pick their way around puddles and flooded drains, sit under the eaves talking or chewing betel nut. Asked what they think of the project, many shrug. \u201cThe government decided to give [Australia] the naval base,\u201d says one man. He gestures at a trio of refugee men walking across the road. \u201cThey\u2019re here now, in our community.\u201d Manusians are doing what they can to tolerate and adapt, to take the jobs not filled by hundreds of Australians, to hold on to their island culture while welcoming people from very different ones. In the market a couple of refugees stop to talk near the entrance to the fish section. A PNG man asks them to move with an air of weary tolerance. The men apologise, shift over and continue their discussion of who has left Manus recently, doing a quick headcount. Some share recent stories of locals threatening black magic against them, or of a recent rejection for US resettlement. Most of the men stay inside their rooms, sometimes for up to six days at a time, some eating just once a day, because if you eat more than that you have to find something to do with your energy, and there is nothing to do. At a small supermarket a young Afghan man sits on the edge of a fridge. He\u2019s waiting for his friend and watching the late afternoon traffic of people shopping. He was rejected for US resettlement a few years ago and now there is nothing but the daily pattern of life. Everything is the same here, he says. It doesn\u2019t change. Entering his seventh year on Manus Island, he says it\u2019s been too long, but he sounds resigned. \u2018The fabric of our society was destroyed\u2019 It has been too long for everyone in Lorengau, the town without choice. Locals talk of the days it began: with the Australian army and navy brought in to their remote town, intimidating most people from asking any questions. Then the refugees began arriving from Christmas Island, taken off boats intercepted on their way from Indonesia to seek asylum in Australia. At peak there were more than 2,000 incarcerated inside the purpose-built facility inside the Lombrum naval base, a short boat ride around the nearest headland. An epidemic of tragedy followed: mental illness, self-harm, suicides, murder, assaults and mass hunger strikes. Then in late 2017, after a brutal 24-day standoff brought the centre to a close, the men were moved closer to town and given more freedom to walk around. They live in three compounds \u2013 East Lorengau transit centre, Hillside Haus, and West Lorengau. Each is on the outskirts of town, down long dirt roads leading into thick jungle, the entrances to the centres manned by Paladin guards. They accept no visitors, and the refugees must abide by a 6pm to 6am curfew. If they want to find work, or organise travel, they must go through JDA Wokman, the logistics contractor. As numbers dwindle due to medevac transfers, Port Moresby transfers and US resettlement, authorities appear to be consolidating people into East Lorengau. Some who refused to take part in the refugee process in the early years were given negative determinations as a result, and now beg to have their claims assessed so they can apply for US resettlement. As they did while in detention, men have formed their own communities based on their homeland. \u201cWe love each other, we support each other,\u201d Jack says. \u201cEach one of us has a community and the community is our family. Sadness and happiness we are all together.\u201d They are also supported by a network of advocates in Australia, mostly older women who some of the men affectionately refer to as \u201cgrandmothers\u201d. Ben Pokarup is a burly local man from an outer island, who has helped the refugees however he can over the years. \u201cIn Manus, I think, a lot of people are full of hospitality and they sympathise with them,\u201d he says outside his home, a traditional men\u2019s hut just outside town. \u201cI was enormously sad when they were telling about [their stories], a lot of them are psychologically tormented. You \u2026 put yourself into someone else\u2019s shoes.\u201d But Pokarup says he also has concerns, including for the welfare of local women who forged relationships with some of the refugee men, had children, and are now alone. \u201cThe fabric of our Manus society was also absolutely destroyed because of these connections,\u201d he says. Hugely controversial contracts, paid by the Australian government, have also caused great division. Pokarup says Australians get paid as much as 10 times what a local earns working for a company which takes its profits back to Australia. \u201cBecause of the economic downturn of the country as a whole, the furthest islands of PNG \u2013 as I think we are \u2013 live with a lot of disadvantage,\u201d Pokarup says. \u201cWe have no other economic activity, and when Australia leaves Manus, there is hardly any tangible infrastructure left behind.\u201d Pokarup is also chairman of the Manus tourism board. He says the region\u2019s reputation was destroyed in an instant, but he hopes people will come to visit again soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think our leaders were in the right frame of mind when the project came,\u201d he says. \u201cThey shut their mouths up, and the actions Australia took were a new colonialist approach, and made some of us \u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say, angry or sad.\u201d A town under pressure Healthcare is a lightning rod for the concerns of people like Pokarup.

They occupied three of the beds for emergency, and one of the side rooms. What if one of the Manus citizens [needed it]?\u201d Lorengau\u2019s hospital is grim. Perched at the top of a hill, it is a series of worn-down, brightly painted weatherboard buildings connected by covered walkways. Hand-painted signs label the dentistry, operating theatre, dispensary and emergency rooms. The emergency department has four cupboard-sized stalls separated by thin walls and doorways covered by curtains. Every one is occupied, and people sit outside, under the covered balcony, some attached to drip stands. What this place could have done with the $2m a month Australia has given PIH. \u201cThey have their own problems to look after and you see the conditions,\u201d says Kanapathi. \u201cThe Australian government should have paid that money to the local hospital and built it up, so it would be fit for the refugees and the local people.\u201d A sign on the outskirts of Lorengau proclaims the town as \u201cthe pride of Manus\u201d and the first listed quality is \u201ca healthy mind\u201d. Last month the number of suicide attempts and acts of self-harm since the shock Australian election result reached 100. A young man set himself on fire inside his room at asylum seeker accomodation, prompting the local police to announce he would be charged with arson and attempted suicide. A national PNG newspaper published a reader\u2019s letter decrying that all this self-harm was affecting their children, so if refugees wanted to set themselves on fire, PNG could help them burn. It\u2019s quieter now in Lorengau, and the acts of self-harm have slowed. There is a wary calm among the people from very different backgrounds, thrown together through no choice of their own, but no one \u2013 refugees and locals alike \u2013 knows why these men are still here. On Friday the PNG prime minister, James Marape, demanded a timeline from Australia to end the regime \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes sporting outcomes give the impression of being written in the stars. Shane Lowry has enough to occupy his thoughts, without contemplation of becoming the latest symbol for a collective will in Ireland but, should he lift the Claret Jug at a venue deemed unsuitable for the Open Championship amid decades of civil unrest, golf will have delivered a last laugh towards bitterness. Sport\u2019s unifying qualities are such a great strength; how they were endorsed as Lowry pulled Royal Portrush to pieces.</p> \n<p>Lowry, who heads into the Open\u2019s final day holding a four-shot lead, was cheered to the rafters on Saturday in a form which demonstrated just how much this Northern Irish crowd want the man from rural County Offaly to see the job through. Although always within boundaries of respect, the genteel sport of golf took on tribal form. A wide grin barely left Lowry\u2019s face; and no wonder.</p> \n<p>The only apparent danger to him is that many of this raucous contingent seemed to think his name is already on the Jug. Just 63 shots for Lowry on Saturday, 30 of them in the last nine, was the lowest score of this tournament by two. \u201cHonestly, walking from the green to the next tee, the people are literally a yard away from you roaring in your face as loud as they can,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cIf you have to get up and hit a drive down a tight fairway, it\u2019s fairly difficult.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/20/tommy-fleetwood-shane-lowry-shootout-storm-open\">Tommy Fleetwood prepares to battle Shane Lowry in shootout in the storm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For so much of this third round, Lowry was embroiled in an almighty scrap with JB Holmes, Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood.

That he has no major title to his name made that spirit all the more admirable.</p> \n<p>Lowry needs no reminder that he also led by four with 18 to play in the US Open of 2016 at Oakmont; he duly slipped to a closing round of six over. \u201cWhen I finished, I looked at the leaderboard, four ahead, I said to [his caddie] Bo [Martin] \u2018At least I won\u2019t have to answer any questions about Oakmont, I\u2019m four ahead going into the final round of a major,\u2019\u201d said Lowry with a smile. \u201cIf I\u2019m sitting here this time tomorrow evening [having won] it will be one of the biggest things that ever happened to me, there\u2019s no denying that.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut I felt at the time in Oakmont my golf just meant a lot more to me back then than it does now.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes sporting outcomes give the impression of being written in the stars. Shane Lowry has enough to occupy his thoughts, without contemplation of becoming the latest symbol for a collective will in Ireland but, should he lift the Claret Jug at a venue deemed unsuitable for the Open Championship amid decades of civil unrest, golf will have delivered a last laugh towards bitterness. Sport\u2019s unifying qualities are such a great strength; how they were endorsed as Lowry pulled Royal Portrush to pieces. Lowry, who heads into the Open\u2019s final day holding a four-shot lead, was cheered to the rafters on Saturday in a form which demonstrated just how much this Northern Irish crowd want the man from rural County Offaly to see the job through. Although always within boundaries of respect, the genteel sport of golf took on tribal form. A wide grin barely left Lowry\u2019s face; and no wonder. The only apparent danger to him is that many of this raucous contingent seemed to think his name is already on the Jug. Just 63 shots for Lowry on Saturday, 30 of them in the last nine, was the lowest score of this tournament by two. \u201cHonestly, walking from the green to the next tee, the people are literally a yard away from you roaring in your face as loud as they can,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cIf you have to get up and hit a drive down a tight fairway, it\u2019s fairly difficult.\u201d For so much of this third round, Lowry was embroiled in an almighty scrap with JB Holmes, Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood.

Separately the Jewish Labour Movement wrote to all members of the shadow cabinet saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d that the issue of antisemitism had to be discussed at all. Mike Katz, the JLM\u2019s national chair, said it was now up to shadow cabinet members to take action. \u201cWhilst the NEC provides the administrative leadership of the party, you, the shadow cabinet, provide its political leadership. We are sorely in need of real leadership on antisemitism, having lacked any up to this point. This is your chance to lead.\u201d",

He\u2019s <em>so </em>close. He\u2019s got four strokes on his nearest challenger Tommy Fleetwood - who let\u2019s not forget shot a magnificent 66 today - and six on third-placed JB Holmes. But there\u2019s many a slip twixt Claret Jug and lip. Twenty years ago, Jean van de Velde shipped a <em>five-shot</em> third-round lead at Carnoustie, and <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2019/7/17/20697305/golf-meltdown-jean-van-de-velde-1999-british-open\">you don\u2019t need me to tell you what happened next</a>. Also, it was only three years ago when Lowry himself went into the final round of the US Open at Oakmont with a four-shot lead, only to blow it, traipsing home with a 76. And who knows what might happen when the forecast rain and wind arrives? So nothing\u2019s certain.

He wasn\u2019t too fond of the first replacement, and his driving accuracy for the first round was miserable, hitting only 43% of fairways, a poor show compared to the field average of 61%. But he tinkered on the range afterwards, and yesterday found a better fit, hitting 93% of the fairways, the best in show, especially when you compare it to the 57% average of the entire field. The ten-shot difference in his two rounds, right there. Anyway, he\u2019s found the fairway with his first drive today, leading to an opening par.

Though he\u2019ll not be matching Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington as a 21st-century back-to-back winner: he\u2019s +2.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f329de4183b7f6884f6c24fb0563cff6d12e52b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f329de4183b7f6884f6c24fb0563cff6d12e52b/0_14_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More of a mid five than a high five for Doc Redman on the 2nd green.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More of a mid five than a high five for Doc Redman on the 2nd green.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T12:32:25.389Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d32fed88f0845f89e310eed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T11:50:18.310Z\">12.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Another birdie for Portrush hero Graeme McDowell. </strong>He follows up the one he made on 11 with another at the par-five 12th.

It made him the first amateur to lead the Open since the renowned Michael Bonallack managed it back in 1968. One of Lewis\u2019s playing partners that day was the five-time winner Tom Watson, after whom he was named. Lewis finished the week tied 30th as low amateur, the Silver Medal hanging around his neck. Such a shame one won\u2019t be awarded this week, with no amateur making the cut. Anyway, Lewis has since turned pro, with a couple of victories on the European Tour to his name, both at the Portugal Masters, in 2011 and 2018. He\u2019s belatedly delivering on his early promise, with a notable upturn in form during the last couple of years.

A quite sensational performance that could well have won him the 148th Open Championship! He\u2019s so close. He\u2019s got four strokes on his nearest challenger Tommy Fleetwood - who let\u2019s not forget shot a magnificent 66 today - and six on third-placed JB Holmes. But there\u2019s many a slip twixt Claret Jug and lip. Twenty years ago, Jean van de Velde shipped a five-shot third-round lead at Carnoustie, and you don\u2019t need me to tell you what happened next. Also, it was only three years ago when Lowry himself went into the final round of the US Open at Oakmont with a four-shot lead, only to blow it, traipsing home with a 76. And who knows what might happen when the forecast rain and wind arrives? So nothing\u2019s certain. BUT if Lowry keeps his head around a course he knows so well, expect an Irishman to be crowned Champion Golfer in Ireland tomorrow evening! Lowry speaks! \u201cMy mind\u2019s a bit fuzzy! I just really enjoyed today. Obviously I played great golf. The crowd were incredible. I just felt so comfortable out there. I\u2019m hoping I feel that comfortable tomorrow, I\u2019ll have a tough 24 hours ahead. But you know what, there\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be! I\u2019ve got a four-shot lead at the Open Championship in Ireland. Tomorrow\u2019s going to be incredible, regardless of what happens.\u201d It\u2019s a new course record for Shane Lowry! It\u2019s only - only! - a 63, as his effort to match Branden Grace\u2019s major-championship record of 62, set at the Open two years ago at Birkdale, stops one dimple short of the cup. So close! Par. But so brilliant! An astonishing round that puts him 18 careful holes away from his first major title. JB Holmes makes his birdie putt, meanwhile, and he signs for a decent 69. He\u2019ll be in the penultimate group tomorrow as a result. -16: Lowry -12: Fleetwood -10: Holmes -9: Koepka, Rose Yet another wonderfully controlled iron by Lowry. He swishes it into the centre of the green. He\u2019s pin high, 30 feet to the right. One putt for a 62! Holmes knocks his second to 12 feet or so, but it\u2019s an afterthought for just about everyone in the stand. The crowd give it up for Ireland\u2019s hero as he strides up the fairway, honouring one of the great rounds in Open history. Imagine what it\u2019s going to be like if he closes this out tomorrow! Two-putt pars at 18 for Lee Westwood and Tommy Fleetwood. After a one-under 70, Westwood is almost certainly out of it at -8. Fleetwood\u2019s superb 66 ensures he\u2019ll be in the last group, and will have an opportunity to perhaps apply a little matchplay-style pressure to Lowry. But at -12, he\u2019ll be giving up four shots to his opponent from the get-go ... as things stand, anyway. Back down the fairway, Lowry is preparing to launch his last approach of the day into the green. Yep, it\u2019s three birdies in a row for Shane Lowry, and suddenly he\u2019s four clear at the top! A birdie up the last, and he\u2019ll equal Branden Grace\u2019s major-championship record of 62. This is an astonishing performance, and the gallery responds in a manner which may cause damage to either the ozone layer or the space-time continuum. Perhaps both. What a round this is! -16: Lowry (17) -12: Fleetwood (17) -9: Koepka (F), Rose (F), Holmes (17) -8: Fowler (F), Westwood (17) Lowry can do no wrong! He bumps a simply sensational wedge at 17 to three feet. He\u2019ll have that putt to go eight under for his round! And for the second hole in a row, JB Holmes sends in a shot that under any other circumstances would look incredibly good, only to find himself upstaged by the hero of the hour. Spooked, he misses his six-foot birdie putt, and drops his putter in impotent frustration. Meanwhile up on 18, a great reception for Fleetwood and Westwood, both on the green in regulation but neither within realistic birdie distance. Justin Harding\u2019s bid fell apart after the turn. After those back-to-back bogeys at 11 and 12, he dropped another strike at 15, and he ended up with a three-over 74. The South African ends the day at -3. His playing partner Cameron Smith also let things slip, following up his excellent eagle-birdie whammy at 12 and 13 with a double at 14. A level-par 71 promised so much more. He\u2019s -6. Westwood can\u2019t make his birdie putt at 17. Par. Listening to the roar from the 16th, he wears the look of a man who knows the jig is up. Fleetwood\u2019s birdie effort never looks like dropping either. His expression isn\u2019t quite so grim, but he\u2019s not exactly turning cartwheels. Back on the tee, Lowry crashes a huge drive down the left of the fairway. A good chance to get up and down from 60 yards or so. But Shane Lowry is simply unstoppable! He rolls in his birdie putt, and now he\u2019s got a three-shot lead at the top! If he pars the final two holes, he\u2019ll set a new course record. -15: Lowry (16) -12: Fleetwood (16) The leaders aren\u2019t finished, though. Lowry arrows one of the tee shots of the day at 16, to 12 feet. Calamity? What Calamity? Holmes finds the centre of the green, a very fine effort by any other metric. But the crowd only have eyes for their man. Up on 17, Fleetwood\u2019s drive bounds down the track, and he wedges to 12 feet to set up a birdie chance. Meanwhile Westwood\u2019s tee shot is pulled into thick nonsense down the left, but a mixture of adrenaline and frustration allows him to power his second into the green and leave a birdie chance of his own! ... Brooks Koepka follows up birdie at 17 by knocking in his 25-footer on 18! A strong finish that\u2019ll give the four-time major winner a huge boost going into the final round! His partner Justin Rose gets up and down from the swale for his par. -14: Lowry (15) -12: Fleetwood (16) -9: Koepka (F), Rose (15), Holmes (15) -8: Fowler (F), Westwood (16) Lowry whips a fantastic second at 15 to 12 feet. Holmes follows him in, albeit with a huge stroke of luck, a pulled approach taking a huge kick off a bank on the left back towards the flag. But Holmes can\u2019t take advantage, missing the birdie chance. No such problem for Lowry, who carefully slides a left-to-right tickler into the cup, and suddenly there\u2019s a little separation at the top of the leaderboard. Which we\u2019ll illustrate in a couple of minutes, because ... Justin Rose is furious with himself going up the last. Like McIlroy yesterday, he sends in a draw, and while his ball lands on the green, it\u2019s always going to topple off the left-hand side and down the bank. Brooks Koepka is on in two. If he can sink the 25-footer he\u2019s left himself, he\u2019ll fancy his chances of making up some ground tomorrow. Westy\u2019s not heading south quite yet! He flips a delicate chip out of the filth and across the 16th green, his ball gently resting next to the hole. He escapes with a par and remains at -8. Fleetwood meanwhile takes his two putts for par. Meanwhile no birdie for Jordan Spieth at the last, and he signs for a 69. At -7, it\u2019s probably not enough ... though the wind will be picking up tomorrow, and you never know how that may pan out. The wheels are threatening to come off the Westwood wagon. His tee shot into Calamity dribbles into the thick rough to the right of the green. A tricky up and down coming up. Fleetwood by contrast finds the dancefloor, back left. Not close to the pin, but not miles away either. Safe and sound. He\u2019d take a two-putt par here any time of any day. While Lowry took advantage of the huge stroke of luck he enjoyed off the tee, Holmes ends up making bogey from the middle of the fairway. He can\u2019t get up and down from sand. And up on 15, I wonder whether the Lee Westwood fairytale has run its course? He nearly sends a tramliner into the cup for birdie, but the ball scoots six feet past, and he pushes the one coming back. A bogey, and suddenly he\u2019s five off the pace. -13: Lowry (14) -12: Fleetwood (15) -9: Rose (17), Holmes (14) -8: Fowler (F), Koepka (17), Westwood (15) -7: Willett (F), Rahm (F), Finau (F), Spieth (17) Spieth makes another birdie, this time at 17. He\u2019s suddenly -7, and another down 18 would ask a couple of questions of the leaders coming in. Not that Lowry or Fleetwood look in the mood to buckle. Fleetwood\u2019s second into 15 kicks off down a bank to the right, but he chips up to four feet and scrambles his par. Lowry does pretty much the same from front-left of 14. This is wonderful golf. Some of Rose\u2019s good work comes undone at 16, as he yips a short par putt and drops back to -9. Back on 14, Lowry flays a disgrace of a drive deep into Puntersville down the left. He screams \u201cfore!\u201d - Kyle Stanley take note - but it still hits some poor bugger. Fortunately so, for Lowry anyway, as his ball was whistling towards some real nonsense. And now he can knock his second near the green, giving himself a chance of salvaging par. Meanwhile from the centre of the fairway, Holmes pulls his approach into sand on the left. He\u2019s been scrappy for a while, and now he\u2019s beginning to pay the price. Back-to-back bogeys are on the cards for Holmes here. A wonderful second into 14 by Fleetwood, straight over the flag. It sets up a 12-foot birdie putt. His effort looks in, but slips by on the right at the last. Then back on 13, JB Holmes finds the heart of the green, overhits his long birdie effort, and can\u2019t tidy up coming back from four feet. He slips back to -10 again. Meanwhile beard enthusiast Roger Kirkby (6.18pm) argues that Henrik Stenson won the Open in 2016 with a beard. You can see his point ... but that\u2019s not a beard. That\u2019s stubble. My blog, my rules. Sorry. It\u2019s just not happened for Brooks Koepka with the flat stick today. He leaves himself a six-foot par putt on 15, and overhits it through the left-to-right break. Bogey, and at -7 his hopes of a first Claret Jug are beginning to look a little slim. Meanwhile birdie for Tony Finau at the last - chipping in from the swale Rory McIlroy found himself last night - and amid huge cheers he signs for a 68! He\u2019s -7 going into Sunday. Poor old Jon Rahm watches in horror as a 25-foot par effort on 18 stops one dimple short of the cup. He waits as long as he can, in the hope of the grass wilting, or a small breeze nudging his ball in, but eventually has to tap home the shortest shot. Even so, that\u2019s a lovely 68. At -7 he\u2019s probably a little too far back, unless the leaders have a collective breakdown coming in. A level-par 71 for Patrick Reed, incidentally, who remains stalled at -4. Holmes leaves a chip from the swale a good ten feet short. So he does extremely well to knock in the birdie putt he\u2019s left himself, and keep pace with Lowry, who nearly drains his eagle effort but makes his own bird and regains sole ownership of the lead. Meanwhile Rose blooters a drive down 15 and eases a wedge pin high to eight feet. A great chance to move a little closer to the leading bunch ... and in it goes! -13: Lowry (12) -12: Fleetwood (13) -11: Holmes (12) -10: Rose (15) -9: Westwood (13) -8: Fowler (F), Koepka (14) Lowry\u2019s second into 12 lands pin high, 30 feet to the left. Holmes hoicks his approach another 20 feet left of Lowry, into a small depression. Meanwhile both Fleetwood and Westwood send their tee shots on the par-three 13th into the heart of the green. They\u2019re not really birdie chances, though, and the pair stay at -12 and -9 respectively. Meanwhile a birdie for Jordan Spieth at 15, and he\u2019s -6, looking to salvage his Open hopes with a strong finish. Lowry\u2019s drive at the par-five 12th flirts with the big bunker down the right of the fairway. But his ball just evades the camber that\u2019d funnel him into the trap. Holmes larrups one drown the track too. Up on the green, Fleetwood makes a fairly fuss-free birdie to join Lowry in the lead. And you may have noticed Rahm popping up on the leaderboard at -8. That\u2019s thanks to a 15-foot slider holed at 17, his third birdie in four holes. Cameron Smith follows the lead of Justin Rose, making eagle at 12 then birdie at 13. And Brooks Koepka ensures he stays in touch, responding to his first dropped shot in 27 holes by immediately bouncing back with birdie at 14!. This really is magnificent knockabout entertainment! -12: Fleetwood (12), Lowry (11) -10: Holmes (11) -9: Rose (14), Westwood (12) -8: Fowler (F), Rahm (17), Koepka (14), Smith (13) Dustin Johnson\u2019s always been just off the pace this week. A bogey at the last, and it\u2019s his second 72 of the tournament, sandwiching yesterday\u2019s 67. He\u2019s -2. Xander Schauffele parred the last couple of holes, ending up with a 69 that promised more. He\u2019s -5. Justin Harding has made back-to-back bogeys at 11 and 12 to slip to -5. And an eighth par in a row for JB Holmes, who turns down another birdie chance at 11. He\u2019s still a couple behind Lowry, who pars the hole without too much drama. -12: Lowry (11) -11: Fleetwood (11) -10: Holmes (11) -9: Rose (13), Westwood (11) -8: Fowler (F), Rahm (17) Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren both make it home in 68. They\u2019re both -6 for the week, and aren\u2019t out of this yet. Especially if the leaders come back to them. Meanwhile here\u2019s Roger Kirkby: \u201cWith a lot of facial growth on the leaderboard today, and growing up not remembering many winners with a beard, a trivia question for ya. Who was the first guy to win a major after 1960 with a beard?\u201d Funnily enough, I looked into this yesterday afternoon, with reference to the Open anyway. So please let me repeat myself. [cuts, pastes] There hasn\u2019t been a bearded winner of the Open since 1882, when Bob Ferguson took the title at St Andrews sporting an extremely wide goatee. No sides or moustache though, and a lack of hair on the upper lip might irk some purists. So with Willie Park Sr. (1875, Prestwick) similarly disqualified for lack of tache, despite having a dead sheep glued to his chin, we have to go right back to 1867, when Old Tom Morris triumphed at Prestwick with the full Santa arrangement. Jon Rahm trundles in a long birdie chance on 16. That follows birdies at 8 and 14, and all of a sudden he\u2019s -7. Andrew Putnam is up there too, with back-to-back birdies at 12 and 13. And Justin Rose whips his tee shot at the par-three 13th to eight feet, and follows up his eagle with birdie. Nothing much was happening for north Hampshire\u2019s finest, but now look! Bogey for his partner Brooks Koepka, though, his first in 27 holes, and he slips to -7. ... Justin Rose rattles in a long eagle putt on 12, while his partner Brooks Koepka finally makes another birdie. The reigning PGA champ has seen a lot of chances shave the hole this week. Pars for the -woods West- and Fleet- on 11, both passing up decent birdie chances. -12: Lowry (10) -11: Fleetwood (11) -10: Holmes (10) -9: Westwood (11) -8: Fowler (F), Koepka (12), Rose (12) But there is a way to get the ball close with the putter! Holmes snakes a delightful putt to six feet, from where he saves par. What a wonderful scramble. But he\u2019s now two off the lead, because Lowry knocks in his birdie effort - no more than the second shot deserved - and the home hero moves clear at the top! Updated leaderboard in a minute, because ... One of the shots of the day by Shane Lowry! He\u2019s sent his drive into the rough to the left of 10. A spot of trouble. But a little local knowledge goes a long way, and after discussion with his caddie, he powers an iron from 200 yards off the bank to the left of the green, the ball rolling dutifully right to ten feet! That is masterful links golf, and the crowd respond in the manner the shot deserves. Holmes, from the centre of the fairway, seems spooked and sends a hot second over the back of the green. He\u2019s on the fringe, but it\u2019s not clear he has a direct route to the flag because of the green\u2019s undulations. He might have to take a wedge, a la Gary Woodland on 17 at Pebble Beach last month. Two putts for Westwood, and it\u2019s his first dropped stroke since the 14th on Thursday. No more than he deserved after the dreadful drive, if we\u2019re being honest. He slips back to -9, two off the lead currently held by Lowry (in the rough back down the hole) and Fleetwood, who arrows in his straight birdie putt! -11: Fleetwood (10), Lowry (9) -10: Holmes (9) -9: Westwood (10) -8: Fowler (F) -7: Willett (F), Frittelli (13), Koepka (11) Westwood drops back in line, and sends his third into the heart of the green. He\u2019ll have an outside chance of saving his par from distance. You\u2019d hope the golfing gods allow him to make it, because he was very honest during a discussion with the rules official. His ball was embedded, which would have allowed him a free drop, but only if he would have played the ball from where it was. He honestly said no, he\u2019d have taken an unplayable, so that took precedence and it meant a one-stroke penalty. Fleetwood meanwhile screeches his second to 12 feet. Trouble for Lee Westwood at 10, as he sends a slice into a shrub down the left. He\u2019s forced to take an unplayable, his ball snagged under its branches. Up on 18, Rickie Fowler makes par, and he\u2019s home in 31. That\u2019s a 66, and he\u2019s the new clubhouse leader at -8. Holmes and Lowry take turns to pepper the flag at 9. But only one man converts his short birdie putt. No prizes for guessing, because you can almost certainly hear the roar from wherever you are around the world. -11: Lowry (9) -10: Westwood (9), Fleetwood (9), Holmes (9) Unhappiness Stan. Here\u2019s our man Ewan Murray on Kyle Stanley\u2019s slightly irritated take on yesterday\u2019s contretemps with Bob-Mac. Fleetwood\u2019s birdie putt is hellishly fast. And there\u2019s a big right-to-left break. He doesn\u2019t judge either factor with any great skill. He leaves himself a tricky four-foot tiddler coming back. Westwood, from almost exactly the same spot, learns absolutely nothing, his putt ending up right next to his partner\u2019s. Both manage to knock in their nervy par putts, though. And both men hit the turn in 33. Behind them, the other two leaders find the fairway with irons from the tee. -10: Westwood (9), Fleetwood (9), Lowry (8), Holmes (8) -8: Fowler (17) -7: Willett (F), Frittelli (11), Koepka (10), Harding (9) Garden-variety two-putt pars for the last pair, Shane Lowry and JB Holmes, on 8. Up on 17, Rickie Fowler closes the gap on the leaders by sending his second to eight feet and teasing in a left-to-right breaker. He\u2019s 8. And finally a couple of chances for birdie for Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood, who land their approaches 15 feet past the flag. A second birdie in three holes for Xander Schauffele. So much good work undone in short order. He\u2019s -5 and desperate for a strong finish to keep his hopes alive. Dylan Frittelli rattles in a long one on 11, and he moves to -7. And a birdie on 9 for Justin Harding. It\u2019s his second in a row, and he\u2019s -7. An impressive comeback in the wake of that double-bogey disaster on 5. JB Holmes spurns a fantastic opportunity to take the lead on his own. He whips a delicate bunker shot at the par-five 7th to four feet, but pulls at the short birdie putt. Par, a score matched by his playing partner Shane Lowry. Pars for Lee Westwood and Tommy Fleetwood up on 8, too. There\u2019s no splitting these lads up front. Bogey for Tony Finau at 11, meantime, and he slips to -6. -10: Westwood (8), Fleetwood (8), Lowry (7), Holmes (7) -7: Willett (F), Fowler (16), Koepka (9) An impressive 68 for Justin Thomas, though it promised more. He lost his forward momentum after making bogey at 14, and parred his way in from that point. He\u2019s -4. A level-par 71 for his playing partner Robert MacIntyre, who remains at -2. (For the record, Bob-Mac\u2019s philosophical sparring partner, Kyle \u2018Fore!\u2019 Stanley, bogeyed 13, 14 and 15 and ended the day down at +2 after a 73.) Meanwhile Brooks Koepka turns in a blemish-free 34. He\u2019s -7. Willett whip-cracks a stunning iron straight at the flag on 18. He\u2019ll have an uphill look at birdie ... and a course record - from ten feet. That was quite magnificent. But he can\u2019t make the putt, the ball bending off to the left at the last. That\u2019s a wee shame, but you can bet your bottom euro he\u2019d have taken a 65 at the start of Moving Day. He goes into Sunday at -7. Meanwhile Rickie Fowler wedges his second at 15 to six feet, and makes a birdie that takes him to -7. And Tommy Fleetwood, thanks to two big bashes that send his ball to the front edge of the par-five 7th, makes a simple birdie that gives him a share. -10: Westwood (7), Fleetwood (7), Lowry (6), Holmes (6) -7: Willett (F), Fowler (15), Finau (10), Koepka (8) Danny Willett crashes his drive at 18 down the centre of the fairway. If he makes a birdie here, he\u2019ll post a new course record of 64. (Rory McIlroy\u2019s celebrated 61 was on the old configuration of this course.) He\u2019s in the perfect spot to go for it. Par threes for Lowry and Holmes at 6. Trouble for Justin Rose at 8, though: off line with his tee shot, two poor chips, and the bogey takes him back to -6. While Holmes was scrabbling about, Lowry found the green at 5 in two, setting up a ten-foot birdie chance. In it goes, and he reclaims a share of the lead! A huge roar. Holmes follows him in for par, a fine scramble that\u2019s celebrated by some lovely partisan silence. But there\u2019s another loud whoop over on 17, where Danny Willett chips to four feet and makes his sixth birdie of the day! He rises to -7 and a tie for fifth! But it\u2019s a first bogey since Thursday for Xander Schauffele, at 14, and he slips to -6. -10: Westwood (6), Lowry (5), Holmes (5) -9: Fleetwood (6) -7: Willett (17), Finau (10), Koepka (7), Rose (7) Holmes takes his free drop at 5, to the left of the scoreboard. But though he\u2019s got an improved lie, he\u2019s still in the cabbage. And there\u2019s that OB just over the green. So it\u2019s no surprise that he doesn\u2019t commit to his chip, and his ball lands apologetically short of the green, still in the thick rough. He clips his second effort very nicely to eight feet, and he\u2019s got a great chance of scrambling par. Meanwhile an easy two-putt birdie for Brooks Koepka on 7; he\u2019s -7. Lee Westwood: magician. He bashes a delicate chip into the bank front-right of him, sending his ball arcing up onto the green, flying back a little leftwards towards the cup. It gently stops at par-saving distance. His partner Tommy Fleetwood nearly drains a 60-footer for an outrageous birdie. But par will do for him as well. Meanwhile Tony Finau is slowly mooching up the standings. He turns in 33, after birdies at 2, 5 and now 9, the latest reward for an approach sent to ten feet. He\u2019s -7. And it\u2019s back-to-back birdies for Tyrrell Hatton, at 10 and 11, and he\u2019s -6, far from out of this! Uh-oh, JB. He sends a huge slice into thick filth to the right of 5. As his ball curves hysterically through the air, he must be seriously worried about losing it. But what a huge break! It does indeed land in disgraceful rubbish ... but he\u2019s right behind a scoreboard, so he\u2019ll get relief from there. What could have been disaster appears to have been averted. But there\u2019ll be tricky times for Westwood up on the par-three 6th. He nearly hits the perfect tee shot, straight at the flag. Nearly. But it\u2019s swallowed up by a little run-off which takes his ball down a steep, furry swale. That\u2019d be a tricky chip if the flag was on the other side of the green, but he\u2019s shortsided. God speed, Lee Westwood. Fleetwood is the width of a cigarette paper away from eagle on 5. He sends his tee shot just short of the green, then crisply chips up the bank, his ball kissing the left lip but refusing to drop. He taps in for birdie and moves to -9, a shot off Westwood and Holmes\u2019 lead. Westy can only chip up to 20 feet, and he\u2019s left with a putt that breaks violently from left to right. Too much to ask. Just the par. And it\u2019s pars for Holmes and Lowry back on 4. Justin Harding\u2019s hot chip at 5 costs him a double. He clatters down the standings to -6. A wonderful fast start was all for nought. \u201cLee Westwood leading! He couldn\u2019t, could he? Let\u2019s make sure. Someone throw Stewart Cink into the boot of a car and start driving, now!\u201d Hubert O\u2019Hearn there, with advice that comes ten years too late for poor old Tom Watson. Robert Peston Dylan Frittelli is one of those players at -6. He\u2019s got there in a very roundabout way. Birdie at 2, double at 4, and now an eagle at 7, sending a two-bounce wedge into the cup from 100 yards! Justin Rose meanwhile nearly drains a monster on 6 for birdie but has to settle for a par; he remains at -7. Disaster for Justin Harding at 5, as his chip into the green takes a flyer. It bounds through the green, and settles in the dry moat running behind. That\u2019s OB. Bogey for Jordan Spieth at 6, and he slips back to -6. But it\u2019s three birdies in a row for Lee Westwood, who splits the fairway at 4, wedges to 15 feet, then rolls in the putt! A fairytale in the making here. Imagine if the eternal bridesmaid finally catches the bouquet! -10: Westwood (4), Holmes (3) -9: Lowry (3) -8: Harding (4), Fleetwood (4) -7: Schauffele (11), Rose (5) -6: There are a lot of people at -6 JB Holmes had gone close as well, though. Straight at the flag, leaving a straight six-footer. In goes the birdie effort. Lowry follows him in. This is really special. -10: Holmes (3) -9: Westwood (3), Lowry (3) Rickie Fowler\u2019s stealthy creep up the leaderboard continues apace! It\u2019s back-to-back birdies, the latest at 11, and he\u2019s -6. There\u2019s no bigger student of links golf, and there\u2019d be no more popular winner than the likeable Californian. Well, OK, maybe Shane Lowry has dibs on that. And speaking of the big man ... he lands his tee shot at the par-three 3rd just to the right of the cup. One bounce past, and he nearly spins it back for an ace! He\u2019ll surely make birdie from a couple of feet. Lee Westwood takes sole ownership of the lead after clacking his tee shot at the par-three 3rd to six feet! What a start for the major-championship nearly man! He\u2019s -9. Though he\u2019s soon joined there by JB Holmes, who sends a delightfully judged putt up the swale and across the warped 2nd green, his ball stopping 18 inches to the left of the hole. Shane Lowry has to make do with par, after chipping up from further out and taking a couple of putts. Meanwhile birdie for Justin Harding, who bundles his second into 4 off the camber to the right of the green, and strokes home a left-to-right putt from eight feet. -9: Westwood (3), Holmes (2) -8: Harding (4), Fleetwood (3), Lowry (2) -7: Schauffele (11), Spieth (5), Rose (4) Justin Rose with a sensational par save on 4! He\u2019s always out of position, down the left of the hole, but rakes in a 40-footer to remain at -7. That\u2019ll feel nice and tingly, and he celebrates accordingly. Plenty of support from the gallery too. His partner Brooks Koepka misses a 12-footer for birdie. He\u2019s not been confident with the flat stick all week. There was footage of him on the practice green the other day, yipping one from Rory-at-16 distance, suggesting something\u2019s nagging away at him. Could it be his Achilles heel this week? He\u2019s only two off the lead at -6, so probably not. There\u2019s not been much backwards movement among the leading players. But here\u2019s something: Cameron Smith misses a tiddler on 3 and slips back to -6. Meanwhile neither of the final pair can find the par-five 2nd in two. Both tug their approaches down the swale to the left. Lowry in particular is left with a puzzle, as his ball rolls into a divot amid the semi-rough. It\u2019s three birdies in four holes for Xander Schauffele. He\u2019s not dropped a shot since Thursday afternoon, and he\u2019s -7. Meanwhile news of Rickie Fowler, who has evaded the radar for most of the week despite plodding along nicely. An early bogey today at 4, but he\u2019s since responded with birdies at 5, 7 and 10, and at -5 is just three off the lead. Birdie at the par-three 3rd for Justin Harding, meanwhile, thanks to a lovely tee shot to ten feet. And nearly an eagle for Lee Westwood at 2! He tidies up for birdie, and joins the leaders! This is such a great leaderboard. -8: Westwood (2), Fleetwood (2), Lowry (1), Holmes (1) -7: Schauffele (10), Spieth (4), Rose (3), Harding (3), Smith (2) -6: Park (14), Willett (13), Stenson (9), Finau (6), Koepka (3) -5: Fowler (10), Noren (8), Kuchar (7) The wind that had been forecast simply hasn\u2019t arrived. Hence the birdie blitzes all across the course. Can either of the final pair make one at the opening hole? JB Holmes has apparently quickened up his game since copping for plenty of abuse regarding his glacial pace of play. Apparently. Having failed to get his approach close, he takes an absolute age to work out the long putt, and the speed of his ball matches the speed of his decision-making process. It\u2019s well short. But he rams in a six-footer to scramble his par. Just. His ball thought about staying up for a second there. Lowry, working at ten times the pace, knocks a medium-length birdie putt to kick-in distance. A pair of pars. Away from the hubbub at the 1st ... hubbub elsewhere! Birdies for Henrik Stenson at 8, Park Sang-hyun at 14, and Tony Finau at 4. All rise to -6. Another one for Justin Thomas, too, and he\u2019s up to -5. And Cameron Smith birdies 2 to join Spieth, Rose and Westwood at -7. An ovation that would rattle your fillings at the first tee, as Ireland\u2019s Shane Lowry takes to the stage. He sends a slightly nervous iron towards the thick stuff down the right, but the ball takes a kind bounce left and sits up in the semi. JB Holmes splits the fairway with his tee shot. More bedlam. And if the final pairing didn\u2019t already know that things have suddenly got very real, up on the green Tommy Fleetwood begins his charge with an opening birdie, ramming in a right-to-left 20-foot slider. Almost immediately, Southport\u2019s finest grabs himself a share of the lead! -8: Fleetwood (1), Holmes, Lowry -7: Spieth (3), Rose (2), Westwood (1) Another birdie for Danny Willett! His fifth of the day, at the par-five 12th. At -6, he\u2019s just a couple of shots off the lead. Meanwhile birdies for Jordan Spieth at 3, and Justin Rose at 2, whisk that pair up to -7, one shy of JB Holmes and Shane Lowry\u2019s 36-hole mark. And right on cue, here come the leaders. They\u2019ll tee off with the breath of the chasing pack on their necks. A chasing pack that now contains a certain Brooks Koepka, who nearly made eagle at 2. -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Spieth (3), Rose (2), Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Willett (12), Schauffele (8), Frittelli (3), Koepka (2), Harding (1), Smith (1) A very disappointing back nine carded by Shubhankar Sharma. The young Indian prospect turned in level-par 36, but made five bogeys in the next six holes, and ended up signing for a 77. He clatters down the standings to +6. Not a great day for last year\u2019s final-day hero Eddie Pepperell, either. A hungover 67 gave him the clubhouse lead for a while, and eventually a share of sixth, and there\u2019s a fair chance he\u2019ll be hitting the pop on Saturday evening again. A decent start today, with birdie at 2, but six subsequent bogeys led to a 76. He\u2019s +5. An\u2019s first slip of the day. A bogey at 9, the result of a yipped tiddler. But he\u2019s still turning round in 33. He\u2019s -5. Heading the other way: Xander Schauffele, who rolls in a 15-footer on 8 for back-to-back birdies. How he\u2019ll wish he configured his driver properly on Thursday morning, before running up that out-of-whack 75. He\u2019s -6. And the Californian is joined there by Jordan Spieth of nearby Texas, who picks up a stroke at the generous par-five 2nd. -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Schauffele (8), Frittelli (3), Spieth (2), Rose (1), Smith, Harding Dylan Frittelli is bidding to become the first man to win the Open wearing spectacles since Ian Baker-Finch in 1991. (David Duval\u2019s sunglasses in 2001 don\u2019t count.) The 29-year-old South African wears thick brims; imagine a less-flustered version of ITV political editor Robert Peston, and there you have it. Frittelli\u2019s in hot form after winning last week\u2019s John Deere to earn his place here, and he nearly drains a monster eagle putt at 2. He\u2019s so unfortunate as his ball breaks just to the left during the last turn of a 70-foot journey. But he joins the lads at -6. An keeps on keepin\u2019 on! He clips his second at the box-fresh 8th straight at the flag, six feet short. In goes the putt, and it\u2019s his fourth birdie of the day. He\u2019s only hit an average of one in three fairways so far! He\u2019s the first player today to join the group at -6. Birdie for Schauffele at 7; he joins the popular -5 gang. And a little more detail on Willett\u2019s birdie at 10: he benefited from a massive break, as he sent his approach towards the grassy banks on the left, only for his ball to twang back into the heart of the green and stop a few feet from the flag. Hey, take your luck when it comes. Look at this. There are 19 players within three shots of the lead! This Open is almost obnoxiously entertaining. And we\u2019re only just past the halfway mark! -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Smith, Harding, Rose -5: Park (11), Willett (10), An (7), Stenson (5), Simpson (5), Noren (5), Kuchar (4), Rahm (3), Frittelli (1), Koepka, Spieth, Putnam The 2017 PGA champ Justin Thomas is making a serious move today. Another birdie at 8, then he hits the turn in 33. He\u2019s -4. And Danny Willett is going along even better: having also turned in 33, he makes his fourth birdie of the day at 10. He\u2019s -5. It really is all going on. Alex Noren has started well. Birdies at 2 and 4, and the 37-year-old Swede, who finished in a tie for sixth at Birkdale a couple of years ago, joins the ever-growing group at -5. The latter birdie is seriously fortuitous, as he batters a long putt from the fringe with far too much conviction. Had the hole - and the flagstick - not got in the way, that ball was sailing off the other side of the green. Reward for laser-guided accuracy, I guess, but Noren has the good grace to blow out hard in the theatrical style. He\u2019s joined at -5 by Jon Rahm, who nearly makes an eagle putt from the side of 2, but settles for his par. Another birdie for Park Sang-hyun! His fourth of the day, thanks to a trundle across 10. He joins the group at -5. As does Matt Kuchar, who nearly chips in for eagle at 2, but birdie will suffice. You could throw a blanket over the top 16. This round is shaping up to be a riot. -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Smith, Harding, Rose -5: Park (10), An (6), Stenson (4), Simpson (4), Kuchar (2), Koepka, Spieth, Putnam, Frittelli Dustin Johnson should have back-to-back birdies on his card ... but he doesn\u2019t. After making one at the inviting par-five 2nd, he clips his tee shot at 3 pin high to six feet, as good an effort as we\u2019ve seen today. But he gives the putt a rare old skelp, and the ball trundles through the break. A costly rush of blood. Par, and he remains at -4. The 2016 champ Henrik Stenson makes back-to-back birdies! He races in a 40-footer across 3, and makes it up to -5. His partner Webb Simpson, the 2012 US Open champion, matches him shot for shot. And they\u2019re both joined at -5 by An Byeong-hun, who solves another putting puzzle at 5. This one is from 20 feet, but over a hump jutting in from the left, causing issues of both line and pace. He solves both as his ball kicks right and drops into the cup at perfect weight. Also: another birdie for Danny Willett, reward for his sending his second shot at 8 to 12 feet and guiding in the gentle right-to-left slider. With the wind down, it\u2019s all happening again! -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Smith, Harding, Rose -5: An (5), Stenson (3), Simpson (3), Koepka, Spieth, Putnam, Frittelli -4: Park (9), Willett (8), Schauffele (4), Noren (2), D Johnson (2), Kuchar (1), Van Rooyen, Finau, Bjerregaard, Reed, Rahm An Byeong-hun had no record to speak of in the majors ... until a tie for 16th at Pebble Beach last month. Full of fresh confidence, the 27-year-old South Korean - a former British PGA champion at Wentworth (2015) - is going along nicely today. He\u2019s followed up birdie at 2 with another at 4, the latter thanks to a 30-foot wonder putt from the fringe at the back of the green, the ball taking a 90-degree right-turn halfway along its route to the cup. He\u2019s -4. Meanwhile birdies for Henrik Stenson and Webb Simpson at 2, and they move to -4 too. We spoke earlier of 2011 amateur sensation Tom Lewis. Eagle at 2 was soon erased by bogeys at 3 and 6, but the 28-year-old from Welwyn Garden City regained his momentum in style, picking up birdies at 9, 12 and 14 on his way to a fine 68. He\u2019s -2 having made a decent advance up the standings today. A most pleasing start for the 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett. Birdies at 3 and 5 and he\u2019s currently tied for 20th at -3. Willett was in the final pairing on Sunday in 2015, though weather delays meant that was only the third round. Still, he ended the week tied for sixth, his best performance at the Open. He\u2019s coming off the back of a tie for 12th at last month\u2019s US Open, his highest finish in a major since winning at Augusta, so confidence should be replenished after a couple of barren, injury-hit years. Onwards and upwards! The wind has dropped, so there should be a concomitant improvement in scoring. Schauffele makes his first birdie of the day at the par-five 2nd, to move to -4. Thorbjorn Olesen rises to -3 after a birdie-bogey-birdie run between 2 and 4. But Thomas Pieters ships a shot at 4 to slip back to -3. Russell Knox birdies 9 to turn in 34. He\u2019s -3. Birdie for Justin Thomas at 5, his second of the day after 2, and he rises to -3 as well. There was an early birdie for etiquette specialist Robert MacIntyre at 2; the 22-year-old from Oban is -3 overall through 5. And Joost Luiten has just carded three birdies in a row, at 11, 12 and 13, to rise to -3. A fine response to back-to-back bogeys at 9 and 10. Early birdies for big-hitting Thomas Pieters, at 2 and 3. Belgium\u2019s finest joins late-blooming South Korean Park Sang-hyun, who has birdied 2, 4 and 5, in making inroads at the business end of the leaderboard. Look see! -8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Smith, Harding, Rose -5: Koepka, Spieth, Putnam, Frittelli -4: Park (7), Pieters (3), Van Rooyen, Finau, Bjerregaard, Reed, Rahm, Kuchar A brisk start by the 2002 and 2012 champion Ernie Els. Birdies at 2 and 3. Should the veteran triumph tomorrow, he\u2019d break the record held since the 1968 PGA by Julius Boros for oldest major winner. Somebody\u2019s going to do that some day, so why not the Big Easy? Nobody thought he had much of a chance at Lytham seven years ago, either, and look what happened there. Ah bugger, I\u2019ve spoken too soon, he\u2019s just bogeyed 4. Still, he\u2019s -3 and going along nicely. Sorry, Ernie. Thanks David! Back just in time to see Xander Schauffele tee it up. The 25-year-old from San Diego shot a bogey-free 65 yesterday, more than making up for Thursday\u2019s surprisingly below-standard 75. Turns out he had to turn in his driver earlier in the week, as it didn\u2019t meet with strict R&amp;A regulations. He wasn\u2019t too fond of the first replacement, and his driving accuracy for the first round was miserable, hitting only 43% of fairways, a poor show compared to the field average of 61%. But he tinkered on the range afterwards, and yesterday found a better fit, hitting 93% of the fairways, the best in show, especially when you compare it to the 57% average of the entire field. The ten-shot difference in his two rounds, right there. Anyway, he\u2019s found the fairway with his first drive today, leading to an opening par. More of yesterday\u2019s antics today, and one of the pre-tournament favourites will be right back in it come tomorrow. We have another early mover and it\u2019s Korean Park Sang Hyun. The world number 141 honed his links skills over the last fortnight by playing the Irish and Scottish Opens and, despite a pair of missed cuts, three of his four rounds were in the 60s. Three birdies in his first six holes today and he finds himself just four off the lead. The 36-year-old punched his ticket to Portrush after making birdie at six of his final nine holes at the Japan Tour\u2019s Mizuno Open last month. On that enjoyably obscure fact, I\u2019ll hand you back to Scott Murray! McDowell brushes in the birdie putt at 18 and, for now, that\u2019s the clubhouse lead of 2-under. A sprinkle of magic at the end to complete an impressive third lap of Royal Portrush. Add that to Shane Lowry\u2019s flying start and Rory\u2019s brave attempt to rise from the dead, and the Irish players have certainly given the home crowd reason to let rip with a few Cheltenhamesque roars. Lucas Glover, no relation to Brian, is soaring like a kestrel. He makes a third straight birdie, the latest at No.4, to continue his move up the leaderboard and, at -4, the American is just four off the pace. Talking of birdies, a mighty roar for Graeme McDowell as he plonks his approach from the middle of the 18th fairway to four feet. \u201cI don\u2019t think I got it all, go hard\u201d, shouts G-Mac. The ball listens and he\u2019ll have a short putt to sign for a 68 and post -2 in the clubhouse. That\u2019s currently tied 30th. Still a little frustrating for the neutral that no-one from the pack has infiltrated page one of the leaderboard. American pair Lucas Glover and Patrick Cantlay could be the first to make inroads as both are -3 for the tournament and -2 for the day after back-to-back birdies at 2 and 3. Glover, the 2009 US Open champion, is enjoying his best season for some time while Cantlay recently moved into the world\u2019s top ten after a thrilling win at the Memorial Tournament. He started the final round there four shots behind the leader but won by two thanks to an 8-under 64 so if you\u2019re scribbling notes next to the runners and riders in the current top 20, pencil in \u201clikes a final-day charge\u201d next to Cantlay. Four players shot 6-under 65s in Friday\u2019s second round although, as one of them was Rory McIlroy, only three will get the chance to pull off that most difficult of feats: going low one day and following it up with another good \u2018un the next. The three remaining members of the 65 gang are Americans Xander Schauffele and Kevin Streelman, and South African Justin Harding. Streelman is already reeling a little after playing his first eight holes in +2 while Harding and Schauffele, T5 and T18 respectively, are yet to tee off. We\u2019re often spun the line that starting the last 36 holes seven, eight or even nine shots back at an Open is no impossible hurdle, especially given the vagaries of the British weather. The concept of a weekend charge is compelling but, unfortunately, there\u2019s not a great deal of truth in it. Starting from Tom Lehman\u2019s victory at Lytham in 1996 and there are just two examples of winners starting the final two rounds outside the top 15. Francesco Molinari was tied 29th and six back before coming through to win at Carnoustie last year while David Duval sat tied 35th after two days of frustration at Lytham in 2001 before turning on the afterburners and hoisting the Claret Jug. Duval was seven behind at halfway, as was Ernie Els when Red Rum to Adam Scott\u2019s Crisp, again at Lytham in 2012. Outliers offer hope at least and, as I say that, Justin Thomas (currently seven back) pings a tee shot off the first tee. Could he be this year\u2019s weekend charger? Still a wee while before Shane Lowry walks on to the first tee (3:50pm) and ramps up the decibel levels. In the meantime, let\u2019s head to stats corner for some clues on how the Irishman might perform today. There are no guarantees \u2013 especially in these unique circumstances \u2013 but the good news is that Lowry has a strong record as a front-runner. He\u2019s held the 36-hole lead/joint-lead five times in his European/PGA Tour career and never gone on to finish worse than third from such a position. Twice he converted those leads in to silverware, the first in his famous win as a 500/1 amateur in the 2009 Irish Open and the second when going wire-to-wire in this year\u2019s Abu Dhabi Championship. On the other three occasions, he finished just a single shot behind the winner in both the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and Wales Open in 2014 while he ended two back at this year\u2019s RBC Heritage at Hilton Head in South Carolina after entering the weekend on pole. Yep, he\u2019s made of solid stuff the Irishman. After two days of excellence, there\u2019s good reason to expect continuation not capitulation. Thanks Scott. Walking Netflix box-set series, Doc Redman, and Kiwi Ryan Fox still have the best rounds going today. Both are 3-under for the day, Redman sitting at 3-under for the championship after seven holes of his third lap and Fox -2 overall after 10 holes. Redman is tied 18th and Fox tied 26th but there\u2019s still a sense that we\u2019re watching the support acts before the headliners come on. More essential reading in lieu of serious leaderboard movement. Here\u2019s our man Sean Ingle on how the Open is giving Northern Ireland a good punt up the pound. Clickity click, off you trot. I\u2019m practising what I preach, by the way, because I\u2019m off to read it as well. In the meantime, the loving arms of David Tindall await you. See you again soon! Other than Doc Redman, who is three under for his round through the first six holes, nobody\u2019s making huge inroads today. The wind\u2019s up, and Portrush is a much more testing proposition. But in any conditions, quality will out, and the defending champion Francesco Molinari creams his second at 14 to 12 inches, and makes birdie. That was a sensational approach at the hardest hole on the course. Much as you\u2019d expect for a man who won his Claret Jug at Carnoustie, the toughest test of all. Though he\u2019ll not be matching Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington as a 21st-century back-to-back winner: he\u2019s +2. Another birdie for Portrush hero Graeme McDowell. He follows up the one he made on 11 with another at the par-five 12th. He\u2019s -1, and must be turning over the tatty denouement to his opening round again and again in his mind. That 5-3-5-7 finish cost him five precious strokes, the difference between simply performing at the weekend, and being right in the mix. Still, look at Darren and Rory, it could be a lot worse. Willebrordus Adrianus Maria Luiten - also known as Joost, to the blessed relief of live bloggers around the world - started out as a ski jumper. But he had a bad fall as a ten-year-old, breaking both elbow and nose, and so transferred his talents to the meat golf. Winter sport\u2019s loss is golf\u2019s gain, and the 33-year-old Dutchman has started out today with birdies at 2 and 5. He\u2019s -2, currently tied for 27th and well placed to beat his Open Championship best finish of tied-44 at Birkdale two years ago. The Doc is made of the proper stuff. He sends his tee shot at the par-three 6th bounding down a deep swale at the back left of the green. He does pretty well to lob up to 15 feet, though the par putt\u2019s far from certain. But he knocks it in nervelessly. He\u2019s been taking breathing exercises to control the jitters. They seem to be working. He remains at -3, forward momentum brilliantly maintained. In lieu of Weekend Rory Action ... here\u2019s the story of yesterday\u2019s act of doomed heroism. Back-to-back birdies for Kevin Kisner. A textbook no-frills amble up the par-five 2nd and he\u2019s -3. Doc Redman opts not to attack the pin at the big-risk-and-reward 5th; he wisely wedges short of the flag, taking the OB behind out of play, and cradles up a putt. Par. He remains at -3 alongside Kisner. And Ryan Fox, who had bogeyed 6 since we last heard of him today, takes the shot back at 8 with a lovely 20-foot right-to-left curler. He\u2019s -1 again. A birdie for G-Mac on 11. He curls a lovely right-to-left 25-footer into the cup. He\u2019s level par now, in credit for his round today, having earlier birdied 2 and bogeyed 6. The home crowd, momentarily stunned by Rory\u2019s doomed comeback and Darren Clarke\u2019s last-gasp capitulation yesterday, find their voice again. Hear them roar. Another long putt sunk by the Doc! Redman rattles it in from 30 feet at 4, and that\u2019s three birdies in a row! He\u2019s -3. Last year\u2019s joint runner-up Kevin Kisner opens with birdie to move immediately to -2. And on 5, with the pin tucked towards the back of the green and the wind whipping towards the sea, Kyle Stanley hits an overly aggressive second that rolls through and out of bounds. No spectators standing there, so at least that\u2019s something. He tries again, wedging to 12 feet. Two putts later, that\u2019s a double bogey, and all his early gains have been lost. He\u2019s level par again. Now then, Doc Redman. Doc\u2019s not a nickname, it\u2019s on his birth certificate. (Dr Golf, a mere fictional confection of the HBH, is beyond jealous.) Redman\u2019s parents were certainly creative; his sister is called Karma. Anyway, the 21-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina looks the real deal. He\u2019s been playing since the age of three, golf one of his two passions along with calculus. He\u2019s been known to hit over a thousand putts a day to groove in his stroke; how many equations he solves per week isn\u2019t on record. Anyway, Redman shot 62 in a qualifier to reach the recent inaugural Rocket Mortgage Classic, then went on to grab second place and with it a spot in the Open. He\u2019s admitted to suffering from nerves in the past, most notably when he teed it up at the Masters last year, missing the cut, but he\u2019s looking in control this week. Back-to-back birdies this morning at 2 and 3, the latter the reward for a 40-foot tramliner, and he\u2019s -2. Now Stanley does extremely well to get up and down from the bottom of a bank at the par-three 3rd, after a weak tee shot. A decent chip up to 15 feet, then a brilliant putt to scramble. He remains at -2. Meanwhile birdies at 2 for a couple of English stars in Eddie Pepperell and Paul Casey, both men rising to -1. And it\u2019s a fast start by this week\u2019s record breaker, Ryan Fox. The Kiwi played the back nine in 29 strokes on Thursday, the best figures in Open history. Now he\u2019s opened today with birdies at 2 and 5. He\u2019s -1. Just to say, he could go on to birdie 6, 8 and 9, and eagle 5, and even then he\u2019d be a shot shy of Denis Durnian\u2019s front-nine Open record of 28, set at Birkdale in 1983. But one rewriting of the history books is enough, let\u2019s not get greedy. Philosophy corner. Yesterday\u2019s dialectical discourse between Robert MacIntyre and Kyle Stanley - in which the young Scot posited a thesis suggesting it\u2019s advisable to shout \u201cfore!\u201d when you spray a shot towards the gallery, the American reacting with an antithesis of \u201cbugger off\u201d, synthesis as yet unpublished - seems to have lit a fire under the latter. Stanley very nearly makes eagle at 2, but settles for a kick-in birdie that whisks him up to -2. He\u2019s now in a tie for 25th, just six shots off the lead jointly held by JB Holmes and Shane Lowry. It\u2019s a bunched leaderboard all right. But here\u2019s another: Benjamin Hebert birdies 2 to rise to -1 for the championship. The 32-year-old Frenchman - it\u2019s the 20th anniversary of Jean van de Velde\u2019s heroic failure, by the way - is in hot form. He qualified for the Open only last week, after shooing a final round of 62 at the Scottish Open to make a play-off with Bernd Wiesberger. He lost that face-off at the third extra hole, but it meant he was teeing it up at the Open for only the second time. He missed the cut at Birkdale in 2008, shooting 79-73 as an amateur. This time he\u2019s going along very nicely. Throw in the biggest paycheck of his career last week, and it\u2019s been a fine few days for M. Hebert. Birdie for Stanley on 1! Go Kyle! Go Kyle! A lovely 20-footer rolled across the green after a pin-high approach. He moves into red figures at -1. Stanley hasn\u2019t done much in the majors; the 31-year-old from Washington state\u2019s best finish is a tie for 21st at this year\u2019s Masters. He\u2019s probably more famous for his maiden PGA Tour victory at the Phoenix Open in 2012, making up eight shots in the final round to win, a week after shipping a six-shot final-round lead of his own at the Farmers Insurance Open. Only in sport, huh. Sadly the aforementioned Tom Lewis follows up his eagle at 2 with bogey at 3, and slips back to level par. So now Stanley is the only one of the morning starters in red figures for this year\u2019s tournament. A warm reception on the first tee for Kyle Stanley. Whether he deserves such blanket respect may be a moot point, given he fired two shots into the gallery yesterday, failing to shout fore on both occasions. His second wild one hit the mother of playing partner Robert MacIntyre\u2019s caddie, leading to a full and frank exchange of views in the scorer\u2019s hut later on. Maybe it was just a momentary lapse of judgement on Stanley\u2019s part; we all have off days. Hopefully he\u2019ll learn from it. However, it\u2019s a good sign for Scottish golf, so long in the doldrums, that the 22-year-old prospect from Oban has the nerve to stand his ground with an established pro during his rookie season on Tour. It\u2019s been a long time since Tom Lewis made a name for himself by leading the Open as a 20-year-old amateur. That was 2011, when he shot an opening 65 at Sandwich, the lowest round by an amateur in Open history. It made him the first amateur to lead the Open since the renowned Michael Bonallack managed it back in 1968. One of Lewis\u2019s playing partners that day was the five-time winner Tom Watson, after whom he was named. Lewis finished the week tied 30th as low amateur, the Silver Medal hanging around his neck. Such a shame one won\u2019t be awarded this week, with no amateur making the cut. Anyway, Lewis has since turned pro, with a couple of victories on the European Tour to his name, both at the Portugal Masters, in 2011 and 2018. He\u2019s belatedly delivering on his early promise, with a notable upturn in form during the last couple of years. And he\u2019s eagled 2 this morning, sending a magnificent second shot to four feet, to become the first of the early starters to make it into red figures. He\u2019s -1 for the tournament. While we wait for folk to get properly moving on Moving Day ... here\u2019s a typically illuminating piece from our man Andy Bull on golf in Northern Ireland during more uncertain times. Good morning Ulster. News to follow, but let\u2019s start with the weather. It\u2019s a lovely sunny day on the Antrim coast. The beautiful Dunluce links of Portrush shining in all its glory and splendour. It looks as though the sun will be out for most of the day. Some cloud in the afternoon perhaps. And there\u2019s not a huge likelihood of rain. If we get any, it\u2019ll be later in the afternoon and/or early evening, and not particularly heavy. But while Portrush\u2019s defences were totally down yesterday, the conditions still, the breeze is expected to pick up today. Gusts of up to 25mph at some points. As a result, the chances of a repeat of round two\u2019s across-the-board low scoring aren\u2019t super-high. Then again, these are the world\u2019s top golfers we\u2019re talking about. Also, Shane Lowry was out in the worst of yesterday\u2019s weather, and he still went out in 31. So let\u2019s assume nothing. Onward! If the first two days of the 148th Open Championship are anything to go by, the weekend is going to be a heady Portrush rush. Look at the drama we\u2019ve already been served up: a hole-in-one for Emiliano Grillo; a nonuple-bogey 14 for David Duval; a record-breaking back-nine 29 for Ryan Fox; an opening quadruple-bogey for pre-tournament favourite Rory McIlroy, who\u2019d go on to miss a putt from 12 inches on his way to a 79; a 78 for Tiger; a triple-bogey capitulation at the 18th that cost local hero Darren Clarke his weekend participation; an Irish charge by Shane Lowry; the late-career renaissance of Lee Westwood; and 65s for Xander Schauffele, Justin Harding and ... Rory McIlroy, who fell one stroke short of a comeback for the ages. And there are still two whole days to go! With so many big names on the shoulder of leaders Shane Lowry and JB Holmes, today won\u2019t just be about moving. The way things have been going, it\u2019ll also feature some grooving, shaking, rattling, rolling, bumping, grinding, twerking, the twist, the hitchhike, the watusi and the mashed potato. The only downside is the lack of a Silver Medal battle, no amateurs having survived the cut. Ah well, we can\u2019t have it all. It\u2019s still on. Moving Day is on.

      "body": "<p>Frankie Dettori outrode his fellow jockeys once again and stole a Classic from the front aboard Star Catcher in the Irish Oaks. The Italian, winning this race for the fifth time, was allowed an uncontested lead from an early stage, despite the presence in the field of a presumed pacemaker from the Ballydoyle stable.</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago a 33-1 shot made all the running to win the Irish Derby and, with the Curragh again riding fast, there was an obvious potential advantage for any runner that could get the lead without having to fight for it. Star Catcher had raced in midfield when winning the Ribblesdale at Royal Ascot on her previous start but it should have surprised no one that Dettori would be switched on to the different tactical demands this time.</p> \n<p>He had Star Catcher in front and on the rail within strides of the starting stalls. Peach Tree, widely expected to be setting the pace for her stablemates, Pink Dogwood and Fleeting, settled in a respectful second position, a length or so behind.</p> \n<p>The order of the field hardly changed until the turn for home, at which point Dettori began to ask his mount for everything. She had plenty in reserve and was soon clear. Meanwhile the other fancied runners were in the last three places at the home turn and had to work their way among or around the outsiders before trying to reel in Star Catcher.</p> \n<p>Fleeting closed to within half a length while Pink Dogwood again looked short of pace in finishing third, five lengths behind the winner. It is the eighth time in 11 years that the Irish Oaks has been won by a British trainer, in this case John Gosden.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe vibes at home were good,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cJohnny had a good feeling about her. Unfortunately we had to supplement her [at a cost of \u20ac40,000], so we put our necks on the block a bit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7c3fa7c9-4b4c-4c91-a33d-da1a6a738e79\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Newton Abbot</b> <b>2.05</b> Velvet Revolution <b>2.40</b> Ennistown <b>3.15</b> Indian Harbour <b>3.50</b> Chasma <b>4.25</b> Must See The Doc <b>5.00</b> Isle Road <b>5.35</b> Alanjou (nap)</p>\n    <p><b>Redcar</b> <b>2.20</b> Thunderous <b>2.55</b> Farhh Away <b>3.30</b> Greengage (nb) <b>4.05</b> Kolossus <b>4.40</b> Slaithwaite <b>5.15</b> Gymkhana <b>5.45</b> Warning Fire <b>6.15</b> Nearly There</p>\n    <p><b>Stratford</b> <b>2.25</b> Superefficient <b>3.00 </b>Win My Wings <b>3.35</b> Doubly Clever <b>4.10</b> McGroarty <b>4.45</b> Some Day Soon <b>5.20</b> Boy In A Bentley <b>5.55 </b>Dazibao</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe knew she would stay a mile and a half, that\u2019s for sure, so we didn\u2019t want to sit and sprint. Once Seamie Heffernan on the obvious frontrunner couldn\u2019t make the front, I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to make my own way home.\u2019 And then it\u2019s a matter of getting the fractions right and having a tailwind in the straight that helps a frontrunner, and that was the case.\u201d</p> \n<p>Star Catcher carries the black and white colours of Anthony Oppenheimer, who enjoyed a huge day as his lightly raced Dame Malliot won a Listed race at Newmarket by five lengths. She is trained by Ed Vaughan, who promised that she would now be given \u201csome really big entries\u201d.</p> \n<p>On a day when horseboxes were crossing borders all around northern Europe, Newbury\u2019s Hackwood Stakes fell to a German raider, with Waldpfad walloping the local runners and most of the punters by scoringat 33-1. The horse, whose name means \u201cforest path\u201d, is trained near Hanover by Dominic Moser, who now has quite a record for seizing English trophies.</p> \n<p>His Artistica was also allowed to start at 33-1 when she won a Listed prize at Nottingham in 2017, while Gracia Directa was a 14-1 shot when bagging a Group Three at York in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s like we can only win when we come here,\u201d said Moser, which is over-egging things a bit, as he has had 21 runners in Britain.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were hoping he would be in the first three but he\u2019s gone and won just like last time,\u201d Moser said, in reference to a Hamburg victory a fortnight ago. Waldpfad may return to Newbury for next month\u2019s Hungerford Stakes and is entered in the Haydock Sprint Cup in September.</p> \n<p>There was late support for The Tin Man but James Fanshawe\u2019s veteran sprinter laboured disappointingly on his way to finishing seventh in a race he had won three years ago. Perhaps the key to him can be rediscovered \u2013 after all he was a Group One winner last autumn \u2013 but it begins to look as if his best days are behind him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Frankie Dettori outrode his fellow jockeys once again and stole a Classic from the front aboard Star Catcher in the Irish Oaks. The Italian, winning this race for the fifth time, was allowed an uncontested lead from an early stage, despite the presence in the field of a presumed pacemaker from the Ballydoyle stable. Three weeks ago a 33-1 shot made all the running to win the Irish Derby and, with the Curragh again riding fast, there was an obvious potential advantage for any runner that could get the lead without having to fight for it. Star Catcher had raced in midfield when winning the Ribblesdale at Royal Ascot on her previous start but it should have surprised no one that Dettori would be switched on to the different tactical demands this time. He had Star Catcher in front and on the rail within strides of the starting stalls. Peach Tree, widely expected to be setting the pace for her stablemates, Pink Dogwood and Fleeting, settled in a respectful second position, a length or so behind. The order of the field hardly changed until the turn for home, at which point Dettori began to ask his mount for everything. She had plenty in reserve and was soon clear. Meanwhile the other fancied runners were in the last three places at the home turn and had to work their way among or around the outsiders before trying to reel in Star Catcher. Fleeting closed to within half a length while Pink Dogwood again looked short of pace in finishing third, five lengths behind the winner. It is the eighth time in 11 years that the Irish Oaks has been won by a British trainer, in this case John Gosden. \u201cThe vibes at home were good,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cJohnny had a good feeling about her. Unfortunately we had to supplement her [at a cost of \u20ac40,000], so we put our necks on the block a bit. \u201cWe knew she would stay a mile and a half, that\u2019s for sure, so we didn\u2019t want to sit and sprint. Once Seamie Heffernan on the obvious frontrunner couldn\u2019t make the front, I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to make my own way home.\u2019 And then it\u2019s a matter of getting the fractions right and having a tailwind in the straight that helps a frontrunner, and that was the case.\u201d Star Catcher carries the black and white colours of Anthony Oppenheimer, who enjoyed a huge day as his lightly raced Dame Malliot won a Listed race at Newmarket by five lengths. She is trained by Ed Vaughan, who promised that she would now be given \u201csome really big entries\u201d. On a day when horseboxes were crossing borders all around northern Europe, Newbury\u2019s Hackwood Stakes fell to a German raider, with Waldpfad walloping the local runners and most of the punters by scoringat 33-1. The horse, whose name means \u201cforest path\u201d, is trained near Hanover by Dominic Moser, who now has quite a record for seizing English trophies. His Artistica was also allowed to start at 33-1 when she won a Listed prize at Nottingham in 2017, while Gracia Directa was a 14-1 shot when bagging a Group Three at York in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s like we can only win when we come here,\u201d said Moser, which is over-egging things a bit, as he has had 21 runners in Britain. \u201cWe were hoping he would be in the first three but he\u2019s gone and won just like last time,\u201d Moser said, in reference to a Hamburg victory a fortnight ago. Waldpfad may return to Newbury for next month\u2019s Hungerford Stakes and is entered in the Haydock Sprint Cup in September. There was late support for The Tin Man but James Fanshawe\u2019s veteran sprinter laboured disappointingly on his way to finishing seventh in a race he had won three years ago. Perhaps the key to him can be rediscovered \u2013 after all he was a Group One winner last autumn \u2013 but it begins to look as if his best days are behind him.",

Such legal threats are designed to inhibit ongoing investigations, and prevent legitimate public interest reporting. Abuse of defamation law, including through SLAPP lawsuits, has become a serious threat to press freedom and advocacy rights in a number of countries, including the UK. Fears have been expressed in the UK and abroad, and by the European parliament that this legal tactic was being deployed against the murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who at the time of her death in October 2017 was subject to 42 civil libel suits against her, many of which were brought through UK-based law firms, acting for foreign banks and wealthy individuals. Twenty-seven of these vexatious lawsuits remain open more than 21 months after her assassination. A range of other Maltese media have faced threats of similar suits, including investigative outlet the Shift News. Numerous legal and online threats have been made against Carole Cadwalladr, whose journalism for the Observer and a range of other publications has stimulated a global debate about the power of online platforms to influence the behaviour of citizens, and raised important questions about the regulation of digital technology. The legal claim against Ms Cadwalladr, issued on 12 July by lawyers acting for Arron Banks, is another example of a wealthy individual appearing to abuse the law in an attempt to silence a journalist and distract from these issues being discussed by politicians, the media and the public at a critical time in the life of our democracy. The increasing deployment of what appear to be SLAPP lawsuits in the UK poses a threat to media freedom and public interest advocacy, and demands a robust response. We believe that new legislation should be considered to prevent the abuse of defamation law to silence public interest investigative reporting. We also urge you to take a clear public stance condemning such practices and supporting investigative journalism and independent media. We urge you to address this issue as a matter of priority. Action has been discussed within the institutions of the European Union, but it is important that the government makes clear that the UK remains a country that welcomes and celebrates the role and value of independent public interest reporting.

At least India, England and Australia have bridged the gap in terms of skills with the men - I just can\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t be able to play four-day matches more often. Two to three years of non-broadcasted but regular matches between the other top nations would improve their skills too, and soon we will surely see high-quality cricket amongst enough teams.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for today. The match report will be up here soon. Thanks for all the messages, it was an intriguing day. Have a lovely evening everyone. Good night! Well that was a curate\u2019s egg of an innings by England. A super partnership between Jones and Knight, but after Jones fell the momentum slowed. Sciver played very well for her unbeaten 62 - but it had become a rearguard action with Brunt and Shrubsole defending doughtily. Debut Test fifties for Jones and Sciver. I guess England decided that the humiliation of losing the Test as well as the ODIs, and the state of the pitch, meant it wasn\u2019t worth sending everyone in to have an old heave-ho. What a day for Sophie Molineux, three wickets on debut! 83rd over: England 199-6 (Sciver 62, Shrubsole 1) Last over of the day and the ball is thrown to Gardner. Sciver dashes a single. The last ball is to Shrubsole, Gardner pauses, fielders move from x to y, a seagull flies across the ground, Australia call for a helmet and shin pads and the crowd start slow hand clapping. Now then.... Shrubsole places glove on hip and ... the ball is legside ...and she pads it away. At stumps, England trail by 221 with just a day to go. To win back the Ashes, England needed to win the game. 82nd over: England 198-6 (Sciver 61, Shrubsole 1) Sciver whips Molineux to mid-wicket and they run two. Then a half-hearted chop. This has end-of-day written all over it. 81st over: England 195-6 (Sciver 58, Shrubsole 1) Australia choose not to take the new ball. Gardener continues as the shadows start to creep across the pitch. Just a single as the overs tick away. 80th over: England 194-6 (Sciver 56, Shrubsole 1). Shrubsole soaks up five balls of the over. Just a single to Sciver. Avitaj Mitra has the germ of an idea. \u201cHello Tanya! Clearly, this test is plodding away to an inevitable draw (as things stand currently). \u201cSuggestion:England bat for 20 overs tomorrow.. score 271 (thus avoiding the follow on) and declare. The Aussies bat another 15-20 overs, score say 90 runs and declare. \u201cEngland would need 240 odd in 50 overs on a pitch taking prodigious spin. Of course, *very* unlikely to occur, nevertheless.. considering the paucity of Women\u2019s test matches.. this would set up a potentially thrilling finish. Opinions welcome.\u201d I love it! But it won\u2019t happen. 79th over: England 193-6 (Sciver 56, Shrubsole 1). Oooooh a leg bye! 78th over: England 192-6 (Sciver 56, Shrubsole 1). It is maiden city at Taunton. Another from Molineux. Ah, there\u2019s Enid Bakewell giving a cheery wave. . One of Wisden\u2019s Five Greats and incredibly young at heart with a candy-crush obsession. Heres\u2019s a super piece by Joe Wilson. 77th over: England 192-6 (Sciver 56, Shrubsole 1) Gardner has a spring in her step, understandably, spinning on her right foot, arm diagonally across Shrubsole\u2019s toes. Sciver and Shrubsole have a mid-wicket chat. Are there instructions?Will they tarry a little less? And while we\u2019re at it women\u2019s cricket experts - I\u2019m ashamed to ask this but why only four days? 76th over: England 190-6 (Sciver 54, Shrubsole 0) Shrubsole is watchful, pretty keen to get down the other end as Molineux flights the ball with some style. 75th over: England 189-6 (Sciver 54, Shrubsole 0) A wicket maiden for Ash Gardner! A great little innings there by Brunt - 75 balls and blood sweat and tears in that there 15. Brunt edges onto the stumps via her pads . The end of a super vigil - but I fear doom\u2019s door is now open. Gardener\u2019s first wicket in Test cricket! 74th over: England 189-5 (Sciver 54, Brunt 15) Molineux spins one past Shiver\u2019s bat. Tasty. Then paddle-sweeps for two. The new ball will be available in six overs. 73rd over: England 186-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Schutt bowls another maiden. The acceleration waits for another over. Abhijato has an answer to Geoff\u2019s question: \u201cI\u2019m inclined to go with Alyssa Healy, the next best all-rounder in the side. She pulls off excellent feats of athleticism behind the stumps to back up a consistent pair of gloves, while also being a highly successful aggressive opener in the mould of Gilchrist. Her outstanding run of form won Australia the last T20 World Cup and she could very well do it again. If I can\u2019t have Ellyse Perry in my team, I\u2019ll shout and stamp the ground like Tanya; if I can\u2019t have Alyssa Healy in my team, I\u2019ll cause a riot.\u201d 72nd over: England 186-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Another maiden by Molineux. 71st over: England 186-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Sciver is tempted to have a go at a wide one from Schutt. Don\u2019t do it Nat! Oush, the next one nearly goes through her, a desperate last minute jam down with the bat. So we\u2019ve got 12 overs to go, and England still trail by 234. They must risk defeat to have a go at victory, no? They must hit, hit and hit again. Abhijato has done algebra This crude formula is something I just whipped up for chases in T20s: [Number of Wickets left - {(Required Run Rate) - (Current Run Rate)}]*100. If result is above 55, batting side usually wins; if not, bowling side does ... Now, can anyone confirm or reject this? Scratching my head. Anyone? 70th over: England 185-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Lanning turns to Schutt with her idiosyncratic two-step-bend at the top of her mark. A word here for Brunt who is having to play an atypical knock, curbing her natural instincts. Actually I read a super piece (that will appear in the next Nightwatchman magazine) about the mental strain needed to do that. Geoff Wignall is setting OBO readers quizzes: \u201cI was wondering: if you could steal one of the Aussies to play for England but you couldn\u2019t have Perry, whom would you choose (and why)?\u201d I can\u2019t have Perry? Why not? Shout and stamps. 68th over: England 185-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Nicole Bolton hurts her right hand diving to stop a drive at extra cover. The physios runs on with their bag of tricks and they bandage up her wrist and thumb with flesh coloured tape. Sciver watches Molineux\u2019s next three deliveries with great care and shows a beautifully straight back John Box too wants a scorecard. Fingers crossed! If it doesn\u2019t get sorted tonight - not sure if I\u2019ve emailed the right person - we\u2019ll get it done for tomorrow morning. Thanks for the reminder. And someone\u2019s enjoying himself! 67th over: England 182-5 (Sciver 51, Brunt 11) . I\u2019m enjoying Vlaeminck\u2019s effort and enthusiasm. All long limbs and youth. Brunt pulls down to long leg off the last ball, they go through for a single and that\u2019s the fifty partnership. Ah, the camera pans back. How gorgeous Taunton looks, those spires and hills. The warmth of the evening sun. No jumpers on the fielders yet. 66th over: England 180-5 (Sciver 51, Brunt 10) I don\u2019t want to jinx anyone here but Sciver and Brunt are looking - dare I say it - untroubled out there. They nurdle a couple from Molineux, order a pinna colada and enjoy the evening sun. 65th over: England 178-5 (Sciver 50, Brunt 9) Sciver cuts Vlaeminck confidently and that\u2019s her maiden Test fifty in her fifth Test. She\u2019s played very well. She smiles broadly but there is still a lot to do. England trail by 243. 64th over: England 171-5 (Sciver 49, Brunt 7) Jonassen again. Sciver pulls a shortish ball, it floats towards the boundary and she moves on to 49. This is the saddest thing about the lack of long-form women\u2019s cricket. 63rd over: England 171-5 (Sciver 45, Brunt 7) Vlaeminck runs in accompanied by a chorus of seagulls. Hold on to your ice-creams. Just one off the over, a single down to fine leg. Geoff Wignall writes: Good afternoon Tanya, Hi Geoff! These Australians seem an impressive and unrelenting bunch.Re the treatment of women\u2019s cricket: I\u2019m sure if this was a men\u2019s test I wouldn\u2019t have to scroll down to 5 hours ago to discover the Aussie 1st innings total - might even get a scorecard link. A matter for your corporate overlords? Er....I\u2019ve gone blank as to what we normally do. Let me try for a link. 62nd over: England 170-5 (Sciver 44, Brunt 7) Jonassen raises her hands and her voice for hearty lbw shout - but it was bat before boot. Not out. Just discovered that Nat Sciver nudged Vlaeminck for the 100,000th run in women\u2019s Test cricket in the last over. Rosette someone! 61st over: England 169-5 (Sciver 43, Brunt 7) Tayla Vlaeminck runs in - 70mph isn\u2019t bad for a loosener. She was a bit all over the place in her first spell, perhaps a little longer out at pasture will have settled the nerves. She mixes it up - a bouncer, full length and a widish delivery on the offside. Just one from the over. Another cracking piece on Perry. Loving the fact the best writers WANT to write about women\u2019s cricket. What a sea change. 60th over: England 168-5 (Sciver 42, Brunt 7) A Nat Sciver dive saves her skin as she and Brunt scamper two from Jonassen. A little later on in the over Sciver is tempted forwards to prod and the ball, I think, falls just short of Meg Lanning at slip. Australia\u2019s spinners revelling in Ciderabad. And that\u2019s drinks! Crucial session coming up now, this summer\u2019s evening in Somerset. 59th over: England 164-5 (Sciver 39, Brunt 7) Sciver gets busy, cracking Gardner for a boundary through mid-wicket and scampering a few more. 58th over: England 153-5 (Sciver 32, Brunt 7) Ok Adam and I are having computer malfunctions. Hopefully this is me now.... 57th over: England 153-5 (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Gardner through another maiden, played watchfully by Brunt. She is 6 from 34 balls - not an equation you would normally associate with the power hitter. 57th over: Australia 153-5 (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Gardner again, reeling in. Brunt is looking a bit static and nervous but she\u2019s crowded by fielders. She mistimes a few. A maiden. 56th over: England 153-5 (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Sciver does have a pop at Molineux this time around but doesn\u2019t make contact from the standing sweep position. There\u2019s a polite enquiry, turned down. She does make good contact down the ground for a couple. I wonder if they will try Vlaeminck again for another burst at Brunt? 56th over: Australia 153-5 (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Sorry all computer malfunction. 55th over: England 151-5 (Sciver 26, Brunt 6) Gardner in again from the River End, Sciver off strike first ball with a single to square leg, Brunt doing her best to keep the rest out. This is a good spell. 53rd over: England 148-5 (Sciver 25, Brunt 6) Thank you Adam. I\u2019m all for getting funky but I think England are in a bit of a funk here. An attack/defend kerfuffle - what price a win? An inside edge by Brunt off Molineux skiddaddles away for a couple. 54th over: England 150-5 (Sciver 25, Brunt 6) With two to Brunt to finish the otherwise probing Molineux set, also through her legs (!), England have raised their 150. 53rd over: England 147-5 (Sciver 24, Brunt 4) Shot, Nat. Sciver gets down the track to turn a Gardner off break into a full toss, giving it the treatment. That\u2019s the aggression we enjoy from this fine all-rounder. She gets in behind the rest, smothering the spin from around the wicket. And with that, friends, I\u2019m out of here. Thanks for your company this afternoon. Back to Tanya to take us through to the close. Let\u2019s hope England do reach 271 and get FUNKY! 52nd over: England 142-5 (Sciver 19, Brunt 4) Brunt gets off strike from the first of Molineux\u2019s new over out to cover, Sciver doing likewise. Brunt has ample air to work with but doesn\u2019t swing. Yet. 51st over: England 140-5 (Sciver 18, Brunt 3) Gardner fires down a 75-second maiden at Sciver to keep the pressure on. The final offering is a clever one, going on with the arm and past the outside edge. 50th over: England 140-5 (Sciver 18, Brunt 3) Molineux really has been brilliant today, giving nothing at any stage. Ha, Sciver NATMEGS her behind square leg for one. I\u2019m here for all the 2017 World Cup nostalgia you\u2019ve got. 49th over: England 138-5 (Sciver 17, Brunt 2) I like this change, Gardner on to replace Perry to try in an effort to go through the gate with her off breaks. Just the one from from her first over back, Brunt keeping the strike. Do they encourage the Barnsley Express to have a big crack? Or Sciver, even? Both can make bulk runs in a hurry. 48th over: England 137-5 (Sciver 17, Brunt 1) Sciver whips away the final ball of the successful Molineux over through midwicket. England\u2019s longish tail will be exposed at some stage; the all-rounder needs to do the bulk of the heavy lifting. Hard to tell from one replay if that was pad/bat or bat/pad but without DRS it\u2019s academic - Taylor is out. Molineux gets her third with an excellent straighter one. 47th over: England 132-4 (Sciver 13, Taylor 5) A deep point for Perry now, reinforcing that she has been more than a fraction short in this second spell. She\u2019s straighter and fuller to both players, each clipping singles to midwicket. I wonder whether we might see the Bendigo Bullet for a little burst here before Taylor is set? 46th over: England 129-4 (Sciver 12, Taylor 4) They take their time again to set the field for Taylor. Once set, Molineux gives Taylor flight and when she overpitches, those rubbery wrists of the England \u2018keeper get a chance to snap the ball through midwicket to score a classy boundary to get off the mark. 45th over: England 124-4 (Sciver 11, Taylor 0) Perry to Sciver - another important period of the Test Match beginning here. Taylor\u2019s highest score in Tests is 40, which is hard to believe given what a player she has been. Sciver leaps on a short and wide offering, timing it through the gap just behind point to move into double figures, then off strike with one to long leg. With three balls left and Taylor on strike, Lanning takes a good 60 seconds to se the field in front of the England \u2018keeper, with a couple of slips in place for her first delivery. Nothing comes of it. For the umpteenth time, Jones is out between 50 and 100. It\u2019s not a flattering dismissal, dancing to the pitch but giving catching practice to Haynes at mid-off. 44th over: England 119-4 (Sciver 6) 43rd over: England 119-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 6) Perry continues and its an improved over compared to the two she sent down before the tea interval, Sciver careful in defence throughout. Maiden. 42nd over: England 119-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 6) RUN OUT CHANCE! Sciver took on mid-off and had to dive at the non-strikers\u2019 end, Haynes ever so close to a second direct hit dismissal. The shot was in the air to begin with, too. A nervous start, Molineux right on the money. Another cricketer who looks built for Test cricket. The players are back on the field. Jones (64) and Sciver (5) make their way back to the middle. Molineux has the ball in her hand from the pavilion end. PLAY! An excellent session for England. Yes, they lost a couple of wickets. But far more importantly, they got the board moving in the right direction, adding 115. With 42 overs remaining today, the deficit is 302. More importantly, the follow-on mark 153 from being overtaken. Once they get there, Heather Knight and the England brains trust have options. By contrast, if Australia\u2019s spinners can keep it ragging - especially Sophie Molineux, the best so far today - they could roll through them. 41st over: England 118-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 5) Perry in to Sciver, which is what she wants, but the radar is slightly off so the all-rounder can ease one to backward square. Now at Jones, she elects to redirect to around the wicket but the opener is savvy enough to avoid temptation outside the off-stump, thrice shouldering arms. Back over the wicket for the final delivery of the session, she leaves again. TEA! 40th over: England 117-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 4) Jonassen with what should be the penultimate over of the session. She is giving Jones a chance to swing with plenty of flight but the opener is content picking out cover rather than taking the field on. Jonassen gets through it quickly enough to ensure Perry can have another pop. 39th over: England 117-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 4) Perry is back, Lanning no doubt mindful of her record against Sciver. She starts on leg stump, turned by Jones to deep backward square for one, placing the all-rounder on strike with seven minutes left until tea. Perry is on her hip though, the all-rounder fetching two more to backward square. Oooh, one keeps low. Sciver is up to the task. Contest! This is a bit different in that, England just need time and control. Getting back out into the field as early as possible earns them both. They need a Sciver special. 38th over: England 113-3 (Jones 63, Sciver 2) Nice shot Nat Sciver to begin, on the back foot punching through cover for a couple, stopped by Schutt with a fine chase and dive on the rope. In terms of England\u2019s required rate to keep the game moving towards 271, it isn\u2019t the wost thing that Sciver is out there now with Taylor next. Brilliant by Bolton! Elwiss to the danger end was running hard but Bolton at short cover was on it in a flash and hit middle stump. Out by four inches. Ten dot balls followed by a risky quick single - how often do we see it? 37th over: England 111-2 (Jones 63, Elwiss 9) Gardner in right in her groove from around the wicket, Elwiss very happy to lean forward to smother the spin. 36th over: England 111-2 (Jones 63, Elwiss 9) Boom! Jones gets one in her arc from Jonassen to finish and makes no mistake, lofting over mid-on for her 12th boundary. I don\u2019t want to mozz her, but... Test ton on debut has a nice ring to it. 35th over: England 105-2 (Jones 58, Elwiss 8) Gardner through another broadly accurate over, only slipping with one delivery, Jones pulling that to a sweeper. 34th over: England 103-2 (Jones 57, Elwiss 7) Jonassen and co are up for leg before, Alex Wharf turning it down. The first replay suggests that it was perhaps hitting just outside the off-stump, but not far away at all. Tea is 20 minutes away, this session (and the next) extended by 15 minutes. Mel Jones is asked on TV whether Australia will be happy with a draw. \u201cYou are kidding, right?\u201d her response. Agreed. Any suggestion that Australia were attempting to kill the game with their first innings batting sells England\u2019s bowling, on this tough track, well short. It was bat then pad earlier in the over, further replays from earlier in the over confirm. 33rd over: England 102-2 (Jones 57, Elwiss 6) Oooh dear me! Gardner has drifted across Jones from around the wicket, cutting back through the gate to miss off-stump by the narrowest margin. We saw how effective Gardner was in this country during the 2017 World Cup, always a big turner of the ball. She gets away with one here, Jones unable to put away a ball down the legside. \u201cStay patient,\u201d says Healy, who is giving us a nice special comments stream through the stump mic. 32nd over: England 100-2 (Jones 57, Elwiss 5) Jonassen has been spun around to replace Molineux. \u201cLet\u2019s go, workhorse!\u201d says the ever-vocal Healy with the left-arm ortho now bowling from the pavilion or graveyard end. Jones adds another behind point, Elwiss driving two to cover to bring up the England 100. Nice going. 31st over: England 97-2 (Jones 56, Elwiss 3) Meg Lanning must be reading the OBO - here comes Ash Gardner for her first trundle in Test cricket, in from the River End on this sunny Taunton afternoon. She is operating around the wicket from the get-go, generating a nice bit of dip at Elwiss who can\u2019t get her around the corner, taking the fourth delivery behind point for one instead. Jones retains the strike with a clipped single off the front foot, her timing getting better and better. 30th over: England 91-2 (Jones 55, Elwiss 2) Molineux gives a bit of air to Jones who advances to launch her straight back over her head for four, moving to 50 with the shot at the first time of asking in Test cricket. She has reached the milestone in 96 balls, striking ten fours along the way. Has to double up now and get England to that magic 271 figure. Oh, make that 11 fours, the final ball of the over a ropey full toss, picked up over midwicket for the easiest of boundaries. 29th over: England 87-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 2) Excellent maiden from Jonassen to Elwiss, who is being asked a question with every delivery aimed at the stumps. After copping plenty of tap early on, the Queenslander now has 7-3-20-0. 28th over: England 87-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 2) Elwiss plays another little sweep to get off strike early in the Molineux over, Jones digging in for the rest. Might be time to get Ash Gardner on, an off-spinner who gives it such a mighty rip. 27th over: England 86-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 1) Elwiss off the mark first ball of the new Jonassen over lapping one behind square. Jones is forward to the rest, leaving no gap between bat and pad. She\u2019s looking very good. This has to be the day when she goes to three figures for England having so often fallen between 50 and 100. \u201cI know it\u2019s the centre-piece,\u201d writes John Nield, \u201cwhich by definition goes in the middle. But it does nothing for tests if one team starts the only test just needing a draw.\u201d I agree. The points system also doesn\u2019t help with all these even numbers. I would recast with T20s worth two, ODIs three and the Test five for the win, to the draw. There are plenty of other improvements along the lines you are talking about, too. 26th over: England 85-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 0) Molineux is now over the wicket, looking for the footmarks that have been on offer for tweakers throughout this match. She finds them a couple of times, beating Jones\u2019 bat, but overpitches to finish with the opener clipping expertly past square leg for her ninth boundary. 25th over: England 81-2 (Jones 43, Elwiss 0) This is the Jonassen we have learned to expect, operating around the wicket with plenty of flight at Jones. Jones keeps the strike with one out to cover. She\u2019s the England player most likely so far today. \u201cIt\u2019s late here in Queensland,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cI suspect that Australia just have to turn up for the rest of the series to retain the Ashes but I\u2019m not a realist, I\u2019m an English cricket fan and a Norwich City supporter. Nobody expected Norwich to beat Bayern Munich back in 1993, nobody expected the Ashes win in 2005 and nobody sees England getting anything from this series. Yet I still have hope, I still believe! I probably should go to bed.\u201d Well, if they want to win the have to declare 149 behind. A famous number in English Ashes history as well, innit? On the other hand, getting to 271 would be a pretty decent effort with the turn this pitch is now taking. 24th over: England 80-2 (Jones 42, Elwiss 0) Ooh! Elwiss is nearly run out first ball by Mooney under the lid in close, the new batter dragging her back foot. The throw misses. A wicket maiden for Molineux, who has been outstanding. A first Test wicket for Sophie Molineux! Knight is sweeping and missing, the ball going on with the arm, hitting her bang in front. No doubt about that. 23rd over: England 80-1 (Jones 42, Knight 28) Jonassen has bounced back well after copping some serious tap to begin, sending down two maidens either side of drinks. Jones plays her watchfully. 22nd over: England 80-1 (Jones 42, Knight 28) \u201cHow has that missed?!\u201d roars Healy from behind the stumps when Molineux beats Knight with another superb delivery, evading the edge and off-stump by the proverbial coat of varnish. Drinks! A fine shift for England. With 61 overs remaining today, they should be able to get up to that 271 mark that I was talking about a couple of overs ago. 21st over: England 79-1 (Jones 41, Knight 28) Much better from Jonassen, belatedly finding her range. Knight plays back a maiden with a minimum of fuss. 20th over: England 79-1 (Jones 41, Knight 28) Molineux now gives Jones something to hit, a full toss clobbered back over her head! She\u2019s riden her luck to a certain extent but we know the sort of form she\u2019s been in until the ODIs. Meanwhile, what do you think of my declaration suggestion for England? 19th over: England 74-1 (Jones 37, Knight 27) Shot! Jones again through the field off the back foot, waiting on Jonassen\u2019s short delivery and putting it away. The Queenslander, who was excellent in the ODIs, has already coughed up four boundaries. A wonderful hour for England, adding 71 without losing a wicket. 18th over: England 69-1 (Jones 33, Knight 26) Perfect response from Molineux, mixing up her pace but not her length, again beating Jones with a ball that grips and turns away from the right-handed opener. 17th over: England 68-1 (Jones 33, Knight 25) Jonassen replaces Vlaeminck from the river end, her first ball a no-ball half-tracker, smashed away by Jones through midwicket. Then overpitching, Jones leans into a classical cover drive into the gap along the ground for four more! Short again, Jonassen is carted through midwicket for a third boundary! \u201cF*ck sake!\u201d says the bowler through the stump mic. She gets out of the expensive over - worth 13 - with two well directed stock balls. \u201cShe\u2019s been a bit Jeff Thomson \u201872-73,\u201d says Daniel Viles of Vlaeminck\u2019s first spell in Test cricket. \u201cBut you have to watch her now so that you can enjoy her development into Jeff Thomson \u201874-75.\u201d I like that comparison a lot. 16th over: England 55-1 (Jones 21, Knight 25) Good little contest emerging between Molineux and Jones, two players on debut. The former is a fraction too full, the opener timing her along the turf straight back down the ground for four. She\u2019s back on the money by the end of the over, Jones looking to find the gaps. 15th over: England 50-1 (Jones 16, Knight 25) Something happening every ball from Vlaeminck\u2019s end, thudding into Jones\u2019 thigh pad with a delivery the jags back with bounce at serious pace. Earlier in the over, Knight helped a ball down leg on its way for four, Jones doing the same from a bouncer, albeit to fine leg for one. 14th over: England 44-1 (Jones 15, Knight 20) Molineux is showing her worth very quickly here, unlucky not to get a first Test wicket when Jones miscues a tossed up delivery just beyond the hand of Bolton at short cover! That\u2019s wonderful finger spin, coming the delivery after one that was darted in straight. Super start. 13th over: England 40-1 (Jones 11, Knight 20) This is exciting to watch, Vlaeminck really bending her nimble back. It\u2019s all over the place, down leg then right in the block hole. The shape her body makes when landing is something to behold, arms and legs in every direction. Earns a maiden for her efforts. This is going to be fun. 12th over: England 40-1 (Jones 11, Knight 20) Biiiig turn from Molineux. Ciderabad after all? \u201cThat\u2019s you, Soph\u201d says Healy when the spinner lands her stock delivery to finish, through two very good overs to begin her Test career with the ball. 11th over: England 39-1 (Jones 11, Knight 19) Here she is, the Bendigo Bullet, Tayla Vlaeminck. The pace is good - already the quickest bowler in the Test Match - but the accuracy not quite. There is a bit going on here, overstepping first up then spraying five wides waaay down the legside at Knight. The right arm quick finds her mark later in the set but is too short to Jones, who slaps a lovely punch off the back foot through cover for another boundary. As Mel Jones notes on TV, the two bowlers in operation now - both on debut - were housemates in Melbourne. 10th over: England 28-1 (Jones 7, Knight 19) There is a change from the pavilion end but it is Sophie Molineux replacing Schutt with her left-arm orthodox. Her first ball in Test cricket is taken on by Jones - uppish with a catching cover in play - not far at all from joining a famous club. Jones takes a couple more from the only short delivery in the over but all told, an accurate start. 9th over: England 24-1 (Jones 3, Knight 19) Shoooooot! Perry gives Knight a full delivery on middle stump and the England skipper strokes a glorious on drive for four. They trail by 400 exactly but Knight isn\u2019t mucking around. Nor can she. Oooh, an equally super stroke later in the over, played off the back foot with a straight blade at the top of the bounce past point for four more. Go on, Heather. OB Jato/Abhijato Sensarma has started a petition for more women\u2019s red-ball cricket, which he would like me to share. If that\u2019s your thing, here \u2018tis. 8th over: England 14-1 (Jones 3, Knight 9) Might be time for us to get a look at Vlaeminck for the first time shortly. Nothing wrong with the Schutt over, a couple from it, but they won\u2019t want Knight to get into her groove or Jones to feel at ease. 7th over: England 12-1 (Jones 2, Knight 8) Much better from England, who have settled after the pre-lunch interrogation. Knight, who has a fine record at Test level, clips a couple from Perry early in the over then finishes with an even better whip in the same diection, down to the rope for England\u2019s first boundary. 6th over: England 6-1 (Jones 2, Knight 2) Schutt bouncing away from us again, with her Rubel Hossain crouching start. Missing her mark to begin a wide is added, Jones then driving a full ball through the gap at cover for two - off the mark after 18 balls. Nice weight transfer there. Jones battled badly in the ODIs against Perry but she\u2019s a much better player than those numbers suggest. 5th over: England 3-1 (Jones 0, Knight 2) Oooooh, an unplayable to begin Perry\u2019s afternoon shift, her outswinger somehow missing both Knight\u2019s outside edge and the top of off stump. It was the middle session at Canterbury in both of England\u2019s innings four years ago where the Australian quick ran wild, taking the bulk of her nine wickets in that match. She backs up the swinger with a yorker, which Knight again does well to keep out before leaving and defending the rest. Super bowling. There was some criticism of Australia before play this morning but it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense given the visitors were pretty clear about wanting to bat once - entirely sensible after losing two sessions. With Perry and co, they have plenty of time. 4th over: England 3-1 (Jones 0, Knight 2) Lovely start, the South Australian beating the edge of the England captain with the opening ball of the session. Schutt generates so much inswing, it makes it tough to leave anything she sends down. Knight gets bat on ball thereafter, tucking a single to fine leg when a straighter one arrives. Jones leaves alone the ball she has to deal with. Excellent first over back. The players are back on the field. England are resuming at 2/1, some 418 runs behind Australia. Megan Schutt has the ball in her hand, continuing her spell from the pavilion end. The captain Heather Knight (1) is on strike. PLAY! Thank you, Tanya. Ellyse Perry is utterly unstoppable. Soon as I posted this picture of her beating Beaumont all ends up, she knocked her over with an outswinger to die for. Granted, the England opener played down the wrong line but she can be forgiven on the basis of the movement generated. Just brilliant. Here\u2019s the thing, though: how many more Tests will Perry play? I asked her about this at Canterbury after her 7/22 and then yesterday following her 116. Maybe one more, probably two, at most three? What a waste. She\u2019s built for this. Of course, she\u2019s too classy to complain but it doesn\u2019t make it any less disappointing. Take a look at Megan Schutt\u2019s proposal for more domestic red-ball cricket for women in Australia, which might help. I hope administrators are listening to the players, who are speaking as one through this protracted debate. Make it happen. It was the sort of morning that England might have dreaded while breakfasting in the early hours. Watching Australia bat on and on, to 400 and beyond, then having a nasty, brutish and short period to see off the marauding Australian bowlers. To lose Tammy Beaumont is a horrible blow. What an astonishing player Perry is though. An absolute champion with bat and ball. That\u2019s all from me for now - Adam Collins takes over post lunch and I\u2019ll be back later. 3rd over: England 2-1 ( Jones 0, Knight 1) Beaumont was squared up by that brutish ball from Perry - not exactly the start that England were hoping for. Knight smiles at Amy Jones as she walks in. What does that smile say? Help!!! No, no, let\u2019s be positive. It says: We can do it! Knight gets off the strike straight away with a brisk push to backward square leg and Jones sees out the rest of the over. And that, my friends, is lunch. A full ball, a straight ball and Beaumont props down the wrong line. She has to trudge off for a duck. 2nd over: England 1-0 ( Jones 0, Beaumont 0) Schutt, whose run-up is considerably shorter than Perry\u2019s and with her characteristic knee-bend at the top of her mark, shapes the ball . Jones flashes at a wide one off the last ball of the over - eeek. 1st over: England 1-0 ( Amy Jones 0, Tammy Beaumont 0 ) It\u2019s Perry - who else? The first ball swings a little and fades to be taken just above the ankles by Healy. England scuttle through for a leg bye then Beaumont gets a scorcher that just passes the edge of her thrust forward bat. Ok England, girder loins. The Aussies have their baggy greens on, and out come the umpires. STAT PACK: That was Australia\u2019s fourth highest Test score against England. And only the second time five batters in the top six have made fifty or more in women\u2019s cricket. That\u2019s it, Meg Lanning sticks her arm through the gap in the dressing-room glass and beckons her batters in. England will have ten minutes or so to bat before lunch. A sensational running catch by Amy Jones off a miscue from Mooney. 154th over: Australia 418-7 (Mooney 50, Gardner 4) Mooney drives Ecclestone and scampers a quick single, landing on her tummy as she charges towards the stumps - that\u2019s her debut Test fifty, off 87 balls. Well played! 153rd over: Australia 415-7 (Mooney 49, Gardner 2) Sciver drifts legside, too wide for Gardner, but too wide for Taylor too and ball drifts away for four byes. Sciver scuffs the grass in frustration. Then an lbw roar, but down legside. Lanning is running out of time here to send England\u2019s openers in for quick stint before lunch. So .... sandwiches before the storm? 152nd over: Australia 409-7 (Mooney 48, Gardner 1) Reward there for Ecclestone, who has fallen the unlucky side of a few umpiring decisions. Will Gardner throw the bat? A classy little Test debut innings from Molineux comes to an end when Ecclestone makes her way through her defences, a bit of skid, a bit of turn, and off fly the bails. 151st over: Australia 407-6 (Mooney 47, Molineux 21) Heather Knight throws her plans in the air, and the piece of paper with SCIVER on lands face up. A quick two brings up the fifty partnership off 78 balls. OB Jato knows one thing: \u201cAll I know is that in both Netball (second semi-final) and Cricket, England will be facing New Zealand in a World Cup knockout. Preservation of nails much?\u201d All too much! And I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know enough about netball to know if the New Zealand team play with the same admirable spirit and humility as Kane Williamson\u2019s group of men. 150th over: Australia 403-6 (Mooney 46, Molineux 18) Marsh appeals loudly for an lbw against Mooney. Mooney squares up and the ball hits her high on the legs. Probably too high. The replay says umpires call. Duly unperturbed, she then thrashes two fours in a row, the second a lofted whallop over midwicket. That\u2019s the four hundred. And on we got. 149th over: Australia 393-6 (Mooney 37, Molineux 17) Molineux looks utterly relaxed at the crease. Nurdling three runs, even when her timing is a bit off. Amazing news! Throw, chuck, vomit money at it ECB - please. With two World Cup winning sides as your poster boys and girls - what better chance will you have? An interesting email on Thursday from a father concerned that the ECB hadn\u2019t made the most of England Women\u2019s win. Let\u2019s hope they won\u2019t waste this opportunity. 148th over: Australia 388-6 (Mooney 35, Molineux 14) Heather Knight swaps Sophie Ecclestone for Anya Shrubsole. It\u2019s a maiden. And the drinks are being brought out... and still no declaration. Is it 400 they\u2019re looking for - or will they wait till lunch? 147th over: Australia 388-6 (Mooney 35, Molineux 14) Marsh again. Molineux tries to sweep her but Sarah Taylor collects neatly behind the stumps. Going back to Sarah Bacon\u2019s message - wondering how much the netball has cut through the public consciousness. As much as the CWC (pre-final)? Abhijato Sensarma thinks aloud: \u2018I\u2019ll make the statement everyone runs around: on an aggregate, women aren\u2019t as fast as men at the professional level i.e. at the peak of their abilities. Hence, there is a general perception that LOIs are still alright in quality while Test matches featuring them aren\u2019t, ahem, \u2018broadcastable\u2019. But cricket at its heart is more about skills than speed, especially on a level playing field. At least India, England and Australia have bridged the gap in terms of skills with the men - I just can\u2019t see why they shouldn\u2019t be able to play four-day matches more often. Two to three years of non-broadcasted but regular matches between the other top nations would improve their skills too, and soon we will surely see high-quality cricket amongst enough teams. The televised matches will attract viewers with the general advancement of the game, the market will open up, and Tests will become commonplace for women cricketers again. If only the ICC/national boards somehow become philanthropic in the short term, it would all go so well for everyone in the long term! 146th over: Australia 386-6 (Mooney 34, Molineux 13) England\u2019s throwing is having a funny five minutes, infected with randomness and a slight mad urgency. Oh that is lovely from Molineux, a late, late, cut that whizzes square for four past point. Shrubsole is not so impressed. 145th over: Australia 379-6 (Mooney 32, Molineux 8) Will Laura Marsh get a break before Australia declare? Oh dear, that\u2019s five overthrows as no-one backs up a Shrubsole shy at the stumps. Marsh waves both arms in the air in frustration, as does Shrubsole. Palfreyman tries to put a good spin on England\u2019s position. 144th over: Australia 372-6 (Mooney 25, Molineux 8) Molineux\u2019s debut innings hovers in the balance with a mis-timed pull, but it falls clear of a scampering Marsh. Two from Shrubsole\u2019s over. 143rd over: Australia 370-6 (Mooney 25, Molineux 6) Marsh, bowling her 31st over of the match, is as on the money as she was yesterday. Mooney has her instructions, we assume they aren\u2019t ATTACK! ATTACK! More ACCUMULATE! ACCUMULATE! An email from Sarah Bacon \u201cThanks, Tanya, for doing OBO today!\u201d A pleasure! \u201cWith apologies, I\u2019m watching the Aussie Diamonds taking on South Africa in the semi-finals of the netball this morning (while keeping a close eye on the cricket on my PC!). Intriguing (laudable?) to see so many English Rose fans in the stands today, lustily supporting ... Australia? Wow. Methinks they\u2019re hoping for England to beat NZ\u2019s Silver Ferns this afternoon, in order to meet Australia in the finals tomorrow. Good luck with that.\u201d Hmmm - a case of be careful what you wish for ?!?! 142nd over: Australia 370-6 (Mooney 25, Molineux 6) Anya Shrubsole gets her first over of the day. Mooney steps forward and smears the ball through mid-on for four. There\u2019s a bit of a wind fluttering the players\u2019 trousers, but good cricket-watching weather. 141st over: Australia 365-6 (Mooney 20, Molineux 6) A superb ball from Laura Marsh spins just past Molineux\u2019s bat and then somehow just over the top of off stump. Then a misfield as the ball passes Georgia Elwiss at point. If you want to watch Raf rant, try this 140th over: Australia 362-6 (Mooney 19, Molineux 4) Australia seem jumpy considering the position they\u2019re in. Mooney calls through a quick single that would have been out had Marsh\u2019s throw connected. Lots of hand clapping and exhortation from England\u2019s fielders. And Molineux is off the mark with a four with soft hands past backward point. Lovely shot. 139th over: Australia 357-6 (Mooney 18, Molineux 0) Just a leg bye off another tight over from Marsh. Molineux opens her eyes wide between the bars of her helmet. 138th over: Australia 356-6 (Mooney 17, Molineux 0) Brunt deserved that wicket after throwing her all into her bowling The wicket brings in Sophie Molineux - who was given her baggy green by the great Belinda Clark two days ago and is the Southern Vipers new KSL signing Jonassen flashes at a wide one and is well caught by Nat Sciver at gully. 137th over: Australia 355-5 (Mooney 17, Jonassen 8) Just two off Marsh\u2019s over. 136th over: Australia 353-5 (Mooney 16, Jonassen 7) Brunt over pitches and Mooney drives just to the left of Jonassen\u2019s toes. Four. Yummy! Romeo writes: \u201cI\u2019m not sure Katherine Brunt really wants to be described as a stallion. Maybe she does, but it does look a bit odd. And \u2018mare\u2019 would also look a bit strange and she\u2019s hardly a \u2018filly\u2019.\u201d I hesitated myself. But female terms for animals often have unpleasant connotations. I think we should battle to reclaim them but, but, but... as you say.... In these gender-flexible times, I\u2019m hoping you can imagine a glossy haired female stallion. Or maybe I should just stay away from animals... 135th over: Australia 348-5 (Mooney 12, Jonassen 6) Marsh again keeps it tight, just one off it, and the cameras pan onto Lanning and she looks straight ahead, and the camera pans away. Hmm. Will they just pass 350 or bat on till lunch and then try to bowl England out twice? 134th over: Australia 347-5 (Mooney 12, Jonassen 5) Katherine Brunt takes the ball. The commentators mention that her speeds have been up this Test match, consistently in the mid-70s. She just looks incredibly fit, a prime stallion, sleek and shiny, but there we go, she strays a little wide and Mooney drives her through the covers and across the boundary for four. 133rd over: Australia 343-5 (Mooney 8, Jonassen 5) Laura Marsh flies it high and just two come from the over. You\u2019d expect the Aussies to get a bit more of a shift on today. Do drop me a line if you can - love to know what is happening round the world this Saturday morning. Anyway, here we go: the players are out and Australia bat on... Nat Sciver thinks England\u2019s bowlers have got better and better since the first day. They\u2019ll be hoping that Australia\u2019s bowlers take a while to get going too. Looking forward to seeing this young talent running in - she\u2019s come back from a series of horrendous injuries to play her Test debut, she\u2019s fast, she swings it and she\u2019s full of vigour. I just want to flag up this extraordinary, er, number welcoming Somerset men\u2019s newest recruit: There are 108 overs scheduled and the forecast is for a lovely day, all day. Charlotte Edwards hopes Australia declare now and England score quickly and then somehow bowl Australia out again. Ebony Rainford-Brent thinks Australia will want to rub England\u2019s nose in the dirt. WOW - the sky is blue! An interesting thread here too on the legacy from the World Cup. Now let\u2019s see what the weather is doing at Taunton... A nice read from Adam Collins, who will be taking over later, on Perry. This was Perry yesterday on the beauty of Test cricket: \u201cI just really enjoy the challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a novelty too that we don\u2019t play a lot of them so you really want to make the most of it, having that time to just get into your innings and absorb pressure at times then capitalise on periods that flow your way.\u201d Her century makes her the second woman after the wonderful Betty Wilson to hit two Test hundreds in a row. Good morning everyone! The rain is torrenting heavily outside my front door but fingers crossed for better weather in Taunton - where rain has already poked her unwelcome fingers, curtailing things early yesterday. The attrition continued for much of Friday, with the peerless Ellyse Perry reaching her century and Rachel Haynes falling just short. England looked deflated as they walked off for lunch at 341 for five. They have two days (if the weather is kind) to somehow conjure a win from here. I\u2019m afraid it isn\u2019t going to happen - The Ashes will remain with Australia, who are simply a better resourced and prepared side, with a stronger structure behind them. Perhaps just a better side too - and there is no shame in that. Raf Nicholson explains in more detail in her match report from yesterday.",

The risk is that the event itself lacks consequence but, as personal and season\u2019s best times were consistently adjusted over the course of the day, it did not feel that way inside the London Stadium.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/19/dina-asher-smith-worlds-best-london-anniversary-games\">Dina Asher-Smith energised by the hype as world\u2019s best meet in London | Paul MacInnes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The headline act from a British point of view was Muir, who announced herself on the international stage at this event three years ago when she broke Dame Kelly Holmes\u2019s British record in the women\u2019s 1500m. Now 26 and a European champion, Muir had been expecting to race against the Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon but the Kenyan withdrew late on with an adductor strain.</p> <p>In her absence Muir took it on herself to dominate the race, sitting just behind the pacemaker from the off and holding her position without ever seeming to exert herself. Her finish was more impressive than her start, however, as Muir covered the final 300 metres in 43.14 seconds and blew away the field to win by several lengths in 3min 58.25secs.</p> <p>\u201cIt may have looked easy, but it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Muir said afterwards. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise I ran a 57-second last lap and I\u2019m so, so happy about that. The girls are really strong and I know that my advantage is in that kick, so I just sat in there and tried to take it easy. It was all about winning today and I did that.</p> <p>\u201cLondon is a really fast track and it\u2019s always a great atmosphere. The conditions are usually pretty good \u2013 it was a little bit windy today but the whole vibe of the place is really special and it makes athletes raise their game.

Excitement surrounding the 24-year-old only increased on the day after he breezed through his heat in a season\u2019s best 9.96. It was a race that also featured his fellow Briton James Ellington, who was making his first competitive appearance since a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/18/british-sprinter-career-threatening-injuries-head-on-crash-james-ellington-nigel-levine\" title=\"\">serious motorbike crash in 2017</a>.</p> <p>The final promised more as Hughes went up against a field that not only included the Canadian Olympic bronze medallist Andre De Grasse but the Jamaican legend Yohan Blake and current African champion, Akani Simbine. Hughes could finish only second, however, as the South African went on to win in 9.93. Hughes bettered his time from the heats as he edged past Blake in a photo finish but it was a more awkward run and contributed to a slight sense of anticlimax.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long season ahead and I\u2019m taking my time to get sharp,\u201d said Hughes, who had raced four times in 2019 before this weekend. \u201cI\u2019m happy to get a season\u2019s best and I\u2019m happy with the music that was playing before the race started, it got me fired up. Looking forward, I trust in my coach and I trust in myself as well. As I go forward I get more confident.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes is a native of Anguilla, one of the British Overseas Territories, and chose to represent Britain. Dobbin, meanwhile, was born in Doncaster but competes for Scotland and broke a Scottish record in finishing third in the women\u2019s 200m.</p> <p>With Dina Asher-Smith sitting this race out in favour of the 100m on Sunday, this was an event dominated by the Jamaican Elaine Thompson.

      "bodyText": "Laura Muir, Zharnel Hughes and Beth Dobbin seized the occasion of competing in London\u2019s former Olympic stadium to delight the crowds and deliver impressive personal performances on the opening day of the Anniversary Games. An unusual event, in that it both looks backwards and throws forward in time, the Muller Anniversary Games is part of the legacy of London 2012 and also an important staging post on the way to the World Championships in Doha in September. The risk is that the event itself lacks consequence but, as personal and season\u2019s best times were consistently adjusted over the course of the day, it did not feel that way inside the London Stadium. The headline act from a British point of view was Muir, who announced herself on the international stage at this event three years ago when she broke Dame Kelly Holmes\u2019s British record in the women\u2019s 1500m. Now 26 and a European champion, Muir had been expecting to race against the Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon but the Kenyan withdrew late on with an adductor strain. In her absence Muir took it on herself to dominate the race, sitting just behind the pacemaker from the off and holding her position without ever seeming to exert herself. Her finish was more impressive than her start, however, as Muir covered the final 300 metres in 43.14 seconds and blew away the field to win by several lengths in 3min 58.25secs. \u201cIt may have looked easy, but it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Muir said afterwards. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise I ran a 57-second last lap and I\u2019m so, so happy about that. The girls are really strong and I know that my advantage is in that kick, so I just sat in there and tried to take it easy. It was all about winning today and I did that. \u201cLondon is a really fast track and it\u2019s always a great atmosphere. The conditions are usually pretty good \u2013 it was a little bit windy today but the whole vibe of the place is really special and it makes athletes raise their game. My goal now is to win a medal in Doha.\u201d Expectation also surrounded the 100m sprinter Hughes who, like Muir, won gold in Berlin and last summer also posted a personal best of 9.91sec. Excitement surrounding the 24-year-old only increased on the day after he breezed through his heat in a season\u2019s best 9.96. It was a race that also featured his fellow Briton James Ellington, who was making his first competitive appearance since a serious motorbike crash in 2017. The final promised more as Hughes went up against a field that not only included the Canadian Olympic bronze medallist Andre De Grasse but the Jamaican legend Yohan Blake and current African champion, Akani Simbine. Hughes could finish only second, however, as the South African went on to win in 9.93. Hughes bettered his time from the heats as he edged past Blake in a photo finish but it was a more awkward run and contributed to a slight sense of anticlimax. \u201cThere\u2019s a long season ahead and I\u2019m taking my time to get sharp,\u201d said Hughes, who had raced four times in 2019 before this weekend. \u201cI\u2019m happy to get a season\u2019s best and I\u2019m happy with the music that was playing before the race started, it got me fired up. Looking forward, I trust in my coach and I trust in myself as well. As I go forward I get more confident.\u201d Hughes is a native of Anguilla, one of the British Overseas Territories, and chose to represent Britain. Dobbin, meanwhile, was born in Doncaster but competes for Scotland and broke a Scottish record in finishing third in the women\u2019s 200m. With Dina Asher-Smith sitting this race out in favour of the 100m on Sunday, this was an event dominated by the Jamaican Elaine Thompson. The double Olympic champion won easily in 22.13. But Dobbin\u2019s 22.5sec finish shaved 0.09sec off her personal best and deservedly won the acclaim of the crowd. \u201cI usually start the season slowly and I didn\u2019t expect it would come good today\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great feeling.\u201d Elsewhere there were some marquee performances and not every one came from a Jamaican. That said, Danielle Williams probably delivered the most impressive of them as the sprint hurdler ran 12.32, the second fastest time in history and a Jamaican record, in the 100m hurdles final.

Black Americans led the struggle and paid the price in lives and mental health. And yet, for all that struggle and bloodshed, black Americans could not have enacted crucial legislation alone.

      "bodyText": "The businessman Arron Banks and the unofficial Brexit campaign Leave.EU have issued a legal threat against streaming giant Netflix in relation to The Great Hack, a new documentary about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the abuse of personal data. The threat comes as press freedom campaigners and charity groups warn the government in an open letter that UK courts are being used to \u201cintimidate and silence\u201d journalists working in the public interest. In a joint letter to key cabinet members, they call for new legislation to stop \u201cvexatious lawsuits\u201d, highlighting one filed last week by Banks against campaigning journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Award-winning reports by Cadwalladr, a freelance journalist who works for the Observer, have led to multiple investigations by regulators, and a $5bn fine for Facebook. \u201cThe legal claim against Ms Cadwalladr, issued on 12 July by lawyers acting for Arron Banks, is another example of a wealthy individual appearing to abuse the law in an attempt to silence a journalist and distract from these issues being discussed by politicians, the media and the public at a critical time in the life of our democracy,\u201d the letter says. Banks had not seen The Great Hack, which comes out on general release on Netflix this week, when he instructed lawyers over the documentary. London law firm Kingsley Napley, acting on behalf of Banks, his company Eldon Insurance, and Leave.EU, said in a letter on 16 July that their clients were concerned it would include \u201cfalse and defamatory allegations\u201d about their clients made by Cadwalladr and others. The Observer understands they demanded a right to see any allegations made in the film, and be given a chance to respond, by Wednesday 17 July. The lawyers warned Netflix they would rely on any failure to respond, or failure to meet their demands, in any future legal proceedings they considered necessary or appropriate. The Great Hack\u2019s co-director Karim Amer said: \u201cWe have received a letter from Arron Banks\u2019s solicitors, which we have responded to, making clear that we stand by the contents of the film and will vigorously defend against any claim. We find it ridiculous that Arron Banks and his solicitors would issue such a letter without having seen the actual film. \u201cWe would invite Mr Banks to watch the film when it premieres worldwide on Netflix on 24 July.\u201d He added that Banks would be welcome at a London screening at the ICA that day. The Observer\u2019s editor, Paul Webster, criticised the legal action against Cadwalladr. \u201cThroughout her investigations she has been the target of a relentless campaign of smears and vilification by some of the subjects of her inquiries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest legal threats are a further attempt to smother vital investigative reporting.\u201d Banks said: \u201cI\u2019m a great supporter of a free media and press. Unfortunately, Brexit has caused a breakdown in usual journalistic standards. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t tolerate is outright lying or misrepresentation of the facts \u2026 Carole Cadwalladr will have to stand up her wild claims in court and face the consequences or apologise,\u201d he said. He did not comment on the letter sent to Netflix. Press freedom campaigners who signed the joint letter to the UK government say they have noted a growing trend of wealthy individuals using lawsuits to silence or intimidate journalists. The 16 signatories included Webster, and the directors of leading media and artistic freedom groups the Committee to Protect Journalists, PEN, Index on Censorship, Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res ,campaign group Greenpeace, a law scholar and the family of murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. In addition to Banks\u2019s case against Cadwalladr, the letter also highlights legal threats to Galizia, who at the time of her death faced more than 40 civil lawsuits, many brought by UK-based firms. Often the spectre of costly legal action can force a retraction or prevent a story being published; in other cases rich individuals may hope to silence critics with limited resources through the cost and time of a court case. \u201cOne of the things we have become increasingly worried about was the use of legal threats to silence journalists, and especially the threat of expensive libel suits,\u201d said Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of Index on Censorship. In the US there have long been concerns about lawsuits of this kind, which are known as \u201cstrategic litigation against public participation\u201d, or \u201cSlapp\u201d cases. Several states have laws that stop these cases being brought to court. Sometimes just the threat of legal action can kill a story. \u201cSlapp lawsuits can be a very low-cost means of [subjects of negative reporting] getting what they want, because quite often they don\u2019t even need to take anyone to court,\u201d said Rebecca Vincent, UK director of Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The organisation last year gave Cadwalladr its L\u2019esprit de RSF award, and Vincent praised her for discussing the lawsuit publicly. \u201cI think she is very courageous about speaking out about this abusive defamation lawsuit that has been filed against her, because so often these cases remain hidden,\u201d she said. Cadwalladr has questioned why Banks chose to lodge a personal case against her rather than suing the outlets that published her work, or the Ted platform that hosted a speech at the heart of his case, which have resources to fight a long legal battle. \u201cArron Banks is not suing Ted or the Guardian and Observer, though it is the extensive investigations that we have published and that have helped trigger several serious criminal investigations that has prompted this lawsuit,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, he has chosen to go after me as an individual in a clear attempt to intimidate and harass me. It\u2019s extremely concerning that a millionaire can use the law in this way. This isn\u2019t just an attack on me, it\u2019s an attack on journalism.\u201d This year Britain has positioned itself as a world leader on media freedom, hosting a global conference, appointing barrister Amal Clooney as a special envoy on the issue, and promising to consider the impact on press freedom of any new legislation. Ginsberg urged authorites to make good on those promises by cracking down on abuses within the country. \u201cGiven that the UK has made media freedom its major focus for 2019, one way it could take a lead is dealing with the big UK law firms who are helping the rich and powerful to stifle investigative journalism.\u201d",

It\u2019s more like toxic word association: \u201cFacebook\u201d, \u201cdata\u201d, \u201charvested\u201d, \u201cweaponised\u201d, \u201cTrump\u201d and, in this country, most controversially, \u201cBrexit\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was a media firestorm that\u2019s yet to be extinguished, a year on from whistleblower Christopher Wylie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\" title=\"\">revelations in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em> and the <em>New York Times</em> about how the company acquired the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users in order to target them in political campaigns.</p> \n<p>This week sees the release of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAMoPbj3jQE\" title=\"\">The Great Hack</a></em>, a Netflix documentary that is the first feature-length attempt to gather all the strands of the affair into some sort of narrative \u2013 though it is one contested even by those appearing in the film.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not about one company,\u201d Julian Wheatland, the ex-chief operating officer of Cambridge Analytica, claims at one point. \u201cThis technology is going on unabated and will continue to go on unabated.[\u2026] There was always going to be a Cambridge Analytica. It just sucks to me that it\u2019s Cambridge Analytica.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t decide democracy was for sale. We built this world, so we should own it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s true that, since the scandal broke, we have discovered that Facebook was <a href=\"https://bgr.com/2019/04/03/facebook-leak-user-records-540-million-app-developers-cultura/\" title=\"\">leaking data </a><a href=\"https://bgr.com/2019/04/03/facebook-leak-user-records-540-million-app-developers-cultura/\" title=\"\">all over the place</a> over many years. But, in the film, Wheatland conveniently glosses over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s more singular attributes, such as offering \u201celectoral services\u201d that included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/19/cambridge-analytica-execs-boast-dirty-tricks-honey-traps-elections\" title=\"\">entrapment using Ukrainian prostitutes</a> and admitting to <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/05/meet-the-real-alexander-nix-an-interview-with-the-notorious-former-head-of-cambridge-analytica/\" title=\"\">bribing officials in Caribbean elections</a>. But having worked for more than a year to bring Wylie forward, it\u2019s fascinating for me now to glimpse how the scandal continued to unfold.</p> \n<p>Wheatland describes what it was like to be inside a news tsunami: at its height, he says, they were dealing with an almost fantastical 35,000 news stories a day.</p> \n<p><em>The Great Hack</em> is the work of Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, the husband-and-wife team who made <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXczUzzCfQY\" title=\"\">The Square</a></em>, the Oscar-nominated film about the Arab spring. Here, they tell the story via the personal journeys of two contrasting individuals: <a href=\"https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/faculty/david-carroll/\" title=\"\">David Carroll</a>, a New York media professor who attempts a circuitous, difficult and ultimately unsuccessful journey via the English legal system to find out what data Cambridge Analytica held on him; and Brittany Kaiser, an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica who turned \u201cwhistleblower\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iX8GxLP1FHo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iX8GxLP1FHo\">Watch a trailer for The Great Hack</a>. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Carroll\u2019s doomed attempt to lift the veil from the data-industrial complex that underpinned Cambridge Analytica is the dark heart of the film. Because although he proved that the firm had <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/2260271/investigation-into-the-use-of-data-analytics-in-political-campaigns-final-20181105.pdf\" title=\"\">illegally processed his data</a>, ultimately his attempt to retrieve that data was thwarted by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s decision to liquidate.</p> \n<p>Carroll\u2019s experience is just one of the many unknowns that still surround this story. We still know very little about what the company actually did with the data. Who was targeted? With what ads? In what locations?<em><strong> </strong></em>Carroll knows nothing about the nature of the 5,000 data points the firm claimed, in its own marketing, to have on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/the-ceo-of-cambridge-analytica-plans-a-book-on-its-methods-and-the-us-election/?guccounter=1\" title=\"\">230 million American voters</a>, including himself. We still have no clear picture what Cambridge Analytica did for Trump. Or what it did in any of the dozens of elections worldwide it claimed to have worked on \u2013 what Carroll calls \u201csubversion on an industrial scale\u201d. All we know is that both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent the facts coming out.</p> \n<p>The data swamp remains dark, toxic and invisible. But what the film tries to do through creative and unusual graphics is to make the invisible visible: pixels representing data bytes float off Carroll as he rides the subway \u2013 the informational exhaust fumes we give off, hundreds of thousands of data points every day, which are hoovered up and monetised by the tech monopoly giants in ways we can\u2019t see or understand.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3e3a85e4-bb4d-46db-986f-c01234b00e91\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(December 11, 2015)</i>&nbsp;<strong>First hint of the scandal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data\">The Guardian reports</a>&nbsp;that political data firm Cambridge Analytica was helping&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/ted-cruz/\">Ted Cruz</a>'s presidential campaign, suggesting the Republican candidate was using psychological data based on research into tens of millions of Facebook users&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/cambridge-analytica-accused-of-violating-election-law-by-common-cause.html\">in an attempt to gain an advantage</a> over his political rivals</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(June 1, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong>Firm works with Trump campaign </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><br>Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy firm of which Steve Bannon is vice-president, starts working with Trump campaign aide Brad Parscale in San Antonio, alongside employees from Facebook and Google.

But it springs from the unlikeliest of places: the techno-optimism of the Arab spring, the revolutions that were widely greeted as proving the liberating effects of this new technology. The couple met in Egypt\u2019s Tahrir Square during the months-long protest in 2011. Noujaim was filming and Amer was organising, but they ended up working together on the film that became <em>The Square</em>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe saw first-hand how this technology was this incredible tool for change,\u201d says Noujaim. \u201cI was arrested, and it was a human rights lawyer tweeting my picture that became the only way they could find me.\u201d</p> \n<p>This led the couple to try to find a story about technology, but gradually it morphed into a very different film.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe started out looking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/03/sony-hack-leaked-emails-hollywood-documentary\" title=\"\">the Sony hack</a> [the cyberattack on emails at Sony Pictures in 2014], but soon felt that the hack that was most interesting was not the physical hack but the brain one: the manipulation that was happening to our minds.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b1b0103d635cd310ecb38c94816f194b0eb4dabc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b0103d635cd310ecb38c94816f194b0eb4dabc/0_0_3148_3993/788.jpg\" alt=\"The Observer front page, Sunday 18 March 2018.\" width=\"788\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Observer front page, Sunday 18 March 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The project mutated, moving its focus first to the US election and then to the trillion-dollar-a-year data industry, and took so long that they had three children (including twins) while filming it, across three continents. In the summer of 2017 they approached me to be a \u201ccharacter\u201d, an offer I declined (although a year later I relented and did a couple of interviews). More important, I introduced them to experts I\u2019d found on Twitter: David Carroll, associate professor of media design at Parsons School of Design in New York; <a href=\"https://paulolivier.dehaye.org/\" title=\"\">Paul-Olivier Dehaye</a>, a data rights expert in Switzerland who had helped me research and understand Cambridge Analytica, and <a href=\"https://www.itnsolicitors.com/our-team/partners/ravi-naik\" title=\"\">Ravi Naik</a>, Carroll\u2019s (and my) London-based human rights lawyer, who believes data rights represent the next great human rights battle.</p> \n<p>The film chronicles Carroll\u2019s attempt to assert his rights to his data under UK law, and for him, it was about telling the parts of the story that the US press almost entirely failed to grasp.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis was a military contractor that got into the business of election management. That alone is so unsettling. Everyone got so fixated on the Facebook data. My case proved that what Cambridge Analytica was doing with US voters\u2019 data was illegal [under English law]. The story is about so much more than misappropriated Facebook data. In fact, that\u2019s the least troublesome part of the grand narrative that <em>The Great Hack</em> puts forward.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is so much that is troublesome, including, Carroll points out, the other central figure in the film, the Cambridge Analytica \u201cwhistleblower\u201d Brittany Kaiser. Whistleblowers are often complex and contradictory, and Kaiser, a former senior director at the company, comes across as elusive and evasive.</p> \n<p>Amer says that he met Kaiser for the first time, as we do in the film, in a pool in Thailand in bikini and sunglasses, her eyes hidden. We never find out why she\u2019s in the pool, or in Thailand, for that matter. There is no mention of the fact that she decided to blow the whistle the day after the<em> Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analytica-offered-politicians-hacked-emails-witnesses-say?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">published a story</a> on her involvement in an allegedly criminal smear campaign in the Nigerian 2015 election that was extreme even by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s standards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdbce71c1eb90eb52901aa9938010348e70b0be0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdbce71c1eb90eb52901aa9938010348e70b0be0/0_0_2250_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Carroll in a scene from The Great Hack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Carroll in a scene from The Great Hack.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ambiguity of Kaiser\u2019s involvement \u201cechoes our own complicity\u201d, Amer says, \u201cbecause we all played a part in this. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s Cambridge Analytica\u2019s fault that the entire democratic process has been commoditised and you can buy and sell all this data. It\u2019s not Cambridge Analytica\u2019s fault that the US election is a multi-billion-dollar market. Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t decide democracy was for sale, we allowed that. We built this world, so we should own it\u2026 and not just point fingers at people who exploited it.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a neat argument, but some are perhaps more complicit than others. Noujaim and Amer treat Kaiser in good faith and call her story a \u201credemption narrative\u201d. But to others \u2013 including Wylie, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s former research director, and Carroll \u2013 she\u2019s an unreliable narrator. The narrative, Carroll says, is one that has netted her a \u201chigh six-figure advance\u201d for a biography coming out later this year. \u201cI hope people can see the difference between those who are monetising the Cambridge Analytica story and those who are doing the work.\u201d</p> \n<p>And the film\u2019s omissions of parts of Kaiser\u2019s story are a shame. I spent months tracking down ex-employees who claimed their lives were put at risk after Kaiser brought in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/cambridge-analyticas-ruthless-bid-to-sway-the-vote-in-nigeria\" title=\"\">a team of Israeli intelligence agents for the Nigerian election campaign</a> who hacked the current president\u2019s emails. Employees describe how they were directed to search through these to find damaging material to leak to the press. There were \u201cuncanny\u201d echoes, employees said, of what happened with WikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in the US election 18 months later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>People have completely misunderstood the scandal as being about privacy, when it\u2019s actually about power</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There\u2019s no mention of that in the film, though. There are moments when Carroll expresses scepticism about Kaiser, and, most dramatically \u2013 just as the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, is being questioned by a select committee of British MPs about why he contacted Julian Assange to ask him for Clinton\u2019s emails \u2013 we learn that Kaiser had her own contact with WikiLeaks.

In the book, Zuboff creates a framework and a language for understanding this new world. She believes <em>The Great Hack</em> is an important landmark in terms of public understanding, and that Noujaim and Amer capture \u201cwhat living under the conditions of surveillance capitalism means. That every action is being repurposed as raw material for behavioural data. And that these data are being lifted from our lives in ways that are systematically engineered to be invisible. And therefore we can never resist.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d26ed30483d8b9868401b33a099da4cb51fcb82\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d26ed30483d8b9868401b33a099da4cb51fcb82/0_184_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brittany Kaiser, former director of Cambridge Analytica, at a screening of The Great Hack at Sundance in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brittany Kaiser, former director of Cambridge Analytica, at a screening of The Great Hack at Sundance in January.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images for Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She, too, is troubled by the multiple questions that the scandal raised and that remain unanswered. And she\u2019s exasperated by the people who scoff at the idea that what Cambridge Analytica did was some sort of \u201cdark arts\u201d. The whole point is that we just don\u2019t know what really happened, she says. There has been no forensic analysis. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because the data doesn\u2019t exist. It does. It\u2019s just that Facebook is sitting on it. That\u2019s why we need the law. What they want is for this to be so obfuscated, so difficult to get to the bottom of it, that we just let it fade into this kind of haze of \u2018Well, it seemed really bad, but we just don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe it was overblown.\u2019 And doubt fills the void.\u201d</p> \n<p>For Zuboff, Cambridge Analytica has demonstrated how it\u2019s possible for any motivated billionaire to leverage tools to build his own scaled-down version of the massive surveillance and manipulation machines that are Google and Facebook.</p> \n<p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/facebook-fine-ftc-privacy-violations\" title=\"\">Facebook was fined $5bn</a> for its part in the scandal by the US Federal Trade Commission, one of dozens of ongoing investigations into the company around the world.

We know now that we\u2019re guinea pigs in a vast global, online experiment. We just have no idea what that means.</p> \n<p>The film is the first major creative project to grapple with the subject in all its complexity. David Carroll\u2019s single-minded mission and Brittany Kaiser\u2019s erratic transatlantic meanderings provide a personal frame to these larger unanswered questions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"677d063e-efea-4f10-b191-0180a936b2e4\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Cambridge Analytica files resulted in a multi-year investigation from the UK Information Commissioner's Office, \"the most important ever\", according to Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner.</p>\n    <p>In an interim report, published in July 2018, the ICO announced a number of enforcement actions against a whole spectrum of political actors, including:</p>\n    <p>\u2022 A \u00a3500,000 fine against Facebook for two breaches of the Data Protection act.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Warning letters to all 11 political parties with MPs in the House of Commons, and notices compelling them to agree to audits of their data protection practices.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 An enforcement notice for Cambridge Analytica's parent SCL Elections to compel it to deal properly with a subject access request from US Professor David Carroll, whose data it held, which has already led to a criminal prosecution for for failing to properly deal the notice.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 An enforcement notice for Canadian electoral services firm Aggregate IQ, ordering it to stop processing retained data belonging to UK citizens which was provided by Vote Leave.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 A notice of intent to take regulatory action against data broker Emma\u2019s Diary, which sold data about new mothers to political parties that had been collected in a \"concerning\" fashion.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Audits of the main credit reference companies.</p>\n    <p>\u2022 An audit of of the Cambridge University Psychometric Centre, where Alexander Kogan worked</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the few slivers of insight we have into how Cambridge Analytica and Facebook worked together on the Trump campaign comes from a clip used in <em>The Great Hack </em>from a BBC documentary, in which journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiebartlett\" title=\"\">Jamie Bartlett</a> interviews a member of Trump\u2019s digital team who shows where employees of the two companies worked alongside one another.</p> \n<p>Parscale told a conference recently that the day the Facebook employees arrived was like getting a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tudormihailescu/2019/03/24/trump-campaign-chief-outlines-1-billion-strategy-for-2020-on-trip-to-romania/#6a9c27111647\" title=\"\">\u201cChristmas present\u201d</a>. He recalled the time he told the Trump campaign that Facebook was \u201cthe 500 pound gorilla that\u2019s ready for picking.

We know nothing of the modelling that was used, or of the three voter suppression operations that a campaign official told a journalist ahead of the election that they were running. Or almost anything at all. It is all still wrapped in darkness.</p> \n<p>Paul-Olivier Dehaye goes as far as to suggest that, in investigating links between Trump and Russia, we are looking in the wrong place for evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d, and describes a scenario that is \u201cmore subtle, delicate and dangerous\u201d than any of those presently understood. Collusion, he says, \u201cmay have been enabled by Facebook\u201d, its algorithms exploited by \u201cadversarial machine learning\u201d. A malevolent actor, he says, could for example create fake profiles of Hillary supporters, and then use those profiles to train Facebook\u2019s algorithm in a way that would benefit Trump\u2019s campaign.</p> \n<p>We know Facebook co-operated with Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry, but there\u2019s no hint in the redacted report of what he found. Just as we don\u2019t know when Facebook\u2019s executives first learned about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities. More than a year on, that most basic question \u2013 who at Facebook knew what, when? \u2013 has simply not been answered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"deecd5d51e4f70a859d46a55f7b496658001953a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/deecd5d51e4f70a859d46a55f7b496658001953a/0_0_2257_2257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoshana Zuboff, who coined the term \u2018surveillance capitalism\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoshana Zuboff, who coined the term \u2018surveillance capitalism\u2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe saw what happened to Facebook\u2019s share price in the wake of the scandal,\u201d says <a href=\"https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/dcn-staff/jason-kint/\" title=\"\">Jason Kint</a>, the CEO of Digital Content Next, who has been an assiduous observer of the ongoing investigations. \u201cIf executives had information that they didn\u2019t tell shareholders, that\u2019s a very big deal.\u201d Facebook has said it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7e5a96c-45f6-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3\" title=\"\">co-operating with investigations</a>, which it takes seriously.</p> \n<p>Although the Cambridge Analytica scandal is a lot about Facebook, it doesn\u2019t mean Cambridge Analytica can be let off the hook. It doesn\u2019t make the questions about its activities any less troubling.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a gobsmacking moment, captured in the film, when Kaiser tells the select committee that the British government had classified Cambridge Analytica\u2019s technology as \u201cweapons-grade\u201d. It was export\u2011controlled, meaning the company was bound by law to tell the government if it used it overseas. <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/damian-collins/3986\" title=\"\">Damian Collins</a>, chair of the committee, is seen digesting this piece of information, and asking: \u201cSo what you are saying is that the proposal was for Leave.EU to use what you call \u2018weapons grade communications techniques\u2019 against the UK population?\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s worth reading that sentence again. There\u2019s no conspiracy here, just important unanswered questions. Did the British government have oversight of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities in multiple elections worldwide? Was this \u201cweapons grade\u201d technology used on the British population?</p> \n<p>And it\u2019s worth restating what kicked off the entire story. It was only when Cambridge Analytica started writing repeatedly to me, furiously denying any involvement in the EU referendum \u2013 despite having previously boasted about it in multiple places online \u2013 that I started investigating this byzantine web of people, data and money.</p> \n<p>The official position, including that of the Electoral Commission, is that Cambridge Analytica did no work for Leave.EU.

      "bodyText": "Cambridge Analytica may have become the byword for a scandal, but it\u2019s not entirely clear that anyone knows exactly what that scandal is. It\u2019s more like toxic word association: \u201cFacebook\u201d, \u201cdata\u201d, \u201charvested\u201d, \u201cweaponised\u201d, \u201cTrump\u201d and, in this country, most controversially, \u201cBrexit\u201d. It was a media firestorm that\u2019s yet to be extinguished, a year on from whistleblower Christopher Wylie\u2019s revelations in the Observer and the New York Times about how the company acquired the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users in order to target them in political campaigns. This week sees the release of The Great Hack, a Netflix documentary that is the first feature-length attempt to gather all the strands of the affair into some sort of narrative \u2013 though it is one contested even by those appearing in the film. \u201cThis is not about one company,\u201d Julian Wheatland, the ex-chief operating officer of Cambridge Analytica, claims at one point. \u201cThis technology is going on unabated and will continue to go on unabated.[\u2026] There was always going to be a Cambridge Analytica. It just sucks to me that it\u2019s Cambridge Analytica.\u201d It\u2019s true that, since the scandal broke, we have discovered that Facebook was leaking data all over the place over many years. But, in the film, Wheatland conveniently glosses over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s more singular attributes, such as offering \u201celectoral services\u201d that included entrapment using Ukrainian prostitutes and admitting to bribing officials in Caribbean elections. But having worked for more than a year to bring Wylie forward, it\u2019s fascinating for me now to glimpse how the scandal continued to unfold. Wheatland describes what it was like to be inside a news tsunami: at its height, he says, they were dealing with an almost fantastical 35,000 news stories a day. The Great Hack is the work of Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, the husband-and-wife team who made The Square, the Oscar-nominated film about the Arab spring. Here, they tell the story via the personal journeys of two contrasting individuals: David Carroll, a New York media professor who attempts a circuitous, difficult and ultimately unsuccessful journey via the English legal system to find out what data Cambridge Analytica held on him; and Brittany Kaiser, an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica who turned \u201cwhistleblower\u201d. Carroll\u2019s doomed attempt to lift the veil from the data-industrial complex that underpinned Cambridge Analytica is the dark heart of the film. Because although he proved that the firm had illegally processed his data, ultimately his attempt to retrieve that data was thwarted by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s decision to liquidate. Carroll\u2019s experience is just one of the many unknowns that still surround this story. We still know very little about what the company actually did with the data. Who was targeted? With what ads? In what locations? Carroll knows nothing about the nature of the 5,000 data points the firm claimed, in its own marketing, to have on 230 million American voters, including himself. We still have no clear picture what Cambridge Analytica did for Trump. Or what it did in any of the dozens of elections worldwide it claimed to have worked on \u2013 what Carroll calls \u201csubversion on an industrial scale\u201d. All we know is that both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have gone to extraordinary lengths to prevent the facts coming out. The data swamp remains dark, toxic and invisible. But what the film tries to do through creative and unusual graphics is to make the invisible visible: pixels representing data bytes float off Carroll as he rides the subway \u2013 the informational exhaust fumes we give off, hundreds of thousands of data points every day, which are hoovered up and monetised by the tech monopoly giants in ways we can\u2019t see or understand. Exposing this invisible world of manipulation and power is one of the principal aims of the film, according to Amer and Noujaim. But it springs from the unlikeliest of places: the techno-optimism of the Arab spring, the revolutions that were widely greeted as proving the liberating effects of this new technology. The couple met in Egypt\u2019s Tahrir Square during the months-long protest in 2011. Noujaim was filming and Amer was organising, but they ended up working together on the film that became The Square. \u201cWe saw first-hand how this technology was this incredible tool for change,\u201d says Noujaim. \u201cI was arrested, and it was a human rights lawyer tweeting my picture that became the only way they could find me.\u201d This led the couple to try to find a story about technology, but gradually it morphed into a very different film. \u201cWe started out looking at the Sony hack [the cyberattack on emails at Sony Pictures in 2014], but soon felt that the hack that was most interesting was not the physical hack but the brain one: the manipulation that was happening to our minds.\u201d The project mutated, moving its focus first to the US election and then to the trillion-dollar-a-year data industry, and took so long that they had three children (including twins) while filming it, across three continents. In the summer of 2017 they approached me to be a \u201ccharacter\u201d, an offer I declined (although a year later I relented and did a couple of interviews). More important, I introduced them to experts I\u2019d found on Twitter: David Carroll, associate professor of media design at Parsons School of Design in New York; Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data rights expert in Switzerland who had helped me research and understand Cambridge Analytica, and Ravi Naik, Carroll\u2019s (and my) London-based human rights lawyer, who believes data rights represent the next great human rights battle. The film chronicles Carroll\u2019s attempt to assert his rights to his data under UK law, and for him, it was about telling the parts of the story that the US press almost entirely failed to grasp. \u201cThis was a military contractor that got into the business of election management. That alone is so unsettling. Everyone got so fixated on the Facebook data. My case proved that what Cambridge Analytica was doing with US voters\u2019 data was illegal [under English law]. The story is about so much more than misappropriated Facebook data. In fact, that\u2019s the least troublesome part of the grand narrative that The Great Hack puts forward.\u201d There is so much that is troublesome, including, Carroll points out, the other central figure in the film, the Cambridge Analytica \u201cwhistleblower\u201d Brittany Kaiser. Whistleblowers are often complex and contradictory, and Kaiser, a former senior director at the company, comes across as elusive and evasive. Amer says that he met Kaiser for the first time, as we do in the film, in a pool in Thailand in bikini and sunglasses, her eyes hidden. We never find out why she\u2019s in the pool, or in Thailand, for that matter. There is no mention of the fact that she decided to blow the whistle the day after the Guardian published a story on her involvement in an allegedly criminal smear campaign in the Nigerian 2015 election that was extreme even by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s standards. The ambiguity of Kaiser\u2019s involvement \u201cechoes our own complicity\u201d, Amer says, \u201cbecause we all played a part in this. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s Cambridge Analytica\u2019s fault that the entire democratic process has been commoditised and you can buy and sell all this data. It\u2019s not Cambridge Analytica\u2019s fault that the US election is a multi-billion-dollar market. Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t decide democracy was for sale, we allowed that. We built this world, so we should own it\u2026 and not just point fingers at people who exploited it.\u201d It\u2019s a neat argument, but some are perhaps more complicit than others. Noujaim and Amer treat Kaiser in good faith and call her story a \u201credemption narrative\u201d. But to others \u2013 including Wylie, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s former research director, and Carroll \u2013 she\u2019s an unreliable narrator. The narrative, Carroll says, is one that has netted her a \u201chigh six-figure advance\u201d for a biography coming out later this year. \u201cI hope people can see the difference between those who are monetising the Cambridge Analytica story and those who are doing the work.\u201d And the film\u2019s omissions of parts of Kaiser\u2019s story are a shame. I spent months tracking down ex-employees who claimed their lives were put at risk after Kaiser brought in a team of Israeli intelligence agents for the Nigerian election campaign who hacked the current president\u2019s emails. Employees describe how they were directed to search through these to find damaging material to leak to the press. There were \u201cuncanny\u201d echoes, employees said, of what happened with WikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in the US election 18 months later. There\u2019s no mention of that in the film, though. There are moments when Carroll expresses scepticism about Kaiser, and, most dramatically \u2013 just as the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, is being questioned by a select committee of British MPs about why he contacted Julian Assange to ask him for Clinton\u2019s emails \u2013 we learn that Kaiser had her own contact with WikiLeaks. The viewer finds out about this because I wrote a story about it \u2013 in June 2018, with Guardian journalist Stephanie Kirchgaessner \u2013 and in the film we see Kaiser reacting to news of the story in real time. \u201cCarole knows I visited Julian Assange in February,\u201d she says tearfully, after reading a message on her phone. \u201cAnd she knows I gave money to WikiLeaks in bitcoin.\u201d Later, she reveals she has been subpoenaed by US justice department special counsel Robert Mueller and is seen travelling to give evidence. (Her lawyer later said she had \u201cdischarged her obligations\u201d.) Kaiser has brought forward important evidence, but has also been reluctant to acknowledge her own complicated role. She was asked by MPs about her relationship with WikiLeaks and omitted to mention her visit to Assange. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but in your life have you worked for or provided information to any country\u2019s intelligence agencies?\u201d Ian Lucas, Labour MP for Wrexham, asks her at the parliamentary hearing. The film captures the moment of her response, a single alarming eyebrow that shoots up. According to Shoshana Zuboff, professor emerita at Harvard Business School, the Cambridge Analytica scandal was a landmark moment, because it revealed a micro version \u201cof the larger phenomenon that is surveillance capitalism\u201d. Zuboff is responsible for formulating the concept of surveillance capitalism, and published a magisterial, indispensible book with that title soon after the scandal broke. In the book, Zuboff creates a framework and a language for understanding this new world. She believes The Great Hack is an important landmark in terms of public understanding, and that Noujaim and Amer capture \u201cwhat living under the conditions of surveillance capitalism means. That every action is being repurposed as raw material for behavioural data. And that these data are being lifted from our lives in ways that are systematically engineered to be invisible. And therefore we can never resist.\u201d She, too, is troubled by the multiple questions that the scandal raised and that remain unanswered. And she\u2019s exasperated by the people who scoff at the idea that what Cambridge Analytica did was some sort of \u201cdark arts\u201d. The whole point is that we just don\u2019t know what really happened, she says. There has been no forensic analysis. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because the data doesn\u2019t exist. It does. It\u2019s just that Facebook is sitting on it. That\u2019s why we need the law. What they want is for this to be so obfuscated, so difficult to get to the bottom of it, that we just let it fade into this kind of haze of \u2018Well, it seemed really bad, but we just don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe it was overblown.\u2019 And doubt fills the void.\u201d For Zuboff, Cambridge Analytica has demonstrated how it\u2019s possible for any motivated billionaire to leverage tools to build his own scaled-down version of the massive surveillance and manipulation machines that are Google and Facebook. Last week, Facebook was fined $5bn for its part in the scandal by the US Federal Trade Commission, one of dozens of ongoing investigations into the company around the world. Facebook is being scrutinised, if not actually held to account ($5bn has no meaningful impact on a company of its size and scale). But Cambridge Analytica\u2019s central role in the US election and its contested role in Brexit remain a mystery. Martin Moore, an academic at King\u2019s College London and the author of an excellent book on the wider subject, Democracy Hacked, suggests that this is because Cambridge Analytica\u2019s key players have come to be seen as \u201cpantomime villains\u201d. The undercover Channel 4 film aired in the same week as the Observer revelations, he suggests, gave people the licence to dismiss them. \u201cThe message that people took away from that was that there\u2019s no substance to what they were doing at all,\u201d says Moore. \u201cThere was this bizarre situation where journalists were falling over themselves to say that this digital media was really overhyped, that it didn\u2019t really make any difference, when we have no idea what was done, and it\u2019s incredibly premature to say we can dismiss all this stuff. We know that Brad Parscale [Trump\u2019s digital director] was putting out 50-60,000 ads per day [during the 2016 US presidential election] and using AI on those ads. And we know that AI has moved on significantly since then.\u201d Even as the US remains in the dark about what happened in 2016, Trump is accelerating towards the next election; Parscale has revealed a war chest of $1bn and is spending $1m a week on Facebook ads. Cambridge Analytica is dead, but it\u2019s the living dead. Zombie sons of the company live on, including Data Propria, which is now working on the Trump2020 campaign and, most directly, in Emerdata, a company that was set up by Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, the daughters of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s original owner, Robert Mercer, alongside Alexander Nix and \u2013 later \u2013 Julian Wheatland (though both men have since resigned). It\u2019s extraordinary that, despite the headlines and the articles and the congressional and parliamentary hearings, there is so much we still don\u2019t know about what Cambridge Analytica actually did. We know now that we\u2019re guinea pigs in a vast global, online experiment. We just have no idea what that means. The film is the first major creative project to grapple with the subject in all its complexity. David Carroll\u2019s single-minded mission and Brittany Kaiser\u2019s erratic transatlantic meanderings provide a personal frame to these larger unanswered questions. One of the few slivers of insight we have into how Cambridge Analytica and Facebook worked together on the Trump campaign comes from a clip used in The Great Hack from a BBC documentary, in which journalist Jamie Bartlett interviews a member of Trump\u2019s digital team who shows where employees of the two companies worked alongside one another. Parscale told a conference recently that the day the Facebook employees arrived was like getting a \u201cChristmas present\u201d. He recalled the time he told the Trump campaign that Facebook was \u201cthe 500 pound gorilla that\u2019s ready for picking. Who controls Facebook controls the 2016 election.\u201d Yet only a fraction of the 5.9m ads that were pumped out by the campaign have ever been seen by the wider public. We know nothing of the modelling that was used, or of the three voter suppression operations that a campaign official told a journalist ahead of the election that they were running. Or almost anything at all. It is all still wrapped in darkness. Paul-Olivier Dehaye goes as far as to suggest that, in investigating links between Trump and Russia, we are looking in the wrong place for evidence of \u201ccollusion\u201d, and describes a scenario that is \u201cmore subtle, delicate and dangerous\u201d than any of those presently understood. Collusion, he says, \u201cmay have been enabled by Facebook\u201d, its algorithms exploited by \u201cadversarial machine learning\u201d. A malevolent actor, he says, could for example create fake profiles of Hillary supporters, and then use those profiles to train Facebook\u2019s algorithm in a way that would benefit Trump\u2019s campaign. We know Facebook co-operated with Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry, but there\u2019s no hint in the redacted report of what he found. Just as we don\u2019t know when Facebook\u2019s executives first learned about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities. More than a year on, that most basic question \u2013 who at Facebook knew what, when? \u2013 has simply not been answered. \u201cWe saw what happened to Facebook\u2019s share price in the wake of the scandal,\u201d says Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, who has been an assiduous observer of the ongoing investigations. \u201cIf executives had information that they didn\u2019t tell shareholders, that\u2019s a very big deal.\u201d Facebook has said it is co-operating with investigations, which it takes seriously. Although the Cambridge Analytica scandal is a lot about Facebook, it doesn\u2019t mean Cambridge Analytica can be let off the hook. It doesn\u2019t make the questions about its activities any less troubling. There\u2019s a gobsmacking moment, captured in the film, when Kaiser tells the select committee that the British government had classified Cambridge Analytica\u2019s technology as \u201cweapons-grade\u201d. It was export\u2011controlled, meaning the company was bound by law to tell the government if it used it overseas. Damian Collins, chair of the committee, is seen digesting this piece of information, and asking: \u201cSo what you are saying is that the proposal was for Leave.EU to use what you call \u2018weapons grade communications techniques\u2019 against the UK population?\u201d It\u2019s worth reading that sentence again. There\u2019s no conspiracy here, just important unanswered questions. Did the British government have oversight of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities in multiple elections worldwide? Was this \u201cweapons grade\u201d technology used on the British population? And it\u2019s worth restating what kicked off the entire story. It was only when Cambridge Analytica started writing repeatedly to me, furiously denying any involvement in the EU referendum \u2013 despite having previously boasted about it in multiple places online \u2013 that I started investigating this byzantine web of people, data and money. The official position, including that of the Electoral Commission, is that Cambridge Analytica did no work for Leave.EU. However, that is not the impression left by the film. Collins says, \u201cWe\u2019ve documented how Cambridge Analytica worked with Leave.EU, regardless of whether they were paid or not. There are still so many unanswered questions that require further investigation. \u201cThe film does a brilliant job of telling the story of the central role data plays in politics, and the way a few big companies can get inside the heads of millions of people.\u201d Will we ever know the truth, I ask Zuboff. \u201cIf today\u2019s lawmakers and researchers can\u2019t answer these questions, they\u2019re going to ring through history,\u201d she says. Dehaye describes it as an \u201cabysmal\u201d state of affairs that \u201cwe cannot even establish basic facts about potential illegalities by five different actors \u2013 Cambridge Analytica, [Alex] Kogan [the academic who mined the Facebook data], the platform, the politicians and the Russians. That\u2019s five different actors involved in using this technology. And we don\u2019t have access to even the most basic information about what they did.\u201d Still, he\u2019s upbeat when I speak to him just after he\u2019s watched the film. \u201cI feel pretty good,\u201d he says. \u201cIn December 2016, I reached out to 10 Americans like David [Carroll] with this idea for an experiment [in which] they would ask for their data through European courts. And now it\u2019s a Netflix movie. So that feels good, even if I don\u2019t have any money or income right now.\u201d Carroll risked his own money, too. Because nobody pays for any of this, it\u2019s been a citizens\u2019 fight \u2013 academics and activists, alongside journalists, backbench MPs and film-makers. The little guy up against the big guy, where the big guys have all the money in the world \u2013 the technology behind this has created the wealthiest and most powerful companies on Earth. \u201cPeople have completely misunderstood the scandal as being about privacy,\u201d says Naik, \u201cwhen it\u2019s actually about power.\u201d And the idea that people are dismissing any of this because they think it doesn\u2019t \u201cwork perfectly\u201d is a terrifying proposition, Zuboff believes. \u201cThese are monopolies pouring the might of capital into a population-scale experiment and then figuring out how to make it work better and better. This is an infinite curve that has infinite resources and that\u2019s the road we\u2019re on.\u201d After a near five-year struggle to make their film, and to highlight what they call \u201cthe wreckage sites\u201d of surveillance capitalism, Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim believe that the fightback is in full swing. \u201cIt was an amazing moment for us when we met you all, these sleuths who\u2019d found each other online and were using these different ways of hacking the system back.\u201d Most days, it\u2019s hard to see it that way: because most days, the companies are winning. \u201cThe story revealed this huge gaping wound in Silicon Valley where we could see what this beast was,\u201d says Naik. \u201cBut we ended up just peering over the edge.\u201d We\u2019re still there now. Suffering vertigo. Or confusion. The complexity of this story and the ability of those involved to spin it \u2013 corporate lobbyist Nick Clegg\u2019s recent round of interviews on behalf of Facebook is just one example \u2013 is one of the greatest barriers to people understanding it. For Zuboff, the Cambridge Analytica scandal was the beginning of the great awakening. And The Great Hack is a crucial start of the next stage: \u201cBecause now we need action,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need law. We have to solve this.\u201d The Great Hack is available on Netflix and showing at the ICA, London SW1, from 24 July",

      "bodyText": "Authorities in Florida have launched an investigation into whether the financier Jeffrey Epstein was properly monitored during a 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, the product of a controversial 2008 deal with federal authorities. The inquiry will focus on whether deputies assigned to monitor Epstein in a work-release program violated any rules or regulations, Palm Beach county sheriff Ric Bradshaw said on Friday. \u201cAll aspects of the matter will be fully investigated to ensure total accountability and transparency,\u201d Bradshaw said. Under the widely criticized deal, Epstein, now 66, avoided federal prosecution on charges he sexually abused and trafficked minors. He pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and registered as a low-level sex offender. Epstein joined a work-release program that permitted him to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week at an office rather than in the county jail. Earlier this month, Epstein was arrested in New York on federal charges of sex trafficking involving underage victims. He pleaded not guilty. The arrest set off huge media interest, given Epstein\u2019s links to powerful men including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. More women who allege Epstein sexually assaulted them have come forward. This week, he was denied bail. Criticism of the 2008 deal led to the resignation last week of labor secretary Alexander Acosta, who oversaw the deal while he was a federal prosecutor in Miami. The state sentence is also under scrutiny. According to Palm Beach county sheriff\u2019s records released to the Associated Press, though it stipulated an 8am to 8pm schedule, Epstein\u2019s personal limousine picked him up from jail as early as 7.15am and dropped him off as late as 10.40pm. Epstein was permitted to join work-release after a little more than three months in jail. Sex offenders are now banned from work-release, but apparently were not in 2008. On Thursday, local station WPTV reported that other records from the Palm Beach sheriff showed Epstein making stops at his home \u2013 some as long as three hours \u2013 on at least eight occasions. Pam Beach sheriff\u2019s deputy Mike Gauger said Epstein was closely monitored, was not allowed to wander or go out for lunch and had visitors logged. One of the deputies assigned to guard Epstein at his office told the AP he recalled young women visiting, but could not say if there was any inappropriate contact because he was stationed in the lobby, with two doors between himself and Epstein. \u201cI do remember young women coming in and going back into the office area,\u201d said the now-retired deputy, Jeffrey Rice. \u201cEarly 20s, maybe. They just kind of said they were office assistants.\u201d Last week, Bradley Edwards, a Florida attorney who has represented a number of women who sued Acosta for withholding information about the federal deal from 36 underage alleged victims, accused Epstein of engaging in \u201cimproper sexual contact\u201d during his sentence. He did not identify the women allegedly involved. The Palm Beach investigation comes amid a run of new claims against Epstein, who faces up to 45 years in prison. On Thursday judge Richard Berman denied bail, agreeing with prosecutors that Epstein was a flight risk and a danger to the community. Edwards\u2019 accusations are based on the work of Michael Fisten, a private detective who says two women say they were brought from another state at the age of 18 to visit Epstein at his office in Florida while he was on work-release. In interviews with the New York Times and CNN, Fisten said the women reported that their meetings with Epstein turned sexual in nature. Epstein, he said, was naked during the alleged encounters except for a court-ordered GPS ankle monitor. There was sexual activity that included physical contact, he said. Fisten declined to discuss specifics and said he had been unable to obtain work-release visitor logs. \u201cWe wanted to get those logs so we could see who the girls were,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re missing. No one knows where they are.\u201d In a statement, the Palm Beach sheriff\u2019s department said it took \u201cthese matters very seriously and wants to determine if any actions taken by the deputies assigned to monitor Epstein during his work-release programme violated any agency rules and regulations.\u201d Fisten said he witnessed private investigators hired by Epstein trying to frighten and harassed accusers. In one instance, Fisten said, an accuser\u2019s father was run off the road. \u201cThey were former Miami cops,\u201d Fisten said. \u201cHe paid an extremely large retainer to them and all their job to do was to follow the girls around and intimidate them.\u201d Prosecutors in New York argued during bail hearings that Epstein had wired $350,000 to two people soon after a Miami Herald expos\u00e9 last November drew renewed attention to claims against him. Epstein has never been charged with obstruction of justice or witness tampering.",

He was born in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford, the setting for several of his books, and educated at University College Dublin. His novels include <em>The Master</em>, <em>Nora Webster</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/27/house-of-names-colm-toibin-review\" title=\"\">The House of Names.</a></em> The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan\" title=\"\">film adaptation of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/brooklyn-observer-film-review-saoirse-ronan\" title=\"\">Brooklyn</a></em>, about a young Irish emigrant to New York, earned three Oscar nominations in 2015. His latest book, <em>Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know: The Fathers of Wilde, Yeats and Joyce</em>, is published by Penguin this week.</p> <p><strong>When did you get the idea to write a book about the fathers of Joyce, Yeats and Wilde?</strong><br>It began with an invite from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, to give the 2017 Ellmann lectures, which are in honour of Richard Ellmann, the great American critic and biographer of Joyce, Yeats and Wilde. I started to think about all three writers and because I had loved that book of Yeats\u2019s father\u2019s letters [<em>Letters to His Son WB Yeats and Others, 1869-1922</em> by John Butler Yeats]. I started to think of them in relation to their fathers and decided that would be my subject. By the time I had written the lectures, I found myself having nearly written a book.</p> <p><strong>Fathers and mothers are often at the heart of your work...</strong><br>I am interested in families and what family does. It\u2019s not as though I make a deliberate decision to write about it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/30/colm-toibin-interview-brooklyn-brexit\" title=\"\">it just comes up in book after book</a>. Even in the novel I am writing, it\u2019s just coming in again.</p> <p><strong>Is there a connection with the death of your </strong><strong>father when you were </strong><strong>13?</strong><br>I think it\u2019s about not having had those arguments that anybody of my generation in Ireland would have had with their father about nationalism, about Catholicism. I suppose that was something I missed, and I\u2019m always exploring what it would have been like.</p> <p><strong>What is your take on the new wave of Irish novelists such as </strong><strong>Sally Rooney</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Anna Burns</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Eimear McBride</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I think they come straight out of Irish modernism. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/10/guardian-book-club-eimear-mcbride-how-i-wrote-a-girl-is-a-half-formed-thing\" title=\"\">Eimear McBride</a>, you can see how much she\u2019s taken from Joyce and how much nourishment Joyce can still offer a writer. If you look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/08/normal-people-sally-rooney-novel-literary-phenomenon-of-decade\" title=\"\">Sally Rooney</a>, Anna Burns, Kevin Barry and Mike McCormack, there is an extraordinary struggle with form and language and it is a sort of miracle that this has come around again. It seems to be continuing even in nonfiction with writers such as Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/02/constellations-reflections-from-life-sinead-gleeson-review\" title=\"\">her extraordinary collection of essays,</a> <em>Constellations</em>. You could attribute this to various things, but I suspect the explanation is more personal than political or national. You can\u2019t rationalise it; it\u2019s mysterious and fascinating, rather than being the direct result of a set of political events.</p> <p><strong>You spend much of your time now in the US</strong><strong>. If you could require </strong><strong>Donald Trump</strong><strong> to read one book, what would it be?</strong><br>I think Trump is beyond that. You could have a lot of fun thinking of books for Clinton and Obama, but you can\u2019t really do it with Trump. It\u2019s not as though he could be improved in any way. No, I would suggest to him to leave books alone now.</p> <p><strong>Wh</strong><strong>ich books are on your bedside table?</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/28/asghar-and-zahra-sameer-rahim-review\" title=\"\">Asghar and Zahra </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/28/asghar-and-zahra-sameer-rahim-review\" title=\"\">by Sameer Rahim</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/28/asghar-and-zahra-sameer-rahim-review\" title=\"\"> </a></em>\u2013 it\u2019s a novel set in London about one of those tight-knit, African Muslim communities. Because I liked <em>Home Fire</em> by Kamila Shamsie, I am totally interested in the idea of somebody actually writing about what\u2019s going on in England now in relation to outsiders. There is also Joseph O\u2019Connor\u2019s <em>Shadow Play</em>, which is a seriously fascinating story of Bram Stoker leaving Ireland, going to work with Henry Irving and creating <em>Dracula</em>. And Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson\u2019s <em>Constellations</em>.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a favourite literary hero</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Isabel Archer from <em>Portrait of a Lady</em>; she would be up there with Madame Bovary. I also really, really love Fanny Price from <em>Mansfield Park</em>. She enters that household utterly displaced. Then we see how she creates a space of her own. For anyone who has left their own country and gone to live in a new one, for anyone who has moved to a new school and had to walk into a classroom knowing no one, Fanny Price is a patron saint.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t do thrillers and I can\u2019t do spy novels. I can\u2019t do any genre-fiction book, really</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?</strong><br>I didn\u2019t read until I was nine, so I didn\u2019t have any books by Enid Blyton or <em>Just William</em>. The first time I paid attention to a book and found it interesting was <em>The Four Fifty from Paddington</em> by Agatha Christie. It\u2019s about choking somebody on a train and I thought it was tremendously good. I also think it\u2019s the most marvellous title of any novel in English \u2013 it couldn\u2019t be better. The other author I loved at around 11 was Jean Plaidy, who wrote marvellous novels about the Tudors.

      "bodyText": "Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn is an award-winning Irish writer of fiction, nonfiction and poetry. He is also a professor of the humanities at Columbia University, New York. He was born in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford, the setting for several of his books, and educated at University College Dublin. His novels include The Master, Nora Webster and The House of Names. The film adaptation of Brooklyn, about a young Irish emigrant to New York, earned three Oscar nominations in 2015. His latest book, Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know: The Fathers of Wilde, Yeats and Joyce, is published by Penguin this week. When did you get the idea to write a book about the fathers of Joyce, Yeats and Wilde? It began with an invite from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, to give the 2017 Ellmann lectures, which are in honour of Richard Ellmann, the great American critic and biographer of Joyce, Yeats and Wilde. I started to think about all three writers and because I had loved that book of Yeats\u2019s father\u2019s letters [Letters to His Son WB Yeats and Others, 1869-1922 by John Butler Yeats]. I started to think of them in relation to their fathers and decided that would be my subject. By the time I had written the lectures, I found myself having nearly written a book. Fathers and mothers are often at the heart of your work... I am interested in families and what family does. It\u2019s not as though I make a deliberate decision to write about it, it just comes up in book after book. Even in the novel I am writing, it\u2019s just coming in again. Is there a connection with the death of your father when you were 13? I think it\u2019s about not having had those arguments that anybody of my generation in Ireland would have had with their father about nationalism, about Catholicism. I suppose that was something I missed, and I\u2019m always exploring what it would have been like. What is your take on the new wave of Irish novelists such as Sally Rooney, Anna Burns and Eimear McBride? I think they come straight out of Irish modernism. With Eimear McBride, you can see how much she\u2019s taken from Joyce and how much nourishment Joyce can still offer a writer. If you look at Sally Rooney, Anna Burns, Kevin Barry and Mike McCormack, there is an extraordinary struggle with form and language and it is a sort of miracle that this has come around again. It seems to be continuing even in nonfiction with writers such as Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson in her extraordinary collection of essays, Constellations. You could attribute this to various things, but I suspect the explanation is more personal than political or national. You can\u2019t rationalise it; it\u2019s mysterious and fascinating, rather than being the direct result of a set of political events. You spend much of your time now in the US. If you could require Donald Trump to read one book, what would it be? I think Trump is beyond that. You could have a lot of fun thinking of books for Clinton and Obama, but you can\u2019t really do it with Trump. It\u2019s not as though he could be improved in any way. No, I would suggest to him to leave books alone now. Which books are on your bedside table? Asghar and Zahra by Sameer Rahim \u2013 it\u2019s a novel set in London about one of those tight-knit, African Muslim communities. Because I liked Home Fire by Kamila Shamsie, I am totally interested in the idea of somebody actually writing about what\u2019s going on in England now in relation to outsiders. There is also Joseph O\u2019Connor\u2019s Shadow Play, which is a seriously fascinating story of Bram Stoker leaving Ireland, going to work with Henry Irving and creating Dracula. And Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson\u2019s Constellations. Do you have a favourite literary hero? Isabel Archer from Portrait of a Lady; she would be up there with Madame Bovary. I also really, really love Fanny Price from Mansfield Park. She enters that household utterly displaced. Then we see how she creates a space of her own. For anyone who has left their own country and gone to live in a new one, for anyone who has moved to a new school and had to walk into a classroom knowing no one, Fanny Price is a patron saint. What kind of reader were you as a child? I didn\u2019t read until I was nine, so I didn\u2019t have any books by Enid Blyton or Just William. The first time I paid attention to a book and found it interesting was The Four Fifty from Paddington by Agatha Christie. It\u2019s about choking somebody on a train and I thought it was tremendously good. I also think it\u2019s the most marvellous title of any novel in English \u2013 it couldn\u2019t be better. The other author I loved at around 11 was Jean Plaidy, who wrote marvellous novels about the Tudors. I remember The Captive Queen of Scots, about Mary Queen of Scots, which was very, very dramatic. People might be surprised to see Agatha Christie on your bookshelf. Are there any other books we might not expect to see there? No, I\u2019m really, really predictable. The only thing I suppose is that I probably have more poetry than I do prose. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve been reading poetry to try and figure out what\u2019s been going on in the world. Does poetry help with that? I find it does.

I think there\u2019s been some great poetry. Which books do you feel are most overrated? I can\u2019t do thrillers and I can\u2019t do spy novels. I can\u2019t do any genre-fiction books, really, none of them. I just get bored with the prose. I don\u2019t find any rhythm in it. It\u2019s blank, it\u2019s nothing; it\u2019s like watching TV.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United have rejected a \u00a354m bid from Internazionale for Romelu Lukaku and informed the Italian club it will need a significantly higher offer to succeed in luring the player away from Old Trafford. Lukaku missed the pre-season friendly between the two clubs in Singapore on Saturday, after complaining of an ankle injury and was seen talking to Inter officials on the pitch after a 1-0 victory for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team, courtesy of a second-half winner from Mason Greenwood. Inter are now contemplating lodging another offer and Antonio Conte, who confirmed his interest in the player on Friday, made it clear again after the match that he was still keen to take the Belgian striker to Serie A. \u201cI think that I have answered yesterday about Lukaku,\u201d the Inter head coach said. \u201cI think that it\u2019s not right to speak about the player that in this moment is a United player. For this reason I think we must show great respect for the club and at the same time also for the player and also for my players. \u201cAs I said yesterday, Lukaku is a player I like. I like him because I consider him a player that could improve our team. In one side there is my hope, my will. In the other side we\u2019ll see what we find with the club.\u201d Two years since moving to Old Trafford Lukaku is keen for the transfer to happen but United rejected the bid out of hand because it fell considerably short of their valuation for the former Everton player. Asked about Inter\u2019s bid \u2013 and United\u2019s ongoing interest in the Leicester defender Harry Maguire \u2013 Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cOf course you want to have your team settled as early as possible. Whoever\u2019s available, we work with them .... and let\u2019s see on August 8 or 9 who\u2019s here and who\u2019s not.\u201d Lukaku has yet to feature for United in pre-season and that appears to be frustrating his manager. \u201cIf you\u2019re a player and you don\u2019t manage to train for a week \u2013 and he\u2019s missed three games now \u2013 of course I think he\u2019ll be concerned,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe\u2019s working to get back on the pitch and let\u2019s see how long that takes.\u201d Of Greenwood\u2019s performance, Solskj\u00e6r added: \u201cThe kid\u2019s only 17 and he\u2019s learning every day training with these boys. He reminds me a little bit about the Giggsy [Ryan Giggs] story, that you can\u2019t really send him on loan. For me he\u2019s ready to be in this squad.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r was less impressed that Ashley Young was booed and jeered by United\u2019s fans during the match. \u201cI think Ashley is a top professional,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe always gives absolutely everything and his delivery ended up with a goal. Of course, we want fans to support our players. Ash has been a very loyal servant to this club for many, many years and he\u2019ll keep on performing when he plays. We\u2019ll have a chat with him but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get affected.\u201d",

Put Brexit in the bin, set the bin alight!\u201d Remain-campaigner Femi Oluwole also made an appearance. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t studied EU law, if I\u2019d grown up in one of those towns that politics have forgotten, if the only person who told me to vote remain had been David bloody Cameron, I\u2019d have voted leave, and I wouldn\u2019t have done it out of racism or stupidity, I\u2019d have done it because I needed change,\u201d Oluwole said. \u201cWe will get rid of first past the post so that votes actually count,\u201d he said, to loud applause, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s make the UK great, full stop.\u201d The biggest cheers were earned by activist and whistleblower Shahmir Sanni with his speech, in which he blasted the Brexit referendum as a \u201cperversion of democracy\u201d and described Boris Johnson as \u201cinherently oppressive\u201d. \u201cHe lied to the public, he lied to us all,\u201d Sanni said, adding that the British had been suffering at the hands of \u201ca corrupt political class\u201d, \u201ccoordinated misinformation campaigns run by lobby groups\u201d, and \u201cmillionaire donors\u201d, who had incited a race war and spread fear. The Liberal Democrat leadership hopeful Ed Davey was among those attending, alongside new Lib Dem recruit Chuka Umunna. Before the march, a Boris Johnson toddler blimp, wearing mismatched running gear and a Brexit-bus T-shirt, was launched in Parliament Square. The singer Billy Bragg and presenter Sandi Toksvig were also at the protest, with Bragg performing on stage at Parliament Square. Speaking before the march, Toksvig said she was taking part because she believed \u201cpassionately\u201d in the European project. \u201cSome of the enormous political issues we face today \u2013 the climate emergency, cybercrime, violence against women and girls \u2013 are truly global; we cannot fight them alone, and we cannot fight them outside of Europe.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/travel\" title=\"\">British holiday getaway</a> is usually the most anticipated weekend of the year, a culmination of months of fretting and planning. But this is the year of the last-minute summer.</p> <p>Huge numbers of people have delayed making bookings thanks to a messy cocktail of weather, politics and a plunging pound. Travel agents, tour operators, hotels and B&amp;Bs all say they have been battling Brexit uncertainty to get people to make bookings for months.</p> <p>Yet in the last few weeks, the yen for travel appears to have returned. More than 8,800 planes took off on Friday \u2013 the final tally will probably break records, according to the National Air Traffic Control Service \u2013 with two million travellers due to fly out of the UK over the weekend, said travel agents\u2019 association Abta.</p> <p>Those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/uk\" title=\"\">staying in the UK</a> are also heading off, making 13.4m car journeys throughout the weekend \u2013 4m more than this time last year \u2013 although there were the usual problems: a crash on the M5 led to 70 miles of tailbacks in Devon and Somerset.</p> <p>David Hope of GfK, <a href=\"https://www.gfk.com/insights/press-release/strong-late-sales-for-summer-2019-see-cumulative-travel-bookings-return-to-growth/\" title=\"\">a market research firm</a> which monitors package holiday sales, said travel companies had been discounting fiercely to overcome political problems. \u201cIt\u2019s been massively impacted by Brexit,\u201d he said, pinpointing the moment when people were put off booking holidays as 16 December 2018 \u2013 the date when a cabinet discussion about post-Brexit travel arrangements was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-deal-brexit-travel-warning-dont-go-on-holiday-after-march-29-jnfmrgsj9\" title=\"\">leaked to a newspaper</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt was saying basically \u2018after Brexit don\u2019t travel\u2019. Before that, at the end of November, bookings were 10% up. After the leak, bookings immediately dropped by 18% and they have struggled ever since, until the government changed the Brexit date to 31 October. It could be coincidental, but it mirrors exactly when the leak happened. We\u2019re now seeing bookings 1% ahead of summer 2018.\u201d</p> <p>The good news for travel companies may not last if planned strikes at several airports go ahead. Easyjet baggage handlers at Stansted and about 4,000 staff at Heathrow are due to walk out for two days if the pay disputes between employers and the Unite trade union are not resolved, with further two-day strikes planned. Talks continue at conciliation service Acas. Workers at Gatwick and British Airways pilots are also holding strike ballots.</p> <p>The fall in the value of the pound is also prompting more people to search for all-inclusive holidays, according to Travel Supermarket\u2019s Emma Coulthurst. \u201cThe storm of Brexit and its impact on currency exchange rates has seen many delay booking and prices come down as a result of the drop in demand,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many family holidays available from as little as \u00a3300 per person or less for a family of four this summer school holiday. That\u2019s unheard of.\u201d</p> <p>Spain \u2013 particularly Tenerife and Mallorca \u2013 remain the most popular places to go, but Coulthurst reported a surge in interest in Turkey, especially the southern coastline near Antalya.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c2a558ebc82e74d4100fd424a1ab9932296a2c5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a558ebc82e74d4100fd424a1ab9932296a2c5f/1002_0_2339_2922/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tourist boat in the Mediterranean\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tourist boat in the Mediterranean, west of popular holiday destination Antalya, Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burhan \u00d6zbilici/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest gainer is Tunisia, whose tourism industry collapsed after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/28/sousse-inquest-likely-to-reinforce-uk-travel-advice-on-tunisia\" title=\"\">terror attacks in 2015</a>. UK nationals made 155,000 trips to Tunisia in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, but this year should see levels similar to 2015\u2019s 411,000 visitors.</p> <p>Sardinia, the Costa Dorada near Barcelona, and Bulgaria are also all up, Coulthurst said, at the expense of Orlando, Dubrovnik and Dubai.A According to Brett Gerrett of Sunvil, an independent travel agent in southwest London. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen fares in this position in the last six years. They started low, went high, and came back down again. It\u2019s been a very strange year.\u201dGerrett was at Heathrow early on Friday in an effort to beat the crowds. \u201cWe\u2019re on the tarmac at the moment. I\u2019m on a BA flight going to Madrid and I\u2019ve paid \u00a3119 for a club seat - and it\u2019s the second day of the summer holidays.

      "bodyText": "The great British holiday getaway is usually the most anticipated weekend of the year, a culmination of months of fretting and planning. But this is the year of the last-minute summer. Huge numbers of people have delayed making bookings thanks to a messy cocktail of weather, politics and a plunging pound. Travel agents, tour operators, hotels and B&amp;Bs all say they have been battling Brexit uncertainty to get people to make bookings for months. Yet in the last few weeks, the yen for travel appears to have returned. More than 8,800 planes took off on Friday \u2013 the final tally will probably break records, according to the National Air Traffic Control Service \u2013 with two million travellers due to fly out of the UK over the weekend, said travel agents\u2019 association Abta. Those staying in the UK are also heading off, making 13.4m car journeys throughout the weekend \u2013 4m more than this time last year \u2013 although there were the usual problems: a crash on the M5 led to 70 miles of tailbacks in Devon and Somerset. David Hope of GfK, a market research firm which monitors package holiday sales, said travel companies had been discounting fiercely to overcome political problems. \u201cIt\u2019s been massively impacted by Brexit,\u201d he said, pinpointing the moment when people were put off booking holidays as 16 December 2018 \u2013 the date when a cabinet discussion about post-Brexit travel arrangements was leaked to a newspaper. \u201cIt was saying basically \u2018after Brexit don\u2019t travel\u2019. Before that, at the end of November, bookings were 10% up. After the leak, bookings immediately dropped by 18% and they have struggled ever since, until the government changed the Brexit date to 31 October. It could be coincidental, but it mirrors exactly when the leak happened. We\u2019re now seeing bookings 1% ahead of summer 2018.\u201d The good news for travel companies may not last if planned strikes at several airports go ahead. Easyjet baggage handlers at Stansted and about 4,000 staff at Heathrow are due to walk out for two days if the pay disputes between employers and the Unite trade union are not resolved, with further two-day strikes planned. Talks continue at conciliation service Acas. Workers at Gatwick and British Airways pilots are also holding strike ballots. The fall in the value of the pound is also prompting more people to search for all-inclusive holidays, according to Travel Supermarket\u2019s Emma Coulthurst. \u201cThe storm of Brexit and its impact on currency exchange rates has seen many delay booking and prices come down as a result of the drop in demand,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many family holidays available from as little as \u00a3300 per person or less for a family of four this summer school holiday. That\u2019s unheard of.\u201d Spain \u2013 particularly Tenerife and Mallorca \u2013 remain the most popular places to go, but Coulthurst reported a surge in interest in Turkey, especially the southern coastline near Antalya. The biggest gainer is Tunisia, whose tourism industry collapsed after the terror attacks in 2015. UK nationals made 155,000 trips to Tunisia in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, but this year should see levels similar to 2015\u2019s 411,000 visitors. Sardinia, the Costa Dorada near Barcelona, and Bulgaria are also all up, Coulthurst said, at the expense of Orlando, Dubrovnik and Dubai.A According to Brett Gerrett of Sunvil, an independent travel agent in southwest London. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen fares in this position in the last six years. They started low, went high, and came back down again. It\u2019s been a very strange year.\u201dGerrett was at Heathrow early on Friday in an effort to beat the crowds. \u201cWe\u2019re on the tarmac at the moment. I\u2019m on a BA flight going to Madrid and I\u2019ve paid \u00a3119 for a club seat - and it\u2019s the second day of the summer holidays. We\u2019ve had people coming in, not complaining exactly, but making a point to us that they paid high prices in advance and now it\u2019s lower. Nobody ever does that.\u201dTravellers with more money to spend were also leaving things late. Pete Brudenell, of luxury villa firm, CV Villas, said June bookings were up by more than half, particularly for Portugal and Turkey. Staycationers in the UK banking on a reprisal of last year\u2019s long hot summer will be pleased to see temperatures hit 30C in parts of England this week.But owners of B&amp;Bs and self-catering accommodation have also been hit by the last-minute summer. \u201cWe\u2019re getting shorter stays and later bookings,\u201d said Ali Kayley, who runs a glamping and holiday cottage business at Westley Farm in the Cotswolds. \u201cPeople are booking in the same week, and that wasn\u2019t happening a year ago.\u201d She said there had been a marked decline in the number of European visitors: \u201cWe get lots of German and Dutch families and our numbers are considerably down this year.\u201d Some European guests were put off by fears they would need a visa to get into the UK: \u201cOne of our regular guests from Holland was due to come in April, and he wanted a guarantee that he would get his money back.\u201d Joss Croft, the chief executive of trade body UKinbound, said hotels and operators serving American and Chinese visitors were doing well. \u201cBut 15% of my members are seeing a decrease in Germany and France, and Europeans make up 60% of our inbound visitors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a bigger concern is where on earth they\u2019re going to get the staff from \u2013 a lot of EU people have left, French speakers, Spanish speakers.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. More fun to come tomorrow, from Limoux and Fois Prat d\u2019Albis, with three category one climbs along the way. Bye for now! Laurens De Plus speaks for a very happy Jumbo-Visma: It\u2019s crazy. Even if we don\u2019t have the yellow jersey it\u2019s like we\u2019re living the yellow dream this year. Also for our team it\u2019s a surprise that we are so strong. I said it already a few times, I think it\u2019s a unique chance for Steven Kruijswijk to get on the podium of even more. I hope he can stay on his level like this and maybe wonderful things will happen. Geraint Thomas has had a chat. He says he felt \u201cquite weak\u201d from the start: I just didn\u2019t feel quite on it from the start. Just quite weak. At the end I knew I had to try to pace it. I didn\u2019t really attempt to follow them when they kicked. I felt it was better to ride my own pace and limit my losses that way, rather than trying to stay with them and blow up at the end. It was a tough day out there. I\u2019m just a bit disappointed, but it is what it is. I just tried to limit the damage. Still a lot to come, and hopefully I\u2019ll feel a bit better tomorrow. Here\u2019s a report on today\u2019s stage, which ended with France celebrating both a stage winner and a yellow jersey wearer. Thibaut Pinot is on the podium, collecting a bouquet, waving it about and looking a bit chuffed. Julian Alaphilippe had never finished in the top 40 of a mountain stage before *. Today, powered somehow by the yellow jersey, he came second. Nobody is taking him lightly now. * Actually he had. Sorry. Misinformed. And here\u2019s today\u2019s top 10: All change in the GC: Called it: Nairo Quintana completes the stage, 3min 23sec behind Pinot. Geraint Thomas crosses the line, about 35sec behind the yellow jersey! A brilliant win for Thibaut Pinot, and Alaphilippe comes second! 130m to go: Pinot goes, and can anyone catch him? 400m to go: The stage winner will surely come from this group: Alaphilippe, Kruijswik, Bernal, Buchmann, Pinot and Landa. 1km to go: Geraint Thomas is left behind! Six riders are at the head of the race, with Alaphilippe among them. 1.2km to go: Jakob Fuglsang has also been dropped. Alaphilippe is still looking comfortable. 1.5km to go: Thomas has dropped back since last I mentioned him, with Alaphilippe right behind him once again. 2km to go: The camera cuts to Quintana, entirely on his own, nobody anywhere near him, slogging up the hill. 3km to go: Gaudu is dragged back innto the pack, and three Jumbo-Visma riders are at the front now. Steven Kruijswijk is perfectly placed. 4km to go: David Gaudu attacks! Where has that come from? He doesn\u2019t get very far, mind. 4.5km to go: Geraint Thomas movess up to fifth, and Alaphilippe, who had been marking him, doesn\u2019t immediately respond. He\u2019s still clinging on to the leading group, with one rider behind him. 5km to go: Barguil has been caught, and this is anyone\u2019s day. 5.5km to go: Richie Porte, 15th in the GC this morning, has also been dropped, we\u2019re told. 6km to go: So it looks like the ambitions of Nairo Quintana, Adam Yates and Dan Martin, ninth, 10th and 11th in the GC rankings this morning, to win this race will end today. 6.3km to go: Julian Alaphilippe still seems entirely comfortable. He moves up the peloton to sit on the wheel of Geraint Thomas. 7km to go: David Gaudu tries to lead Thibaut Pinot away from the peloton, but they\u2019re not allowed to break free. 8.3km to go: Barguil still leads, but by just 11 seconds. \u201cThey say every sports ground has its own sound. The Lord\u2019s murmur and so on. But nothing is quite like the sound of the Tour,\u201d writes Sandy Balfour. \u201cI\u2019m about 6km from the summit, so the Peloton is what, 20 minutes away? 30? It doesn\u2019t matter. Around me people are bickering, laughing, joking in maybe 10 or 12 languages. And every now and then someone reads something in their phone or hears something and suddenly a hush of anticipation descends. People crane their necks. A couple shove to the front. But there is nothing to see and soon they are back to talking about other things. For riders it\u2019s all about the end. For spectators it\u2019s all in the anticipation. Because let\u2019s face it, for 99.9% of the day there is nothing to see. But we wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d 9.3km to go: Gesbert is hauled in, and Warren Barguil attacks! 9.5km to go: A couple of Movistar riders have been sent back to rescue Quintana. 10km to go: Movistar presumably haven\u2019t been pulling the peloton all day for Nairo Quintana: he has now been dropped. On Colombian Independence Day, he\u2019s on his own. 10.5km to go: Andrey Amador, who seems to have been at the head of the peloton for about half the stage, finally drops off the pace. An immense effort from the Costa Rican today. 12km to go: Dan Martin, 11th in the GC this morning, is falling away as well. Adam Yates, coincidentally, was 10th. 12.5km to go: Patrick Konrad had to change bikes and thus finds himself behind the yellow jersey group, stuck with Adam Yates and his mates. 13km to go: Gesbert is now on his own, 30 seconds ahead of the yellow jersey group, which is still being led by Movistar, with a gaggle of Ineos riders tucked in behind. 14km to go: Adam Yates is having a very bad day, and is struggling again with a lot of climbing still to come. 15km to go: Elie Gesbert has joined Romain Sicard at the front, 45 seconds ahead of anyone else. 17km to go: The first couple of dozen mentions of Tourmalet in the Guardian all concerned a horse of that name, which apparently did quite a lot of winning in the 1860s. The first mention in a cycling context was in a report on the 1924 race: \u201c...Then come, in the Basque country,, the Justices of the Peace, those calm, inhuman shoulders of the great Pyrenean range; Aubisque, Tourmalet, Aspin, which no car can climb without resting to cool, which separate and inexorably classify the racers ... the hardest test humanity has invented for the ultimate strength of legs.\u201d 19km to go: Sicard goes through Esqui\u00e8ze-S\u00e8re, and from here there is nowhere to go but up. 20km to go: Whooosh! Sicard is now 1.30sec ahead of the peloton. Gesbert and Calmejane are about 30sec closer. 25km to go: We have a new leader: Romain Sicard has gone on his own! 27km to go: All but two of the Movistar team are in the peloton, helping Nairo Quintana as best they can. 30km to go: The route almost immediately heads uphill, gently at first, towards the Tourmalet. \u201cJust saw a gendarme herding cows to keep them off the road,\u201d writes Gareth Thomas (a while ago, back when there were cows milling about). \u201cWhy don\u2019t farmers herd their own cows to keep them safe if they know the TDF is coming through? Happens every year.\u201d They presumably think that if the Tour didn\u2019t want to run the risk of rider-bovine interactions they would make sure the route didn\u2019t go anywhere near their cows. 31km to go: Wellens is first to finish the sprint, with the front three about to be caught by a chasing five. 33km to go: Sagan might have dropped out of the breakaway but he\u2019s still got some fuel in the tank, and he\u2019s been leading the yellow jersey group as they haul in the remainers. They\u2019re now just 45sec behind the leading trio. 34km to go: There is an intermediate sprint to Pierrefitte-Nestalas, with the finish line just a couple of kilometres away now. 35km to go: Adam Yates, thanks in no small part to his brother Simon, has been dragged back into the yellow jersey group. 38km to go: The leaders pass Argel\u00e8s-Gazost, home of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Animal Park, apparently very much the place to go if you want to feed a marmot. 42km to go: Of that 17-strong breakaway group, only eight remain. The front three (Nibali, Wellens and Gesbert) have a 30-second lead over the other five, with the peloton 1min 15sec back. 47km to go: The leaders pass through Aucun. Which, if I\u2019m not mistaken, is a town called None. 49km to go: The riders descend at wild pace. Here is the confirmed points distribution from that category four climb: 52km to go: The next 25km or so are mainly descent, before the big stage-concluding climb. 55km to go: I haven\u2019t really mentioned Julian Alaphilippe, but he\u2019s looking fairly comfortable in the peloton. 56km to go: Nibali tries to stick with Wellens, and fails. Another 10 points for the polka-dot jersey wearer. 56.5km to go: It\u2019s Wellens and Nibali, side by side with 400m to go. 57km to go: The leaders are just 1km from the top of the climb, but behind them the peloton, still being dragged uphill by Movistar, is on the hunt. They are just 1min 23sec behind now. 58km to go: There are a lot of cows grazing on the edge of the road. One of them has to be shepherded away by spectators to prevent a potentially horrific if milky pile-up. 58km to go: Three go alone at the front, looking for the points at the top of the climb. Nibali, Wellens and Gesbert are the leading trio. 59km to go: 2.5km of climbing still ahead of the leaders. Adam Yates is also now struggling. 60km to go: Meanwhile at the back of the race, Romain Bardet has been dropped by the peloton. 60km to go: The leading group has fractured, with eight riders now at the front. Nibali and Gesbert are both there, along with Zakarin, Sanchez, Sicard, Kamna, Wellens and Carlos Verona. 61km to go: This is intriguing now. The peloton is strung out, with a couple of Movistar riders at the front, dragging it uphill. The leaders are 5km from the top. 63km to go: Guillaume Martin, not exactly a shoddy climber, is also falling behind the leading group. Its leaders are going at quite the pace, intent of protecting their advantage over the peloton. 64km to go: A few riders are struggling on the climb. Rein Taaram\u00e4e is one of them - he has fallen off the back of the leading group, and is not going to catch up any time soon. 66km to go: The peloton have hauled back a bit of the gap to the leading group, which now stands at 2min 26sec. The leaders reach Arb\u00e9ost, whose only mention in the Guardian came when Nicci Gerrard stopped there on a walking holiday in 1997. She described it as a \u201ctiny hamlet\u201d where \u201capparently only 15 people live\u201d which \u201cstands on the slopes of a wild and little-known valley\u201d. She had a lovely dinner of duck soup, followed by duck. 69km to go: The leaders reach Ferri\u00e8res. Like Leeds in England, Ferri\u00e8res has a castle that\u2019s nowhere near it: the Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res is near Paris. 72km to go: The delayed start was down to some environmental protesters who expressed their unhappiness at industrial emissions by sitting in the middle of the road, forcing organisers to give police time to clear them. 76km to go: There are 17 riders in the breakaway group, with a lead of nearly three minutes on the peloton. Here\u2019s a handy list: 77km to go: We are well into the foothills of the Col du Soulor, though the leaders are still 20km from the summit. 80km to go: So to Arthez-d\u2019Asson, another town with just one mention in the Guardian archives. In 1933 we mentioned in our obituary of Henri Bremond, the noted French priest and historian, that he had died there. Emmanuel Macron is, well, somewhere on route. He\u2019s waving at people and shaking some hands, with a burly man in sunglasses looking stressed behind him. 86km to go: The 15 chasers have caught the leading duo, and have a 2min 37sec lead over the peloton. Meanwhile Kate Nikki wants me to give a shout out to The InternationElles and Donnons des Elles au V\u00e9lo J-1, \u201ctwo teams of female cyclists riding the entire tour route a day ahead of the men to highlight the lack of a proper stage race for women. None of the road closures or support networks of course. They made it safely up Tourmalet yesterday, and after a transfer and very short night are on stage 15, with plenty more climbing.\u201d 91km to go: The leaders pass through Coarraze. The town has been mentioned in the Guardian precisely once in all of history, when we reported in 1842 on the erection of a statue of Henry IV of France in Pau. On one side of the pedestal is \u201ca bas-relief, from the chisel of M Etex, representing the great king playing with the little mountaineers of Coarraze\u201d. 93km to go: The breakaway has been allowed to definitively break, with Guillaume Martin the best-placed member in GC terms, sitting in 25th place this morning. 96km to go: The leaders reach B\u00e9n\u00e9jacq, which strikes me as a rather lovely name for a rather obscure little village. Here\u2019s their rugby team: 98km to go: Sagan and Nibali have crested that climb, and are having a little chat as they coast downhill for a bit. 100km to go: The leaders are on their way up the Cote de Labatmale, the first categorised climb of the day. There is now a 15-strong chasing group, with the front two now 1min 30sec ahead of the peloton. 102km to go: Lennard K\u00e4mna tries to close the gap, but it\u2019s still growing. Tim Wellens is just behind him. 103km to go: Now the front two lead by 26 seconds, and the gap is increasing quickly. 105km to go: Sagan and Nibali have extended their lead to about eight seconds, a decent distance when they\u2019re on their way back downhill at nearly 80kmh. 107km to go: Nibali and Elie Gesbert take a small lead but are hauled back in, then Nibali goes again, this time with Peter Sagan. 108km to go: They\u2019re on a gentle climb already, which is stretching the peloton, and Vincenzo Nibali has taken an early lead at the front. And they\u2019re off! The race director waves his flag and accelerates away! They have now passed the protest, which thanks to some skilful editing on the part of the broadcasters has received absolutely no international publicity. Apparently there is a demonstration at Ossun, four kilometres into the stage, so the riders will be chaperoned through that before the racing gets under way. Due to as-yet unknown \u201ctechnical issues\u201d the start has been slightly shifted, so there will be less than 117.5km of actual racing. The general classification looks something like this: The rollout is about to start rolling. The Pyrenees are looking gorgeous this afternoon, which is just as well given the number of lingering helicopter shots we\u2019re going to be treated to before the day\u2019s out. So, stage 14. Tarbes to Col du Tourmalet, and the first classic climb of this year\u2019s Tour. Just the 117.5km, but they\u2019re hard yards: the category four climb to Cote de Labatmale, the category one Col du Soulor, and the hors-categorie, 19km-long final climb, with a steepest climb of 13.5%, are all on the route. It all looks something like this: Here\u2019s our report on yesterday\u2019s Stage 13. And welcome! It should be an excellent day\u2019s cycling.",

A wonderful turnover, nabbing the ball away from Folau. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1713881ddb35f538de330cb889caea00c03a9fc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1713881ddb35f538de330cb889caea00c03a9fc2/0_0_3500_2542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Eboni Usoro-Brown in action with New Zealand\u2019s Maria Folau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Eboni Usoro-Brown in action with New Zealand\u2019s Maria Folau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T15:03:48.359Z\">at 4.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3326238f0845f89e311022\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T14:33:22.234Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Q2 14 mins:</strong> They\u2019re level-pegging! 21-21!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3325df8f0845f89e311020\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T14:32:58.372Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Q2 14 mins</strong>: Harten turns up the volume.

England are an hour away from another World Cup final and, almost a week on from Jofra Archer\u2019s heroics at Lord\u2019s, Tracey Neville\u2019s netball side are within touching distance of reaching their first final. New Zealand, who won this competition in 2003 and have lost out to Australia in the past three finals, stand in the way of an England team that are yet to taste defeat in this tournament, and there is no getting away from the reality that this is their toughest test yet. England won Commonwealth Games gold four years ago but making it past the final hurdle at a World Cup would represent new territory. Neville witnessed her side finish with a bang in the group stage and is determined to help England to the final in front of a sell-out, vuvuzela-wielding home crowd. \u201cWe have 10,000 people in the stadium and they are absolutely amazing,\u201d said Neville, who will step down as head coach at the end of the tournament. \u201cAt first it was a bit intimidating \u2013 I wasn\u2019t expecting them to come and make so much noise, but it\u2019s come to be something of our eighth player.\u201d<br><br><strong>Centre pass:</strong> 3pm (BST)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/19/england-familiar-foe-netball-world-cup-semi-final\">England face familiar foe New Zealand in netball World Cup semi-final | Emma John</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T12:56:50.905Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

We knew they [New Zealand] were going to come out hard \u2013 we would have had liked to make a better start \u2013 but we came back into it well. Unfortunately, today New Zealand were the better team.\u201d She continues: \u201cI just want to thank everyone who has been on this journey and there is still a medal up for grabs.

A brilliant advert for the sport, and yet more end-to-end drama in Liverpool. Q4 14 min: NZ lead 46-44! And they are eating down the clock. Q4 13 min: New Zealand lead 45-43! One hundred-odd seconds to play! Q4 12 min: And then Helen Housby goes one better! England trail by just two goals now. They can\u2019t, can they? Tracey Neville\u2019s side are giving it helluva go ... Q4 12 min: Jo Harten strikes for England! NZ lead 44-41! Q4 11 min: New Zealand take the sting out of the England fightback, with Folau doing what she does best, looping in another cool finish. NZ reinstate a three-goal lead. For evidence of how unrelenting NZ have been, Ameliaranne Ekenasio just had to put a trainer back on, after it slipped off in the heat of battle. Can the Silver Ferns see it out, or will England come up with the goods late on? Q4 10 min: The England comeback. Is. On. New Zealand lead 42-40! Q4 8 min: New Zealand lead 42-38. A timely interception and Shannon Saunders does superbly to help the ball into the path of Folau. And, it goes without saying, but the Ferns\u2019 goal shooter buried the chance that followed. Q4 7 min: New Zealand edge into a 41-37 lead after Guthrie is cautioned for persistent obstruction. Things are beginning to slip away from England. Q4 6 min: New Zealand lead England 40-37. Q4 5 mins: Ten minutes of play left in this relentless final. \u201cAmazing that NZ shooter Ameliaranne Ekenasio has NOT missed,\u201d says Erin Delahunty. \u201cShe\u2019s one of two mothers on the court for the Ferns. The other is Casey Kopua.\u201d Q4 4 min: New Zealand lead 38-36! Guthrie is penalised for holding on to the ball for too long, exceeding the three-second limit. But Harten nicks the ball back from New Zealand, pumping her chest in celebration and Housby does the rest, looping home another priceless riposte. England trail by just the two, now. Q4 2 min: England trail 38-34! Harten has an off-moment and an unforgiving New Zealand side seize on a clumsy error. Folau with the merciless finish. Q4 1 min: England get off to a flyer, with Harten weighing in with another cool finish. Will New Zealand reach a sixth successive World Cup final, or can England navigate their way to a maiden appearance in the event\u2019s showpiece? A quick reminder the winner will face Australia in Sunday\u2019s final: New Zealand lead England 36-33. Helen Housby nets in the final seconds to tee up a riveting fourth and final decisive quarter. Q3 13 mins: New Zealand lead 35-31! Guthrie, the England captain, appears to be struggling. She has given absolutely everything here. \u201cAnother England-New Zealand World Cup knockout might be settled by a tie-breaker if the match continues being this close,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma. New Zealand have, however, made a few big strides in the last couple of minutes. Super over, anyone? Q3 12 mins: England trail 32-31! There is simply no let-up, no margin for error. Just as Housby senses blood, Ekenasio nudges New Zealand back in front. \u201cIt\u2019s so loud inside M&amp;S Arena the players are obviously struggling to hear the whistle,\u201d says Erin Delahunty. Remember, a full report from Liverpool will follow. Q3 10 mins: Inseparable. Twenty-nine apiece. This is nerve-wracking netball in all its glory. Goal attack Ameliaranne Ekenasio finds a timely equaliser for New Zealand after England regained a one-goal lead. Who can sneak in front with five minutes left of this quarter? We are in for a barnstorming finish. Q3 7 mins: 27-27 it is! A sumptuous leveller by Folau. \u201cLoving the updates Ben \u2013 no coverage in Cyprus!\u201d tweets Kate Jones. \u201cLet\u2019s go, third quarter is ours!\u201d Q3 6 mins: Harten dinks in another, moments after the substitute Shannon Saunders cancelled out her earlier effort. You could cut the tension with a knife. Q3 5 mins: New Zealand find an equaliser! It\u2019s 25-25 in Liverpool. The Silver Ferns have come flying out of the blocks, leading this quarter 4-1. But here come England on the counter ... Q3 4 min: Well, then. Folau is human after all, missing a simple chance with the net gaping. England patiently try to rebuild. They look to Harten and Housby, who inadvertently collide in attack. But New Zealand turnover and Ameliaranne Ekenasio coolly sinks a goal to close the gap. England lead 25-24. Q3 2 min: England lead 25-23. Goal shooter Maria Folau has been a prolific force for the Silver Ferns. She, effortlessly, loops a couple of early shots into the net, but Tracey Neville\u2019s side are quick to reply. A neck-and-neck start here. Q3 1 min: Laura Langman kickstarts the third quarter with the centre pass. Can they regain control of this one? England look thoroughly revved-up. Half-time emails. \u201cGo the Kiwis ... make up for the cricket,\u201d says Jo Davies. As for Tor Turner, he has helluva tale to tell. \u201cNot a big netball fan, but I did play at school in my youth, and I\u2019m enjoying watching the Roses come back into this game with some serious pace and aggression,\u201d Tor begins. \u201cBit of a shock to see my old school netball teacher, Kathleen Edwards (but always known as Miss Edwards to us), sat in behind Tracy Neville in the bench area. By all accounts she\u2019s a bit of a legend and did take our school netball team to nationals a number of times, so I shouldn\u2019t really be surprised she\u2019s still involved with the game. I do however have the honour of being the worst pupil she ever encountered in 30 years of teaching, in her own words, so fingers crossed she doesn\u2019t remember me at all!\u201d What will Tracey Neville\u2019s half-time team-talk consist of? More of the same, essentially. They finished the second quarter with some real gusto. No need for the Sir Alex Ferguson hairdryer treatment that her brothers, Gary and Philip, will have been on the receiving end of at Manchester United during their career. England lead 24-21! High-fives all round, as England not only rally back but superbly fight back from a six-goal deficit to turn an enthralling game on its head. New Zealand looked shellshocked at the tail-end of that quarter. England \u2013 at last \u2013 have managed to snuff out Folau, with Harten and Housby growing in influence, with Neville\u2019s decision to switch their positions seemingly a masterstroke. Unbelievable character by England to bounce back. Q2 14 mins: New Zealand trail 22-21! A frenetic finish to this second quarter in Liverpool, as England take the lead for the first time in this topsy-turvy match-up. Now, then, how will New Zealand respond? Their initial riposte is to up the ante but Eboni Usoro-Brown does superbly to steal the ball back. A wonderful turnover, nabbing the ball away from Folau. Q2 14 mins: They\u2019re level-pegging! 21-21! Q2 14 mins: Harten turns up the volume. England trail by just a single goal! New Zealand are being penned in. \u201cYep, a Kiwi on holiday in Bali here and no way to watch the games,\u201d emails Jo Davies. \u201cLoving your blog!\u201d Keep the emails coming. Q2 12 mins: NZ 20-17 England. What can Tracey Neville\u2019s side do to force their way back in? Harten and Housby \u2013 who have swapped positions, with the latter now in goal attack \u2013 eat away at the margin but England require more. Q2 10 mins: New Zealand have wrestled back control of this one, with Ekenasio and Folau threatening to run riot. They have managed to sap the life out of England, all of that early promise in this second quarter. Saying that, they have already hit back from one five-goal deficit here. Now it is time to go again. Q2 8 mins: New Zealand lead 18-13. \u201cKeep it up!\u201d emails Catherine Doran. \u201cI\u2019m on a plane headed to the UK and I\u2019m following along! Go Kiwis!\u201d Q2 6 mins: England trail 17-13! Coolness personified by Ameliaranne Ekenasio, who pokes New Zealand back in front. And then they go for the jugular, with Folau looping in another after England get sloppy in defence. Q2 4 mins: Housby draws England level. 13-13! Q2 3 mins: Harten sinks a couple of early replies, seconds after Housby hit the metalwork of the hoop. Harten attempts to gee up the home crowd, who duly respond by roaring the Roses on. But Folau gets New Zealand back on track in the only way she knows how, adding another goal for the Silver Ferns. Q2 1 min: New Zealand restart things with the centre pass. Laura Langman begins proceedings as the Silver Ferns seek to finish where they left off. \u201cLoving the blog (I played netball until I was 14),\u201d emails Joe from Kent. \u201cKeeping me updated from the beer garden. Fancy England to hit back before half-time but Maria Folau is causing lots of problems for our defence.\u201d New Zealand win the first battle of minds and bodies; they lead England 12-9 in Liverpool. Housby missed a golden opportunity on the brink of the interval, but Tracey Neville\u2019s side managed to fight their way back from 5-0 down. Q1 14 mins: New Zealand lead England 12-9. Q1 13 mins: Geva Mentor is penalised for obstruction and Maria Folau sinks the rebound. England are struggling to make the most of the centre pass, with New Zealand quick to suffocate any whiff of pressure. Nevertheless, Harten weighs in with another to make life interesting as the first quarter draws to a close. Q1 11 mins: New Zealand lead 9-7. England fail to make the most of wing defence Jade Clarke turning over in the final third. Housby continues to cause problems for the Silver Ferns, who otherwise remain fairly composed. Goal shooter Maria Folau sinks another for New Zealand, seizing on a Roses error. Q1 9 mins: Housby sinks another one, as England edge nearer to restoring parity. New Zealand are not having it all their own way now. Q1 8 mins: New Zealand lead England 6-5. Harten atones for her earlier misses, weighing in with another. \u201cThe umpire at England\u2019s shooting end is Australian Michelle Pippard, who sent off a Ugandan player in one of the first matches of the tournament,\u201d says Erin Delahunty, who is watching on in Liverpool. \u201cShe won\u2019t mess around with cautions if she feels they are warranted.\u201d Q1 7 mins: Housby and Harten add a quick-fire double, and England appear to have shaken off a few early nerves. Housby is beginning to run the show. Q1 5 mins: Jo Harten misses a couple of sitters but goal attack Helen Housby eventually gets England on the scoresheet. New Zealand, who are penalised for intimidation, gift Tracey Neville\u2019s side another chance and Harten takes it this time. It is New Zealand that firmly remain in the box seat. Q1 3 mins: New Zealand race into a 3-0 lead. Casey Kopua is bossing things in defence for the Silver Ferns. England are up against it early on. New Zealand get things started. Netball\u2019s coming home? One by one, the players strut out from the tunnel to considerable fanfare. The thudding backdrop? We Will Rock You, of course. Here we go, then ... Team T-Nev! The atmosphere in Liverpool is building, with less than 10 minutes until the first centre pass as England and New Zealand renew their rivalry in an enthralling semi-final. There is a sea of red and white, a mini-wall of St George\u2019s flags, and, oh, half a dozen Tracey Neville lookalikes donning blonde wigs. A quick Aussie perspective, courtesy of Erin Delahunty, who is in situ in Liverpool for the big one. \u201cThe reigning champions Australia have said they don\u2019t care who play in the final. But one thing is for sure, they will be hoping this will be a bruising encounter, so whoever makes the final has some sore bodies.\u201d Tracey Neville speaks pre-match, and discusses deciding to step away from her role as Roses head coach to start a family. Going out as a World Cup champion would not be a bad way to bow out, would it? \u201cI think my boss would be very upset if I walked away as early as Monday. I think I have a bit of time [before leaving], but it is time to take a break for my own personal well-being,\u201d says the 42-year-old. \u201cUnfortunately, I am the person in my relationship who has to make that sacrifice. I will always be a Rose with them.\u201d England: GS Jo Harten GA Helen Housby WA Chelsea Pitman C Serena Guthrie WD Jade Clarke GD Eboni Usoro-Brown GK Geva Mentor Subs: Rachel Dunn Natalie Haythornthwaite Natalie Panagarry Francesca Williams New Zealand: GS Maria Folau GA Ameliaranne Ekenasio WA Gina Crampton C Laura Langman WD Katrina Rore GD Casey Kopua GK Jane Watson Subs: Karin Burger Phoenix Karaka Bailey Mes Shannon Saunders Te Paea Selby-Rickit There is no hiding the expectation that surrounds the Roses. Put simply, the Commonwealth champions will need to be at their best to prevent New Zealand from joining Australia in the final. South Africa took the Aussies almightily close, forcing the favourites to dig deep and Tracey Neville\u2019s side will have to match that kind of lung-busting effort. And how about this for a heart-warming sporting detail: Kurtis Guthrie, the brother of the England captain, Serena, has been given the weekend off by League Two football club Stevenage to support his sister on Merseyside. The winner of this one will, of course, play Australia. The reigning champions rested a series of big names but still got the job done in Liverpool earlier. Courtney Bruce was crucial in defence as Australia eked into Sunday\u2019s final: We could get used to this. England are an hour away from another World Cup final and, almost a week on from Jofra Archer\u2019s heroics at Lord\u2019s, Tracey Neville\u2019s netball side are within touching distance of reaching their first final. New Zealand, who won this competition in 2003 and have lost out to Australia in the past three finals, stand in the way of an England team that are yet to taste defeat in this tournament, and there is no getting away from the reality that this is their toughest test yet. England won Commonwealth Games gold four years ago but making it past the final hurdle at a World Cup would represent new territory. Neville witnessed her side finish with a bang in the group stage and is determined to help England to the final in front of a sell-out, vuvuzela-wielding home crowd. \u201cWe have 10,000 people in the stadium and they are absolutely amazing,\u201d said Neville, who will step down as head coach at the end of the tournament. \u201cAt first it was a bit intimidating \u2013 I wasn\u2019t expecting them to come and make so much noise, but it\u2019s come to be something of our eighth player.\u201d Centre pass: 3pm (BST)",

And its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/this-death-star-presidency-is-no-ally-for-modern-britain\" title=\"\">relationship with Trump\u2019s America</a> is uniquely strained.</p> <p>Much of this angst could have been avoided. Britain opposed Trump\u2019s decision to quit the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, the trigger for today\u2019s crisis. It has watched with alarm as the Trump-Bolton policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d, involving punitive sanctions and an oil embargo, has radicalised the most moderate Iranians.</p> <p>Yet even as Britain backed EU attempts to rescue the nuclear deal, Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt, foreign secretary, tried to have it both ways \u2013 to keep Trump sweet. They publicly supported Washington\u2019s complaints about Iran\u2019s \u201cdestabilising\u201d regional activities and missile programme, and berated Iran when it bypassed agreed nuclear curbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902AmZi3WnV3Mdw/\" data-alt=\"Gulf map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/archive-zip/giv-3902AmZi3WnV3Mdw/\">Gulf map</a> </figure>  <p>Crucially, the government failed to significantly beef up protection for British-flagged vessels transiting the Gulf after attacks in May and June. This was partly because a depleted Royal Navy lacks capacity to mount adequate patrols. But it was also because officials feared that by raising its military profile, Britain could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/gulf-crisis-tanker-retaliation-iran-hormuz\" title=\"\">sucked into armed conflict</a> with Iran.</p> <p>For Bolton, however, drawing Britain unambiguously in on America\u2019s side was a desirable outcome. So when US spy satellites, tasked with helping block Iranian oil exports in line with Trump\u2019s global embargo, began to track Grace I on its way, allegedly, to Syria, Bolton saw an opportunity.</p> <p>The Spanish newspaper, <em>El Pais</em>, citing official sources, takes up the story: \u201cThe Grace 1, which flies a Panamanian flag, had been under surveillance by US satellites since April, when it was anchored off Iran. The supertanker, full to the brim with crude oil, was too big for the Suez Canal, and so it sailed around the Cape of Good Hope before heading for the Mediterranean.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to the US intelligence services, it was headed for the Syrian oil refinery of Banias. Washington advised Madrid of the arrival of the supertanker 48 hours ahead of time, and the Spanish navy <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/07/16/inenglish/1563261801_077325.html\" title=\"\">followed its passage</a> through the Strait of Gibraltar. It was expected to cross via international waters, as many Iranian vessels do without being stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Although Spanish officials, speaking after the event, said they would have intercepted the ship \u201cif we had had the information and the opportunity\u201d, Spain took no action at the time. But Bolton, in any case, was not relying on Madrid. The US had already tipped off Britain. On 4 July, after Grace I entered British-Gibraltar territorial waters, the fateful order was issued in London \u2013 it is not known by whom \u2013 and 30 marines stormed aboard.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s reaction was immediate and furious. It claimed Britain had acted illegally because the EU embargo on oil supplies to Syria, which Hunt claimed to be upholding, applied only to EU states and not to third countries such as Iran. In any case, Tehran said, the ship\u2019s destination was not Syria.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s outrage was shared, to a lesser degree, by Josep Borrell, Spain\u2019s socialist foreign minister. Borrell resented the British incursion into Gibraltar\u2019s territorial waters, which Madrid does not recognise. He also appears to have been annoyed that Spain was drawn in \u2013 in Tehran, the Spanish ambassador had been summonsed by the foreign ministry to explain Madrid\u2019s role. His reaction was to distance Spain from the affair. The Iranian tanker had been seized \u201cfollowing a request from the United States to the United Kingdom,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-iran-tanker-spain/tanker-detained-by-gibraltar-on-us-request-to-britain-spain-says-idUSKCN1TZ0ZT\" title=\"\">he said</a>. And even though Britain was supposedly upholding EU regulations, the External Action Service, the EU\u2019s foreign policy arm, has remained silent throughout.</p> <p>Iran\u2019s retaliation in snatching the Stena Impero has further exposed Britain\u2019s diplomatic isolation and its military and economic vulnerability. The government has advised British ships to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, an admission it cannot protect them. But between 15 and 30 British-flagged tankers transit the strait each day. If trade is halted, the impact on energy prices may be severe.</p> <p>Hunt\u2019s appeal for international support for Britain has so far fallen on deaf ears, France and Germany excepted. China, Japan and other countries that rely on oil from the Gulf show no sign of helping. The US plan for a multinational coalition to protect Gulf shipping has few takers. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s promise to back Britain has scant practical value \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/iran-on-dangerous-path-with-seizure-of-stena-impero-says-uk\" title=\"\">carries inherent dangers</a>.</p> <p>The Bolton gambit succeeded. Despite its misgivings, Britain has been co-opted on to the front line of Washington\u2019s confrontation with Iran. The process of polarisation, on both sides, is accelerating. The nuclear deal is closer to total collapse. And by threatening Iran with \u201cserious consequences\u201d, without knowing what that may entail, Britain blindly dances to the beat of Bolton\u2019s war drums.</p>",

Britain opposed Trump\u2019s decision to quit the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, the trigger for today\u2019s crisis. It has watched with alarm as the Trump-Bolton policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d, involving punitive sanctions and an oil embargo, has radicalised the most moderate Iranians. Yet even as Britain backed EU attempts to rescue the nuclear deal, Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt, foreign secretary, tried to have it both ways \u2013 to keep Trump sweet. They publicly supported Washington\u2019s complaints about Iran\u2019s \u201cdestabilising\u201d regional activities and missile programme, and berated Iran when it bypassed agreed nuclear curbs. Crucially, the government failed to significantly beef up protection for British-flagged vessels transiting the Gulf after attacks in May and June. This was partly because a depleted Royal Navy lacks capacity to mount adequate patrols. But it was also because officials feared that by raising its military profile, Britain could be sucked into armed conflict with Iran. For Bolton, however, drawing Britain unambiguously in on America\u2019s side was a desirable outcome. So when US spy satellites, tasked with helping block Iranian oil exports in line with Trump\u2019s global embargo, began to track Grace I on its way, allegedly, to Syria, Bolton saw an opportunity. The Spanish newspaper, El Pais, citing official sources, takes up the story: \u201cThe Grace 1, which flies a Panamanian flag, had been under surveillance by US satellites since April, when it was anchored off Iran. The supertanker, full to the brim with crude oil, was too big for the Suez Canal, and so it sailed around the Cape of Good Hope before heading for the Mediterranean. \u201cAccording to the US intelligence services, it was headed for the Syrian oil refinery of Banias. Washington advised Madrid of the arrival of the supertanker 48 hours ahead of time, and the Spanish navy followed its passage through the Strait of Gibraltar. It was expected to cross via international waters, as many Iranian vessels do without being stopped.\u201d Although Spanish officials, speaking after the event, said they would have intercepted the ship \u201cif we had had the information and the opportunity\u201d, Spain took no action at the time. But Bolton, in any case, was not relying on Madrid. The US had already tipped off Britain. On 4 July, after Grace I entered British-Gibraltar territorial waters, the fateful order was issued in London \u2013 it is not known by whom \u2013 and 30 marines stormed aboard. Iran\u2019s reaction was immediate and furious. It claimed Britain had acted illegally because the EU embargo on oil supplies to Syria, which Hunt claimed to be upholding, applied only to EU states and not to third countries such as Iran. In any case, Tehran said, the ship\u2019s destination was not Syria. Iran\u2019s outrage was shared, to a lesser degree, by Josep Borrell, Spain\u2019s socialist foreign minister. Borrell resented the British incursion into Gibraltar\u2019s territorial waters, which Madrid does not recognise. He also appears to have been annoyed that Spain was drawn in \u2013 in Tehran, the Spanish ambassador had been summonsed by the foreign ministry to explain Madrid\u2019s role. His reaction was to distance Spain from the affair. The Iranian tanker had been seized \u201cfollowing a request from the United States to the United Kingdom,\u201d he said. And even though Britain was supposedly upholding EU regulations, the External Action Service, the EU\u2019s foreign policy arm, has remained silent throughout. Iran\u2019s retaliation in snatching the Stena Impero has further exposed Britain\u2019s diplomatic isolation and its military and economic vulnerability. The government has advised British ships to avoid the Strait of Hormuz, an admission it cannot protect them. But between 15 and 30 British-flagged tankers transit the strait each day. If trade is halted, the impact on energy prices may be severe. Hunt\u2019s appeal for international support for Britain has so far fallen on deaf ears, France and Germany excepted. China, Japan and other countries that rely on oil from the Gulf show no sign of helping. The US plan for a multinational coalition to protect Gulf shipping has few takers. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s promise to back Britain has scant practical value \u2013 and carries inherent dangers. The Bolton gambit succeeded. Despite its misgivings, Britain has been co-opted on to the front line of Washington\u2019s confrontation with Iran. The process of polarisation, on both sides, is accelerating. The nuclear deal is closer to total collapse. And by threatening Iran with \u201cserious consequences\u201d, without knowing what that may entail, Britain blindly dances to the beat of Bolton\u2019s war drums.",

      "bodyText": "Call it karma. Less than a week after England stole a World Cup from under the careful moustaches of New Zealand\u2019s cricketers, the Silver Ferns took a measure of revenge for their menfolk. They beat the Roses by just two goals in a nerve shredder that denied Tracey Neville\u2019s women their first Netball World Cup final \u2013 and indeed, their best ever shot at the trophy. Neville blamed \u201cbasic errors\u201d for the 47-45 defeat and the captain, Serena Guthrie, denied the emotion of a home semi-final had got to the players. \u201cThat has nothing to do with our performance today,\u201d said Guthrie. \u201cWe had two teams going against each other with different tactics and we didn\u2019t execute well enough.\u201d But Guthrie conceded nearly three times as many penalties as the unflappable Laura Langman in the rival captains\u2019 battle at centre, and the goal shooter Jo Harten, who missed her first two shots of the game, said her team \u201cwavered at critical moments\u201d. \u201cTrying to control nerves, there\u2019s no scientific cure for that,\u201d said Harten. \u201cIn the heat of the moment and with the crowd roaring you on, balls go astray.\u201d The Wheel of Liverpool on the docks \u2013 stationary throughout this tournament for \u201cessential maintenance\u201d \u2013 was finally taking on passengers. The wheel was turning: it felt like a sign and perhaps it was \u2013 just not for the Roses. Instead a long-stalled New Zealand team, that finished with its worst ever placing at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games, were back in action, thanks to the coaching of Noeline Taurua and the return of a number of experienced (previously out of favour) players like Langman. Guthrie described England\u2019s start as \u201cdisappointing\u201d, although in the stands the emotion was more like collective shock. New Zealand scored five unanswered goals in just over three minutes. Maria Folau \u2013 booed, for the first time this week, as she took to the court \u2013 had spent the day before this game designer shopping with her husband, Israel. She demonstrated her own elan from the outset, curving the ball into the net in silky parabolas from every conceivable position, and even some inconceivable ones. It was New Zealand\u2019s defence, however, that was England\u2019s thorniest problem. Jane Watson\u2019s long arm was everywhere, tipping balls out of the shooters reach, and her zone defence alongside Casey Kopua kept Harten and Helen Housby so physically constrained that at times all four women seemed glued together in a single clump. And yet England bounced back. By the end of the first quarter they had reduced the gap to three goals; and in the second they looked, for a time, the team more likely to win. Folau had missed her first attempt after the break, the ball skewing a full 270 degrees around the rim.

With three minutes to play Housby dragged them back to within two goals, as the England bench screamed their approval. But no one could fashion a turnover and New Zealand began a game of playground catch to run down the clock.

Not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift</a>, who is on a righteous comeback trail, nor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\" title=\"\">Ariana Grande</a>, the trailblazer of 2018. <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8519573/rosalia-music-video-evolution\" title=\"\">It is an </a><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8519573/rosalia-music-video-evolution\" title=\"\">artist from Barcelona</a> who trained in flamenco at the Escola Superior de M\u00fasica de Catalunya, who wrote a <a href=\"https://themuse.jezebel.com/Rosal%C3%ADa-is-redefining-flamenco-1830164344\" title=\"\">university dissertation on a 14th-century Spanish manuscript</a>, and is <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/rosalia-nails-by-juan-alvear-nail-art-instagram-aute-cuture-new-song-music-video\" title=\"\">very big on nail art</a>.</p> <p>Taking the stage in Somerset House\u2019s grand old Thames-side courtyard flanked by half a dozen female dancers, Rosal\u00eda strikes a series of poses drawn from both Iberian tradition and contemporary street dance. One particularly fierce preying mantis arm posture recurs in much of the night\u2019s high-spec choreography. Her ruffled fuchsia top, matched with pink hot pants, visually combine proud folklore and Instagram-melting R&amp;B couture.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_4coiRG_BI\" title=\"\">Pienso En Tu Mir\u00e1</a>, tonight\u2019s set opener, has a few breathier passages that recall Grande, as does Rosal\u00eda\u2019s wind-blown ponytail. But Rosal\u00eda is emphatically her own phenomenon. Not for nothing has such a mainstream outlet as <a href=\"https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a28375921/con-altura-lyrics-meaning-translation-Rosal%C3%ADa-j-balvin/\" title=\"\">Oprah Winfrey\u2019s online magazine printed English translations of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s most recent lyrics</a>. This burgeoning popularity for an artist tipped since around 2017 is approaching escape velocity. Her 2018 album, <em>El Mal Querer</em><em> </em>(loosely, Bad Loving), was rightly a sensation. It refashioned the topic of her university dissertation \u2013 <em>La Flamenca</em>, in which a woman is imprisoned by her jealous lover \u2013 as its central theme, modernising it with cutting-edge production and an urban sensibility.</p> <p><em>El Mal Querer</em> continues to provide the backbone of tonight\u2019s electrifying set. There are hand-holds here for the casual observer getting to grips with this assured, multifaceted artist. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2WOIGyGzUQ\" title=\"\">Bagdad</a> borrows a melody from Justin Timberlake\u2019s Cry Me A River, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUBMPaj0L3o\" title=\"\">Di Mi Nombre</a> winks at Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Say My Name, attesting to Rosal\u00eda\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/28/meet-Rosal%C3%ADa-madonna-and-almodovars-favourite-flamenco-star\" title=\"\">grounding in classic </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/28/meet-Rosal%C3%ADa-madonna-and-almodovars-favourite-flamenco-star\" title=\"\">anglophone R&amp;B</a>.</p> <p>Just as compelling, though, is the older drama of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OMwDZUWl5g\" title=\"\">Catalina</a>, an update of a classic flamenco ballad by Manuel Vallejo that appeared on Rosal\u00eda\u2019s first album, <em>Los </em><em>\u00c1ngeles </em>(2017). She asks the crowd to be as silent as it can, for what is a masterclass in vocal control as Rosal\u00eda swells from racked coo to harsh anger.</p> <p>Perhaps even better is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQCmuEO13Tc\" title=\"\">A Ning\u00fan Hombre</a>. Here, Rosal\u00eda\u2019s dramatic a cappella is shadowed by a Greek chorus of backing vocals, laden with disorienting effects \u2013 far more like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fka-twigs\" title=\"\">FKA Twigs</a> than mainstream pop. \u201cA ning\u00fan hombre consiento que dicte mi sentencia,\u201d she declares \u2013 I\u2019ll let no man sentence me.</p> <p>For a mainstream-courting artist, Rosal\u00eda draws greedily from left field. Revving motorcycle-engine percussion and screeching tyres signal <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy4lZs8fVRQ\" title=\"\">De Aqu\u00ed No Sales</a> (You\u2019re Not Getting Out of Here), a series of threats of violence from a man to a woman. Soon the dancers are back, leading the fast hand-clapping \u2013 palmas \u2013 of flamenco, as the vocals themselves seem to pixelate.</p> <p>Rosal\u00eda has been touring these songs for some time now \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr7-yIJk3bg\" title=\"\">a few weeks ago, she wowed Glastonbury</a>. But recent months have seen a concerted uptick in excitement as she has teased what everyone assumes is a forthcoming third album with a series of fiery bangers.</p> <p>That most-watched video of 2019 \u2013 Rosal\u00eda\u2019s recent collaboration with Colombian reggaet\u00f3n singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/j-balvin-vibras-review-latin-superstar-brings-reggaeton-to-heel\" title=\"\">J Balvin</a>, Con Altura \u2013 came out in March.

Initially a Puerto Rican genre, reggaet\u00f3n has been spreading across the Spanish-speaking world since the 90s and has been happily co-opted by US hip hop and R&amp;B. (<a href=\"https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/youtubes-most-viewed-music-videos-of-2019-so-far__26819/\" title=\"\">An old hand, Daddy Yankee \u2013 reggaet\u00f3n\u2019s pioneer \u2013 currently holds the crown for most-watched music video of 2019, male or female</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiItGE3eAyQ\" title=\"\">Con Calma</a>.)</p> <p>Anglophone pop artists became wise to Spanish-language trends more generally a few years back, most obviously with Justin Bieber\u2019s reworking of Luis Fonsi\u2019s Despacito (2017). Pop stars such as Madonna have since fallen into line. Katy Perry jumped on Daddy Yankee\u2019s Con Calma last April with some verses. Having begun as a flamenco moderniser, Rosal\u00eda\u2019s entry into world pop was via reggaet\u00f3n. In 2018, her first massive exposure came on the back of her first collaboration with J Balvin, a guest slot on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1Ngb3MIQk\" title=\"\">Brillo</a> single, reprised tonight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0712cef4dfddad638f258f4cb19db17928bd4e1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0712cef4dfddad638f258f4cb19db17928bd4e1b/0_248_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singer performer Rosalia at Somerset House, London, for New Review, 16/07/2019.

      "bodyText": "Which female artist holds the record for the most-watched YouTube music video so far this year? Not Taylor Swift, who is on a righteous comeback trail, nor Ariana Grande, the trailblazer of 2018. It is an artist from Barcelona who trained in flamenco at the Escola Superior de M\u00fasica de Catalunya, who wrote a university dissertation on a 14th-century Spanish manuscript, and is very big on nail art. Taking the stage in Somerset House\u2019s grand old Thames-side courtyard flanked by half a dozen female dancers, Rosal\u00eda strikes a series of poses drawn from both Iberian tradition and contemporary street dance. One particularly fierce preying mantis arm posture recurs in much of the night\u2019s high-spec choreography. Her ruffled fuchsia top, matched with pink hot pants, visually combine proud folklore and Instagram-melting R&amp;B couture. Pienso En Tu Mir\u00e1, tonight\u2019s set opener, has a few breathier passages that recall Grande, as does Rosal\u00eda\u2019s wind-blown ponytail. But Rosal\u00eda is emphatically her own phenomenon. Not for nothing has such a mainstream outlet as Oprah Winfrey\u2019s online magazine printed English translations of Rosal\u00eda\u2019s most recent lyrics. This burgeoning popularity for an artist tipped since around 2017 is approaching escape velocity. Her 2018 album, El Mal Querer (loosely, Bad Loving), was rightly a sensation. It refashioned the topic of her university dissertation \u2013 La Flamenca, in which a woman is imprisoned by her jealous lover \u2013 as its central theme, modernising it with cutting-edge production and an urban sensibility. El Mal Querer continues to provide the backbone of tonight\u2019s electrifying set. There are hand-holds here for the casual observer getting to grips with this assured, multifaceted artist. Bagdad borrows a melody from Justin Timberlake\u2019s Cry Me A River, while Di Mi Nombre winks at Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s Say My Name, attesting to Rosal\u00eda\u2019s grounding in classic anglophone R&amp;B. Just as compelling, though, is the older drama of Catalina, an update of a classic flamenco ballad by Manuel Vallejo that appeared on Rosal\u00eda\u2019s first album, Los \u00c1ngeles (2017). She asks the crowd to be as silent as it can, for what is a masterclass in vocal control as Rosal\u00eda swells from racked coo to harsh anger. Perhaps even better is A Ning\u00fan Hombre. Here, Rosal\u00eda\u2019s dramatic a cappella is shadowed by a Greek chorus of backing vocals, laden with disorienting effects \u2013 far more like FKA Twigs than mainstream pop. \u201cA ning\u00fan hombre consiento que dicte mi sentencia,\u201d she declares \u2013 I\u2019ll let no man sentence me. For a mainstream-courting artist, Rosal\u00eda draws greedily from left field. Revving motorcycle-engine percussion and screeching tyres signal De Aqu\u00ed No Sales (You\u2019re Not Getting Out of Here), a series of threats of violence from a man to a woman. Soon the dancers are back, leading the fast hand-clapping \u2013 palmas \u2013 of flamenco, as the vocals themselves seem to pixelate. Rosal\u00eda has been touring these songs for some time now \u2013 a few weeks ago, she wowed Glastonbury. But recent months have seen a concerted uptick in excitement as she has teased what everyone assumes is a forthcoming third album with a series of fiery bangers. That most-watched video of 2019 \u2013 Rosal\u00eda\u2019s recent collaboration with Colombian reggaet\u00f3n singer J Balvin, Con Altura \u2013 came out in March. At nearly 550m views, Con Altura is, in many ways, a perfect pop storm. Sung in Spanish, the language spoken by 577 million people in the world, according to a recent study, and rising (Chinese is top of the table, English is third), it reaches parts of the world that Taylor Swift cannot. Tonight, it\u2019s greeted with ecstatic cheers by a crowd who are in great part Spanish-speaking, but not entirely. There\u2019s not a lot of flamenco in Con Altura; instead, reggaet\u00f3n looms large. Initially a Puerto Rican genre, reggaet\u00f3n has been spreading across the Spanish-speaking world since the 90s and has been happily co-opted by US hip hop and R&amp;B. (An old hand, Daddy Yankee \u2013 reggaet\u00f3n\u2019s pioneer \u2013 currently holds the crown for most-watched music video of 2019, male or female, with Con Calma.) Anglophone pop artists became wise to Spanish-language trends more generally a few years back, most obviously with Justin Bieber\u2019s reworking of Luis Fonsi\u2019s Despacito (2017). Pop stars such as Madonna have since fallen into line. Katy Perry jumped on Daddy Yankee\u2019s Con Calma last April with some verses. Having begun as a flamenco moderniser, Rosal\u00eda\u2019s entry into world pop was via reggaet\u00f3n. In 2018, her first massive exposure came on the back of her first collaboration with J Balvin, a guest slot on his Brillo single, reprised tonight. Con Altura, which was her second co-sign with Balvin, is more than just the right song in the right language with the right syncopation at the right time: it\u2019s also awesome. \u201cAltura\u201d is easy to grasp, whatever your mother tongue \u2013 Spanish for \u201cheight\u201d or \u201caltitude\u201d, loosely, \u201ccon altura\u201d here means \u201cwith swagger\u201d (with the merest hint of \u201cbeing high\u201d). The video is, playfully, set on a plane. In interviews, the 25-year-old is at pains to emphasise how visuals and choreography hold equal weight to her music. Flamenco is, of course, both cante (song) and baile (dance). In May another winning banger followed \u2013 Aute Cuture, a knowing misspelling of haute couture, again invoking loftiness. The video follows a gang of hard-as-nails manicurists; the song boasts a nagging chorus, and heaps of \u201caltura\u201d in the set, with Rosal\u00eda interrupting Con Altura to present a fan (the human kind) in the front row with a fan (the flamenco prop). A week ago, Rosal\u00eda upped her game again with the double-whammy of Dios Nos Libre Del Dinero (God Free Us from Money) and Milion\u00e0ria, collectively released as Fucking Money Man \u2013 a rare incursion of English into Rosal\u00eda\u2019s art. Performing it, the spotlight is on her alone, as the singer considers the root of all evil in one breath, and then, in an explosion of dancers, palmas and geyser-like vocals, plays devil\u2019s advocate for the folding stuff moments later. There\u2019s another outbreak of English in a captivating cover of James Blake\u2019s Barefoot in the Park, as per the collaboration between the two artists released in April this year. There have been questions asked in Catalonia about Rosal\u00eda\u2019s singing Milion\u00e0ria in Catalan, while using Spanish expressions: the guardians of the Catalan language consider it wrong to dilute it with Spanish. A debate also rages within flamenco over Rosal\u00eda\u2019s cultural appropriation of Gypsy traditions. But tonight\u2019s crowd has nothing but love for this artist, whose mission is to modernise the ancient emo of flamenco and play with genre assumptions.

      "body": "<p>Adrian Dunbar was born and brought up in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, before attending Guildhall School Of Music &amp; Drama in London. His stage credits include the Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal Court, while film work includes <em>My Left Foot</em>, <em>Hear My Song</em> and <em>The Crying Game</em>. On TV, he\u2019s best known as Supt Ted Hastings in hit BBC cop-corruption thriller <em>Line </em><em>of Duty</em>. This week, Dunbar directs a play at Happy Days, the annual Samuel Beckett festival in his home town of Enniskillen.</p> <p><strong>How did you </strong><strong>get involved with </strong><strong>the Beckett festival?</strong><br>Curator Se\u00e1n Doran found himself in Enniskillen and realised it was a beautiful town, located between two lakes, with incredible literary connections. Not only did Wilde and Beckett go to school here, but Brian Friel was born up the road, Seamus Heaney not too far away, same with Patrick Kavanagh, WB Yeats grew up in Sligo\u2026 It\u2019s the epicentre of an amazing concentration of writing talent. Se\u00e1n thought it would be wonderful place to hold a festival. Local people put him on to me and I was enthusiastic from the get-go.</p> <p><strong>The inaugural festival was in 2012. How has it evolved?</strong><br>It got off to a cracking start because we got decent funding and brought in powerful international artists. People were fascinated to see where Beckett spent his formative years. These landscapes influenced him hugely. He spent a lot of time swimming in the lakes and excelled at sport here.</p> <p><strong>Beckett was actually quite a cricketer, wasn\u2019t he?</strong><br>Yes, he\u2019s the only Nobel laureate to appear in Wisden. But not the only Irishman to be great at cricket, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/16/eoin-morgan-england-captain-future-chris-woakes-cricket\" title=\"\">as Eoin Morgan proved last week</a>.</p> <p><strong>Has the festival been good for the town?</strong><br>It\u2019s a two-way street: Enniskillen has done well out of visitors and locals have had their hometown opened up to them. We don\u2019t have many purpose-built venues, so Se\u00e1n puts on events in unusual spaces. You may never have seen inside the Methodist church, but during the festival, you can go in and listen to a fabulous string quartet play Schubert, Beckett\u2019s favourite composer. It\u2019s broken down barriers.</p> <p><strong>Coming back must be a trip down memory lane?</strong><br>Very much so. It also saves me explaining why I\u2019m here. People go: \u201cBack for the festival?\u201d I say \u201cYep\u201d, and that bit\u2019s done. It saves 20 minutes of small talk. As a kid, I remember being inspired by touring companies coming here to put on plays and meeting the actors around town. That\u2019s when I realised this could be a profession. That point of contact for young creative people in any town is really important. They might experience something life-changing. The arts don\u2019t care what your background is. They belong to everyone.</p> <p><strong>Tell us about the show you\u2019re directing at this year\u2019s festival.</strong><br>It\u2019s his late play <em>Ohio Impromptu</em>, one of only two pieces Beckett ever wrote on request. It\u2019s short, at only 12 minutes, but utterly mesmeric. Our production is on Devenish Island, so the audience take a boat to it, get off, enter a dark room, the lights come up and these two very particular-looking figures are there waiting.

It has a strange effect on people. When they get back on the boat, they\u2019re energised. People often say Beckett is difficult or bleak, but engaging with it is the most life-affirming, uplifting thing. It\u2019s his use of language. The music of the words works on your subconscious. You end up deeply moved but don\u2019t know why. That\u2019s where the magic lies.</p> <p><strong>Would you like to do more directing?</strong><br>The variety of switching disciplines is interesting, but I have to be careful.

The company has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/bmw-engine-production-uk-brexit-fears\" title=\"\">diverted some engine production out of the UK to Germany</a> to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit.

Data from property services company Savills showed that top-grade rental prices for shed space in London and the south-east rose by 16% year-on-year in the first half of 2019.</p> <p>The problem is compounded by the new exit date of October, in the run-up to the Christmas period when warehouse space is at a premium.</p> <p>Ben Fletcher, policy head at Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, said: \u201cThat presents both a cost challenge and an actual practical challenge of where you put the stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Make UK and almost every large manufacturer in the UK have warned repeatedly against a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers are preparing for a re-run of the tense build-up to a Brexit deadline as the country awaits a new prime minister who threatens to leave the EU without a deal. The UK is currently scheduled to leave on 31 October, forcing manufacturers to restart preparations for their worst-case scenario six months after the last scheduled exit date. Carmakers in particular have run short of options, after previously rearranging their production schedules to try to avoid possible disruption in the aftermath of the initial 31 March deadline. Jaguar Land Rover, the largest producer of cars in the UK, shut its main factories in April for a week to prepare for disruption to supplies. Germany\u2019s BMW brought forward its annual maintenance period and Vauxhall planned upgrades to its plant for its new Vivaro van for the same time. The production pauses dealt a temporary blow to the British economy, which shrank in the month of April, but a repeat in November would probably cause irrecoverable losses for carmakers, according to David Bailey, professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. Another round of production pauses \u201cobviously would impact the bottom line\u201d for carmakers, according to Bailey. \u201cThe [carmakers] can put workers on to flexible deals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an immediate impact on supply chains, who don\u2019t necessarily have the flexibility.\u201d BMW, which produces engines and Mini cars in the UK, has confirmed that it will not close its factories again in November. The company has already diverted some engine production out of the UK to Germany to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit. JLR declined to give details of its latest plans, although it is thought another shutdown is unlikely. November shutdowns would be much more difficult, said sources at multiple major carmakers. \u201cWhat was done in April was a bringing-forward of the summer [holiday], and you can only do that once,\u201d said one. There is also a mood of fatigue in some companies, with foreign executives unwilling to spend more on preparations that could be unnecessary for a second time. Ian Henry, managing director at AutoAnalysis, said: \u201cSeveral vehicle companies got their fingers burnt by investing so heavily for no deal at the end of March. Until they get a clearer picture, there\u2019s no point spending more money.\u201d However, Tim Lawrence, head of manufacturing at PA Consulting, said carmakers had conversely been given some flexibility as they face a declining market across Europe, meaning they may be able to deal more easily with disruption to supplies because factories are not currently running at full capacity. The six-month delay to the Brexit deadline has given some companies, particularly further down the supply chain, more time to make preparations that would not have been completed by 31 March, including stockpiling and making regulatory applications to EU agencies. However, some firms have experienced steep warehouse rental increases since the first deadline, meaning that the price of stockpiling goods and materials has increased. Data from property services company Savills showed that top-grade rental prices for shed space in London and the south-east rose by 16% year-on-year in the first half of 2019. The problem is compounded by the new exit date of October, in the run-up to the Christmas period when warehouse space is at a premium. Ben Fletcher, policy head at Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, said: \u201cThat presents both a cost challenge and an actual practical challenge of where you put the stuff.\u201d Make UK and almost every large manufacturer in the UK have warned repeatedly against a no-deal Brexit. With a new prime minister to be announced on Tuesday, executives are hoping that Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to win with bookmakers, will soften his position after a campaign in which he argued that the UK should leave the EU on 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. \u201cIs it bluster? Is it reality?\u201d said one insider at a large manufacturer with knowledge of conversations with Johnson\u2019s campaign team. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing in the margins he\u2019s far more pragmatic \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of posturing.\u201d Multiple big foreign-owned manufacturers have warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead them to close British operations. Peugeot, the French owner of Vauxhall, has warned that it will only build its new Astra in Ellesmere Port if the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit, starkly underlining the importance of smooth-flowing trade for British workers at foreign-owned companies. Airbus, the European planemaker, in January criticised \u201cBrexiteers\u2019 madness\u201d and warned it would consider closing British plants in the event of a no-deal Brexit.",

That would threaten the all-time low of $1.04 reached briefly in early 1985.</p> <p>Given the backdrop, holidaymakers remained remarkably phlegmatic. Phil Jones, travelling to Portugal with Tracy Spooner, said: \u201cIt was bound to happen. Capital is a coward, so any fear of no deal and it plummets.\u201d As they headed for their gate, Spooner added: \u201cIt\u2019s really not surprising.

When the cost of holidays abroad rises, Britons are more likely to go to Cornwall, Scotland or the Lake District than to Benidorm or Tuscany. The UK also becomes a cheaper destination for travellers from overseas: great news for the tourist hot spots such as Covent Garden and Regent Street in London, Stratford-upon-Avon, Cambridge and Bath.</p> <p>But for some of those departing from Luton, there was no escaping the fact that the pound doesn\u2019t stretch as far as it once did. Dave Jones, who owns an outsourcing business in Macedonia, said: \u201cIt does worry us because we have a business abroad, and it really eats into our spending.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>After what one currency analyst described as a no-deal arms race between Johnson and Hunt, the only way for the pound was down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Downward pressure on sterling is nothing new.

In what one currency analyst described as a no-deal arms race, both men said a key element of the agreement negotiated by May \u2013 the Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/hunt-and-johnson-the-backstop-is-dead-and-cant-be-in-any-eu-deal\" title=\"\">dead.</a></p> <p>But as far as the European Union is concerned, the Irish backstop is non-negotiable because it guarantees an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. In the currency markets, the prospect of the new prime minister being on a collision course with Brussels stoked fears of a no-deal Brexit, with a marked and immediate impact on sterling.</p> <p>In the past, the Bank of England would have acted to shore up the pound, perhaps by raising interest rates. But Threadneedle Street thinks there is little it can do because the weakness of sterling has nothing to do with the economy and everything to do with politics.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s policy will be to sit on its hands until it is clear what is going to happen on 31 October. Formally, the Bank\u2019s position is that a no-deal departure could see interest rates move in either direction, depending on whether the bigger threat is to growth or inflation.</p> <p>But that does not mean MPC members see the risks as perfectly balanced. They think rates more likely to go down rather than up if Britain leaves without a deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd08f7fb52888b8283d18242f6a567e84197dcc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd08f7fb52888b8283d18242f6a567e84197dcc9/0_147_4400_2640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chancellor Philip Hammond at the G7 meeting in France last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chancellor Philip Hammond at the G7 meeting in France last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the dollar looking strong and the UK economic news lacklustre, everything points to sterling\u2019s weakness lasting into the autumn.</p> <p>But the chancellor, Philip Hammond, told fellow finance ministers at last week\u2019s G7 meeting in Paris that the risks of a no-deal Brexit were no greater under either Johnson or Hunt than they were under May.</p> <p>Hammond\u2019s view is that the new prime minister won\u2019t have the votes to get no deal through parliament and that the EU will not back down, either. If he\u2019s right, there is scope for the pound to rally. But probably not until the holidaymakers leaving Luton are heading for the ski slopes rather than the beaches.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sun, sea and sinking sterling. News of a fresh decline in the value of the pound was greeted with forbearance by travellers at Luton airport last week. The currency has been under pressure at various times since the referendum, having fallen by 14% against the euro since the vote, and it hit a six-month low of \u20ac1.105 last Wednesday in the wake of renewed pledges by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt over pursuing a no-deal Brexit. Against the US dollar, sterling took even more of a battering last week, falling at one stage to below $1.24. And there could be worse to come. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say that were the UK to leave the EU without a deal on 31 October, they would envisage the pound trading against the dollar in a range of $1-1.10. That would threaten the all-time low of $1.04 reached briefly in early 1985. Given the backdrop, holidaymakers remained remarkably phlegmatic. Phil Jones, travelling to Portugal with Tracy Spooner, said: \u201cIt was bound to happen. Capital is a coward, so any fear of no deal and it plummets.\u201d As they headed for their gate, Spooner added: \u201cIt\u2019s really not surprising. I\u2019m sort of fatalist about it [Brexit].\u201d John Horton, who was flying to Mallorca, said the latest tremor on exchange markets had come at a bad time but was not shocking: \u201cI won\u2019t let it affect my spending.\u201d Indeed, he could see the positives. \u201cTo try and find a silver lining, it\u2019s also great for us as exporters.\u201d It is not only exporters that get a boost. When the cost of holidays abroad rises, Britons are more likely to go to Cornwall, Scotland or the Lake District than to Benidorm or Tuscany. The UK also becomes a cheaper destination for travellers from overseas: great news for the tourist hot spots such as Covent Garden and Regent Street in London, Stratford-upon-Avon, Cambridge and Bath. But for some of those departing from Luton, there was no escaping the fact that the pound doesn\u2019t stretch as far as it once did. Dave Jones, who owns an outsourcing business in Macedonia, said: \u201cIt does worry us because we have a business abroad, and it really eats into our spending.\u201d Downward pressure on sterling is nothing new. The previous century was punctuated with crises, from the moment Britain came off the Gold Standard in 1931 to the tumultuous day 61 years later when speculators led by George Soros forced the exit of the pound from the European exchange rate mechanism. The recent history of the pound has been all about Brexit. The pound rose in the days leading up to the referendum in June 2016 because the currency markets thought victory for Remain was in the bag. When news of the result came in, sterling immediately fell by 10% against the dollar and has been sensitive to Brexit-related news ever since. Prospects of a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit, in which the UK might stay in the single market or the customs union, have seen the pound rise; hints of anything harder have pushed it in the other direction. So when Johnson and Hunt used their last head-to-head debate to talk tough about Brexit, the only way for the pound was down. In what one currency analyst described as a no-deal arms race, both men said a key element of the agreement negotiated by May \u2013 the Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 was dead. But as far as the European Union is concerned, the Irish backstop is non-negotiable because it guarantees an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. In the currency markets, the prospect of the new prime minister being on a collision course with Brussels stoked fears of a no-deal Brexit, with a marked and immediate impact on sterling. In the past, the Bank of England would have acted to shore up the pound, perhaps by raising interest rates. But Threadneedle Street thinks there is little it can do because the weakness of sterling has nothing to do with the economy and everything to do with politics. The Bank\u2019s policy will be to sit on its hands until it is clear what is going to happen on 31 October. Formally, the Bank\u2019s position is that a no-deal departure could see interest rates move in either direction, depending on whether the bigger threat is to growth or inflation. But that does not mean MPC members see the risks as perfectly balanced. They think rates more likely to go down rather than up if Britain leaves without a deal. With the dollar looking strong and the UK economic news lacklustre, everything points to sterling\u2019s weakness lasting into the autumn. But the chancellor, Philip Hammond, told fellow finance ministers at last week\u2019s G7 meeting in Paris that the risks of a no-deal Brexit were no greater under either Johnson or Hunt than they were under May. Hammond\u2019s view is that the new prime minister won\u2019t have the votes to get no deal through parliament and that the EU will not back down, either. If he\u2019s right, there is scope for the pound to rally. But probably not until the holidaymakers leaving Luton are heading for the ski slopes rather than the beaches.",

      "bodyText": "The British government has summoned Tehran\u2019s top diplomat in London and warned UK ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz after Iran seized a British-flagged tanker off its coast, deepening the crisis in the Gulf. The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Saturday that he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to express \u201cextreme disappointment\u201d over Iran\u2019s actions, and vowed to protect UK ships during the crisis. \u201cHaving assured me last Sat[urday] Iran wanted to de-escalate the situation they have behaved in the opposite way,\u201d Hunt said on Twitter. \u201cThis has to be about actions not words if we are to find a way through. British shipping must and will be protected.\u201d A British Royal Navy frigate was just an hour from the scene when Iranian forces took control of the British-flagged Stena Impero, the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, told Sky News. She said the tanker was in Omani waters at the time. Hunt earlier promised a robust response if the tanker was not released, but said the government was not contemplating military action. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: \u201cThe UK tanker under Iranian control, and its crew, must be released. Escalation risks a deeper conflict, all sides must show restraint. \u201cTrump tearing up the Iran nuclear deal has fuelled confrontation. Its negotiated reinstatement is essential to defuse threat of war in the Gulf.\u201d Stena Bulk said in a statement: \u201cOur insurers in the region have been in contact with the head of marine affairs at the Port of Bandar Abbas, who has reported that the crew members of our vessel Stena Impero are in \u2018good health\u2019 and that the tanker is at the nearby Bandar Bahonar anchorage. \u201cThe head of marine affairs has asked a formal request be made for a visit to be arranged to the crew members and vessel. I can confirm this formal request is being prepared forthwith. \u201cOur insurers have also advised that the head of marine affairs has confirmed to them that no instructions have been received so far as to what will happen to the ship.\u201d The Cobra emergency committee met on Saturday afternoon to discuss the crisis, the second such gathering in under 24 hours. The standoff between the west and Iran has escalated at a particularly difficult time for Britain, just four days before Theresa May is due to hand power to another leader. Iran\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, the country\u2019s most senior diplomat in London, was also summoned to the Foreign Office over the incident, the Press Association reported. Iran\u2019s capture of the tanker and its 23 crew came two weeks after Royal Marines siezed an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, on suspicion of shipping oil to Syria in violation of an EU embargo, and just hours after authorities in Gibraltar announced that they would extend their custody of the vessel. Friday\u2019s action was widely seen as a response to the seizure of the Grace 1, which Tehran denounced as piracy carried out on the orders of Washington, and Iran on Saturday appeared to make the link explicit. \u201cThe rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law,\u201d Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s powerful Guardian Council, told the semi-official Fars news agency. Iran\u2019s moves to \u201cconfront the illegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers is an instance of this rule and is based on international rights\u201d, he added. The council rarely comments on state matters, but when it does it is seen as a reflection of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s views. Hunt said UK forces had followed international law. \u201cYesterday\u2019s action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar\u2019s legal detention of oil bound for Syria,\u201d Hunt said on Twitter. \u201cWe have been trying to find a way to resolve Grace1 issue but will ensure the safety of our shipping.\u201d A second Liberian-flagged but British operated tanker was also detained for several hours by Iranian forces on Friday. The Mesdar made a sudden diversion from its planned course, and began moving towards the Iranian coast before apparently turning off its tracking signal. Its Glasgow-based operator, Norbulk Shipping UK, confirmed that the vessel had been boarded by armed guards but had then been allowed to continue its voyage. Fars reported it was given a notice to meet environmental regulations. About a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes through the strait of Hormuz, the busiest shipping lane in the world for crude tankers, and under 25 miles (40km) wide at its narrowest point. Tensions in the Gulf had already affected oil trading, and Friday\u2019s tanker seizures caused prices to rise. Iran\u2019s official Irna news agency said the impounded Stena Impero had been detained after colliding with a fishing boat, whose crew notified authorities on land. Its owners say it was intercepted in international waters, by four small craft and a helicopter, when in \u201cfull compliance with all navigation and international regulations\u201d. The ship has been taken to Bandar Abbas, one of the country\u2019s main military ports, Fars reported. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said if the report was correct, Britain should rule out the use of force in response. \u201cThat\u2019s an important Iranian military port and I think any military options will therefore be extremely unwise,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Late on Friday night, the British government advised UK ships to stay out of the area \u201cfor an interim period\u201d and said it was talking to international partners. France\u2019s foreign ministry said on Saturday it was very concerned by the seizure of the Stena Impero, saying such an action harmed de-escalation efforts in the region. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry said it was an \u201cunjustifiable intrusion\u201d on shipping through a key shipping route and urged Iran to release the ship and crew. \u201cWe remain deeply concerned about Iran\u2019s unacceptable actions, which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation,\u201d a government statement said, following a meeting of ministers to discuss the incident in the strait of Hormuz. The detention comes at a time of high tension in the region, with US, British and Iranian forces facing off at sea. Iranian politicians have called for reprisals over the detention of the Grace 1. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards previously attempted to capture a British tanker six days after the Grace 1 was seized. On 10 July, a British warship, the HMS Montrose, intervened to drive off three Iranian military vessels that were attempting to divert a UK tanker, the British Heritage, towards Iranian territory. The battle of nerves along the oil export routes of the Gulf has involved other close encounters between Iranian, UK and US military forces. Earlier on Friday, Tehran denied Trump\u2019s claim that US forces had downed an Iranian drone over the Gulf, although the US president was adamant. The prospect of a diplomatic resolution appeared to be receding however after a senior US official on Friday dismissed a nuclear offer proposed the previous day by Iran\u2019s foreign minister. The official suggested the offer, made during a visit to New York, was not serious and called for \u201can actual decision-maker\u201d to enter talks to \u201cend Iran\u2019s malign nuclear ambitions\u201d. Trump has vacillated on what he wants Iran to do in return for a lifting of the oil and banking embargo that the US has imposed since walking out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran in May last year. The sharp response to Zarif\u2019s offer suggests that administration hardliners, led by the national security adviser, John Bolton, are currently running Iran policy.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls.

      "bodyText": "Police in Hong Kong are warning of possible violence on the eve of another mass protest against a controversial extradition bill after making \u201cthe largest seizure\u201d of explosives in the territory. The seizure came on the day that thousands of pro-government supporters took part in a rally. Millions in the former British colony have thronged the streets since 9 June to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist party. Many in Hong Kong believe Sunday\u2019s protest, which has been sanctioned by police, will end in violent conflicts, as in previous weeks. During the past two weekends, after tens of thousands of anti-extradition protesters participated in peaceful, sanctioned marches, hundreds have been locked into tense, hours-long standoffs with the police, who then used pepper spray and truncheons on protesters late at night while they tried to leave, arresting dozens and resulting in injuries among many protesters and police officers. Hong Kong police said in a news briefing on Saturday that they had arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of possessing explosives, after finding a cache of explosives and weapons in an out-of-town industrial building. Supt Alick McWhirter, of the explosive ordnance disposal unit, said police on Friday night found around 2kg of high explosives, triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, which was \u201cextremely powerful\u201d and unstable. \u201cI think without a doubt, this is the largest seizure we have ever come across in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. Steve Li, senior superintendent of the organised crime and triad bureau, said police also found petrol bombs, corrosive acid, knives as well as metal rods on the premises. Police said they also found anti-extradition bill banners and clothes emblazoned with \u201cHong Kong National Front\u201d, a pro-independence group. The group\u2019s spokesperson, Baggio Leung, told Hong Kong Free Press that he was not able to confirm why explosives were found there, and would only know more once the suspect was released on bail. In a separate press briefing, police used the discovery of explosives to justify why they have barred the Sunday protest from finishing in Central, the heart of Hong Kong\u2019s business district, as the organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, had planned. Police instead mandated that the protest should end in Wanchai, before the march reaches Admiralty, where the government headquarters is located, and Central. The move has angered many protesters but the police defended the decision by claiming that some planned to protest away from the approved route and threatened to use weapons. \u201cIn recent days, after the end of protests \u2026 some used the opportunity to create chaos, this includes blocking roads, charging police cordon lines and even damaging public properties and attacking police officers,\u201d Ch Supt John Tse, of the police public relations branch, said, adding that protesters had used metal rods and bricks to damage public properties and attack police. \u201cThese make us anxious about the situation tomorrow,\u201d he said. Violent conflicts erupted after peaceful protests in out-of-town districts Sheung Shui and Sha Tin last Saturday and Sunday. Police used truncheons and pepper spray against protesters, who threw objects such as umbrellas and plastic water bottles at them. After being chased by police into a shopping centre in Sha Tin late on Sunday, several protesters were also seen beating a police officer. More than 40 arrests were made. Meanwhile, thousands of government and police supporters \u2013 many from pro-China groups \u2013 took part in a rally in Admiralty near the government headquarters. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s prosperity relies on stability and economic success,\u201d said a businessman on stage. \u201cSay no to violence!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When comedian Eleanor Thom first decided to write about her life with endometriosis, a long-term and often incredibly painful gynaecological condition, she did so because \u201cI felt that this was the sort of thing I needed to read when I was a teenager. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of medical stuff out there but it\u2019s very much \u2018this is what happens; these are the theories behind it\u2019. They don\u2019t tell you how to live with it day after day.\u201d By contrast, Thom\u2019s book, Private Parts, which is published this week, is part memoir, part guide. Funny, honest and inspirational, it covers everything from \u201cHow to survive Horrible Hormone Treatments\u201d to what to do when colleagues and friends dismiss your pain. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff in there I have never talked about publicly until now, not even to my therapist or family,\u201d says Thom. \u201cIt became a really cathartic experience because I\u2019d been holding all these feelings in for years. Then I started talking about them and my world didn\u2019t burn down. That made me think: why wasn\u2019t I talking about this when I was 17? Why did I wait until I was 34?\u201d Thom is not alone in deciding to talk openly about the sometimes messy reality of her body. This month also saw the publication of Eleanor Morgan\u2019s Hormonal: A Conversation about Women\u2019s Bodies and Nimco Ali\u2019s What We\u2019re Told Not To Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway), while one of the summer\u2019s most talked about books is Lisa Taddeo\u2019s Three Women, which tackles the nature of female desire.

Thus Thom\u2019s book features remarkably honest interviews with novelist Hilary Mantel and writer and actor Lena Dunham about their own experiences with endometriosis, and Morgan\u2019s Hormonal probes the relationship between women\u2019s bodies and their minds, arguing that a failure to talk about everything from periods to miscarriages directly impacts on mental health.

      "body": "<p>As a former martial arts world champion, who trained daily and enjoyed camping and hiking at weekends, Stephen Bullough had always prided himself on leading a healthy life.</p> <p>Like most people, he thought very little when he was bitten by a tick on a camping holiday close to home in Wigan in 2014, never suspecting that this tiny bite would unleash an infection in his body that would one day leave him permanently incapacitated.</p> <p>\u201cHe had a rash on his right arm, which we put down to ringworm, so we put a bit of cream on it and thought nothing of it,\u201d remembers Angela, Stephen\u2019s wife. \u201cIn 2015, he started to develop these cognitive problems, getting words wrong. We laughed about it at first, joking, \u2018You\u2019re getting old now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But a year later, Bullough began to experience sudden seizures and muscle weakness, leaving him with severe difficulties walking. Over the past three years, his condition has rapidly deteriorated, leaving him unable to see, permanently bed-bound and often suffering multiple seizures at a time.</p> <p>\u201cLast May, he had a massive seizure and then his whole body was convulsing,\u201d says Angela. \u201cThat\u2019s the day he went blind and has never walked or seen since. He then started having back-to-back seizures; he\u2019s in hospital once a month because they just won\u2019t stop, regardless of how many drugs they give him. One weekend, he had 40 seizures.\u201d</p> <p>Bullough was eventually diagnosed with Lyme disease, an illness caused by various species of bacteria in the genus <em>Borrelia</em> that live in the guts of ticks. Once transmitted to humans, it can attack the immune system and lead to serious health complications such as arthritis, meningitis, neurological problems, even heart failure. While Lyme disease can sometimes be treated with antibiotics if detected early, not everyone responds and for patients such as Bullough who have developed chronic symptoms, there is currently no cure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97db8e1d0eebefc91c907b47f1db6913b1e83b4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97db8e1d0eebefc91c907b47f1db6913b1e83b4c/27_374_3420_2052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"adult ixodes ricinus tick on a leaf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An adult <em>Ixodes ricinus</em> tick on a leaf. Typically ticks will wait on plants to climb on to passing mammals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rasmus Holmboe Dahl/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is particularly concerning as Lyme disease appears to be on the rise, something scientists have attributed to climate change, creating conditions in which tick populations can thrive. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) estimate that <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng95/informationforpublic\">between 2,000 and 3,000 people</a> are diagnosed every year in England and Wales.</p> <p>But for scientists, one of the most tragic aspects of Bullough\u2019s story, as with those of many other patients, is that it could potentially have been avoided. In the late 1990s, the first preventive human vaccine, called LYMErix, was developed and 1.4m doses had been administered by the end of 2001. The data suggests it was highly effective, protecting against the disease in almost 90% of cases.</p> <p>LYMErix wasn\u2019t perfect. It was relatively expensive, did not work in young children, only protected against one strain of Lyme disease and was only available in the US. But it appeared to be the first step towards eradicating the disease for good. Anti-vaccine fear saw it vanish from the market, however, and with that, all scientific research and investment in the field ceased.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have people so desperate for protection, they\u2019ll take a canine vaccine never studied in humans</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Gregory Poland</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The death knell for LYMErix proved to be a theory that the vaccine could induce autoimmune reactions in humans. This was partially based on a study from 2000 that found the vaccine <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10639430\" title=\"\">contributed to arthritis in hamsters</a>, as well as entirely hypothetical concerns from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel, which approved LYMErix, that the immune system might overreact and begin to attack healthy tissue along with the <em>Borrelia</em> bacteria.</p> <p>These ideas were subsequently disproved, but the fear continued to spread. In 1998, the now retracted <em>Lancet</em> study linking the MMR vaccine to autism had been published and the modern anti-vaccine movement was gathering momentum.</p> <p>Class action lawsuits were filed against LYMErix\u2019s manufacturer after several incidents of arthritis were reported. But while the evidence suggested that these incidents were unconnected to the vaccine, sales began to plummet and in 2002, the product was withdrawn altogether.</p> <p>\u201cThe consequences have been that, until recently, no manufacturer has wanted to touch this,\u201d says Gregory Poland, who is head of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/vaccine-research-group/overview\" title=\"\">Vaccine Research Group</a> in Minnesota. \u201cSome of the anti-vax campaigners had published a statement saying that no matter what kind of Lyme vaccine they develop, we will organise mass protests and lawsuits. In the US, it takes about 10 to 15 years of research and about a billion dollars to develop a vaccine and get it licensed. Since LYMErix, nobody\u2019s been willing to risk that.\u201d</p> <p>One of the great ironies of the LYMErix story is that while human vaccine development was subsequently quashed, the situation for dogs has never been better. Effective canine Lyme disease vaccines have long been available in both the US and the UK and there are reports of desperate individuals in high-risk areas persuading their vets to administer it to them. Poland is even hoping to conduct a study looking at whether this vaccine has conferred any protection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac36adc25960d6c525c3b28c08a13cadc39ad65a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac36adc25960d6c525c3b28c08a13cadc39ad65a/220_0_2894_3830/756.jpg\" alt=\"an illustration of borrelia bacteria\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration of <em>Borrelia</em> bacteria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Science Photo Library/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very odd scenario,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a safe and effective vaccine licensed by the FDA and anti-vax campaigners reject it. But on the other hand, you have people so desperate for protection that they\u2019re even willing to take a canine vaccine that has never been studied in humans.\u201d</p> <p>But there are signs that the situation may be changing. The increasing prevalence of Lyme disease, combined with growing awareness about the threat posed by tick-borne diseases, has attracted new windfalls of government funding, particularly in the US.</p> <p>In 2018, the National Institutes of Health spent $23m on Lyme disease research much of it earmarked for vaccine development, and with this, private companies are starting to return to the scene. The current leader is Vienna-based biotech <a href=\"https://valneva.com/\" title=\"\">Valneva</a>, which is developing a vaccine that can protect against all six most common strains of Lyme disease in the northern hemisphere, and is currently in an ongoing Phase II clinical trial. If everything goes according to plan, this vaccine could be licensed commercially in five years.</p> <p>But the ghost of LYMErix is still hovering over vaccine developers. Valneva will end up testing its vaccine on more than 15,000 people before applying for licensing, to try and convince the public that it is safe. Despite this, it remains to be seen whether the product will prove commercially successful, as patient groups remain suspicious.</p> <p>\u201cThe Lyme vaccine was not successful in the past and it is our belief that not enough is understood about the illness to produce a second vaccine,\u201d says <a href=\"https://lymediseaseuk.com/\" title=\"\">Lyme Disease UK</a> cofounder Natasha Metcalf. \u201cWe do not know enough about the unique ways in which Lyme interacts with the immune system. People who have had Lyme do not gain immunity from the disease and we do not have enough research available on the best way to treat the illness. When so little is known, a vaccine seems premature.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A considerable part of the medical community does not believe there is a problem. Lyme disease is a dirty word</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Kim Lewis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because of such widespread patient scepticism regarding the idea of a Lyme disease vaccine, some researchers have proposed ways of protecting people from becoming infected that do not involve human vaccination. Scientists at the University of Tennessee are looking to develop a vaccine that can be encased in food pellets for mice and other rodents that carry ticks. The idea is that the pellets would be widely distributed in the environment in areas where Lyme disease is particularly prevalent and the vaccine would then kill the Lyme disease bacteria inside the ticks feeding on the animals.</p> <p>Not all patients are against the idea of vaccines per se. Some would rather see the money being invested in vaccine development spent on devising treatments for those who are already gravely ill with the disease, and have been left with no other options.</p> <p>Many of these patients feel neglected by the medical community due to the controversy that has long surrounded what is known as chronic Lyme disease. Despite numerous studies which have emerged showing that large numbers of patients suffer from chronic or Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), with symptoms persisting and worsening despite initial antibiotic treatment, sectors of the medical community both in both the US and the UK have refused to accept that the condition exists. A recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/well/live/lyme-disease-children-treatment-diagnosis.html\" title=\"\">opinion piece in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/well/live/lyme-disease-children-treatment-diagnosis.html\" title=\"\">New York Times,</a></em> which claimed that PTLDS was not a problem, provoked widespread outrage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dff293ce6469d5480aea411fcb4cae510647f26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dff293ce6469d5480aea411fcb4cae510647f26/0_65_3000_1938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"stephen and angela bullough sitting on the sofa with their two dogs at home in wigan lancs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen and Angela Bullough at their home in Wigan, Lancs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Cousins/SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne big challenge has been that a considerable part of the medical community does not believe there is a problem,\u201d says Kim Lewis, professor of molecular microbiology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cChronic Lyme is kind of a dirty word.

      "bodyText": "As a former martial arts world champion, who trained daily and enjoyed camping and hiking at weekends, Stephen Bullough had always prided himself on leading a healthy life. Like most people, he thought very little when he was bitten by a tick on a camping holiday close to home in Wigan in 2014, never suspecting that this tiny bite would unleash an infection in his body that would one day leave him permanently incapacitated. \u201cHe had a rash on his right arm, which we put down to ringworm, so we put a bit of cream on it and thought nothing of it,\u201d remembers Angela, Stephen\u2019s wife. \u201cIn 2015, he started to develop these cognitive problems, getting words wrong. We laughed about it at first, joking, \u2018You\u2019re getting old now.\u2019\u201d But a year later, Bullough began to experience sudden seizures and muscle weakness, leaving him with severe difficulties walking. Over the past three years, his condition has rapidly deteriorated, leaving him unable to see, permanently bed-bound and often suffering multiple seizures at a time. \u201cLast May, he had a massive seizure and then his whole body was convulsing,\u201d says Angela. \u201cThat\u2019s the day he went blind and has never walked or seen since. He then started having back-to-back seizures; he\u2019s in hospital once a month because they just won\u2019t stop, regardless of how many drugs they give him. One weekend, he had 40 seizures.\u201d Bullough was eventually diagnosed with Lyme disease, an illness caused by various species of bacteria in the genus Borrelia that live in the guts of ticks. Once transmitted to humans, it can attack the immune system and lead to serious health complications such as arthritis, meningitis, neurological problems, even heart failure. While Lyme disease can sometimes be treated with antibiotics if detected early, not everyone responds and for patients such as Bullough who have developed chronic symptoms, there is currently no cure. This is particularly concerning as Lyme disease appears to be on the rise, something scientists have attributed to climate change, creating conditions in which tick populations can thrive. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) estimate that between 2,000 and 3,000 people are diagnosed every year in England and Wales. But for scientists, one of the most tragic aspects of Bullough\u2019s story, as with those of many other patients, is that it could potentially have been avoided. In the late 1990s, the first preventive human vaccine, called LYMErix, was developed and 1.4m doses had been administered by the end of 2001. The data suggests it was highly effective, protecting against the disease in almost 90% of cases. LYMErix wasn\u2019t perfect. It was relatively expensive, did not work in young children, only protected against one strain of Lyme disease and was only available in the US. But it appeared to be the first step towards eradicating the disease for good. Anti-vaccine fear saw it vanish from the market, however, and with that, all scientific research and investment in the field ceased. The death knell for LYMErix proved to be a theory that the vaccine could induce autoimmune reactions in humans. This was partially based on a study from 2000 that found the vaccine contributed to arthritis in hamsters, as well as entirely hypothetical concerns from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel, which approved LYMErix, that the immune system might overreact and begin to attack healthy tissue along with the Borrelia bacteria. These ideas were subsequently disproved, but the fear continued to spread. In 1998, the now retracted Lancet study linking the MMR vaccine to autism had been published and the modern anti-vaccine movement was gathering momentum. Class action lawsuits were filed against LYMErix\u2019s manufacturer after several incidents of arthritis were reported. But while the evidence suggested that these incidents were unconnected to the vaccine, sales began to plummet and in 2002, the product was withdrawn altogether. \u201cThe consequences have been that, until recently, no manufacturer has wanted to touch this,\u201d says Gregory Poland, who is head of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group in Minnesota. \u201cSome of the anti-vax campaigners had published a statement saying that no matter what kind of Lyme vaccine they develop, we will organise mass protests and lawsuits. In the US, it takes about 10 to 15 years of research and about a billion dollars to develop a vaccine and get it licensed. Since LYMErix, nobody\u2019s been willing to risk that.\u201d One of the great ironies of the LYMErix story is that while human vaccine development was subsequently quashed, the situation for dogs has never been better. Effective canine Lyme disease vaccines have long been available in both the US and the UK and there are reports of desperate individuals in high-risk areas persuading their vets to administer it to them. Poland is even hoping to conduct a study looking at whether this vaccine has conferred any protection. \u201cIt\u2019s a very odd scenario,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a safe and effective vaccine licensed by the FDA and anti-vax campaigners reject it. But on the other hand, you have people so desperate for protection that they\u2019re even willing to take a canine vaccine that has never been studied in humans.\u201d But there are signs that the situation may be changing. The increasing prevalence of Lyme disease, combined with growing awareness about the threat posed by tick-borne diseases, has attracted new windfalls of government funding, particularly in the US. In 2018, the National Institutes of Health spent $23m on Lyme disease research much of it earmarked for vaccine development, and with this, private companies are starting to return to the scene. The current leader is Vienna-based biotech Valneva, which is developing a vaccine that can protect against all six most common strains of Lyme disease in the northern hemisphere, and is currently in an ongoing Phase II clinical trial. If everything goes according to plan, this vaccine could be licensed commercially in five years. But the ghost of LYMErix is still hovering over vaccine developers. Valneva will end up testing its vaccine on more than 15,000 people before applying for licensing, to try and convince the public that it is safe. Despite this, it remains to be seen whether the product will prove commercially successful, as patient groups remain suspicious. \u201cThe Lyme vaccine was not successful in the past and it is our belief that not enough is understood about the illness to produce a second vaccine,\u201d says Lyme Disease UK cofounder Natasha Metcalf. \u201cWe do not know enough about the unique ways in which Lyme interacts with the immune system. People who have had Lyme do not gain immunity from the disease and we do not have enough research available on the best way to treat the illness. When so little is known, a vaccine seems premature.\u201d Because of such widespread patient scepticism regarding the idea of a Lyme disease vaccine, some researchers have proposed ways of protecting people from becoming infected that do not involve human vaccination. Scientists at the University of Tennessee are looking to develop a vaccine that can be encased in food pellets for mice and other rodents that carry ticks. The idea is that the pellets would be widely distributed in the environment in areas where Lyme disease is particularly prevalent and the vaccine would then kill the Lyme disease bacteria inside the ticks feeding on the animals. Not all patients are against the idea of vaccines per se. Some would rather see the money being invested in vaccine development spent on devising treatments for those who are already gravely ill with the disease, and have been left with no other options. Many of these patients feel neglected by the medical community due to the controversy that has long surrounded what is known as chronic Lyme disease. Despite numerous studies which have emerged showing that large numbers of patients suffer from chronic or Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), with symptoms persisting and worsening despite initial antibiotic treatment, sectors of the medical community both in both the US and the UK have refused to accept that the condition exists. A recent opinion piece in the New York Times, which claimed that PTLDS was not a problem, provoked widespread outrage. \u201cOne big challenge has been that a considerable part of the medical community does not believe there is a problem,\u201d says Kim Lewis, professor of molecular microbiology at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cChronic Lyme is kind of a dirty word. But studies from Johns Hopkins University estimate that 10-20% of Lyme patients suffer from that condition.\u201d Angela Bullough says that years of seeing specialist neurologists who refused to accept that her husband had Lyme, or would offer treatment options that ignored his worsening condition, left him suicidal. \u201cMy husband was at one point last year contemplating committing suicide and I know there are quite a few people with Lyme disease that do, because of the fact you\u2019re simply left,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody believes you.\u201d As a result, most funding for research into new treatments comes from private foundations rather than government bodies.

On Wednesday, police used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/puerto-rico-police-clash-with-protesters-against-governor-ricardo-rossello-homophobic-texts\">teargas and rubber bullets</a> against thousands after a huge rally in the capital. Friday's protests ended peacefully.</p> <p>Rossell\u00f3\u2019s press secretary, Dennise P\u00e9rez, announced her resignation in a public letter in which she said she \u201cdrew the line\u201d after being called \u201ccorrupt\u201d in front of her young son. </p> <p>\u201cI pray for Puerto Rican reconciliation,\u201d the letter said.</p> <p>Protesters issued Rossell\u00f3 with a Sunday evening deadline to resign but the governor has shown no sign he plans to leave despite leaks of hundreds of chat messages that contain homophobic and misogynistic remarks, as well as jokes<strong> </strong>about those killed in Hurricane Maria, shared between Rossell\u00f3 and 11 members of his inner circle.</p> <p>The messages are the latest scandal to hit an administration reeling from criticism over its response to Maria, which pummelled the island in September 2017. The official death toll, revised by Rossell\u00f3\u2019s administration last year, was found to be 2,975.

      "bodyText": "Support for Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, continued to plunge on Friday, as influential members of Congress followed senior figures in his New Progressive party in calling for his resignation and thousands of demonstrators returned to the streets of San Juan. Protests outside the governor\u2019s mansion carried on into Friday night as thousands of demonstrators, some cantering on horseback, made their way from the island\u2019s capitol building. On Wednesday, police used teargas and rubber bullets against thousands after a huge rally in the capital. Friday's protests ended peacefully. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s press secretary, Dennise P\u00e9rez, announced her resignation in a public letter in which she said she \u201cdrew the line\u201d after being called \u201ccorrupt\u201d in front of her young son. \u201cI pray for Puerto Rican reconciliation,\u201d the letter said. Protesters issued Rossell\u00f3 with a Sunday evening deadline to resign but the governor has shown no sign he plans to leave despite leaks of hundreds of chat messages that contain homophobic and misogynistic remarks, as well as jokes about those killed in Hurricane Maria, shared between Rossell\u00f3 and 11 members of his inner circle. The messages are the latest scandal to hit an administration reeling from criticism over its response to Maria, which pummelled the island in September 2017. The official death toll, revised by Rossell\u00f3\u2019s administration last year, was found to be 2,975. A study by Harvard University indicated the number could be more than 4,600. On Friday morning, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Obama administration housing secretary, became the first high-polling Democratic presidential candidate to call for Rossell\u00f3 to go. \u201cI stand with the Puerto Ricans in the streets protesting for his resignation,\u201d Castro tweeted. \u201cExcessive force against them is not acceptable.\u201d Castro was joined on Friday evening by others, including the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, and the the Florida senator Rick Scott, a Republican, who also called on the governor to resign. On Friday Puerto Rico\u2019s resident commissioner, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, told local press she believed the governor should stand down. Gonz\u00e1lez, a non-voting member of the US House of Representatives elected by Puerto Ricans, said Rossell\u00f3\u2019s \u201clack of credibility has closed the space to fulfill the functions as the people of Puerto Rico deserve\u201d. US Democrats had initially been reluctant to call for the governor\u2019s resignation given Puerto Rico\u2019s status as an unincorporated territory. But, as the Trump administration has sought to gain political capital from the scandal, more entered the fray on Friday. Earlier in the day, the US representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the first Puerto Rican woman elected to Congress, added to the resignation demands. \u201cI have profound respect for the institutions of democracy and for the sovereignty of the Island\u2019s people,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said in a statement, adding: \u201cToday, I believe that the scandals emanating from the Governor\u2019s Administration imperil future federal assistance, meaning the people of Puerto Rico, who have done nothing wrong, could pay the price for the corruption of the few.\u201d The governor\u2019s office has issued a number of press releases throughout the day noting minor policy announcements and appointments as the administration attempts to portray an image of continued business. But Rossell\u00f3 is already facing significant backlash from senior members of his own party. On Thursday, former governor Luis Fortu\u00f1o, a member of the New Progressive party, posted an open letter calling for Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation. \u201cI call upon the governor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe future of PR is at stake and his figure makes it impossible to move on to the new chapter of our history.\u201d Fortu\u00f1o said Rossell\u00f3\u2019s presence in office \u201cmakes this process more difficult for everyone. For you, your family, our ideal and PR, let someone else finish your term.\u201d On the same day another senior party official, the Bayam\u00f3n mayor, Ram\u00f3n Luis Rivera Cruz, called on the governor to resign in order to avoid the lengthy impeachment process lawmakers are currently considering. \u201cI have no doubt that in your heart you want to achieve the best for Puerto Rico but in these circumstances it is almost impossible,\u201d Rivera Cruz said. \u201cOn the other hand, exposing oneself to an impeachment process would add even more to this paralysis, because of the time it takes, producing greater anguish.\u201d The Trump administration has not taken a formal stance on the matter but on Thursday the president laid into the administration and criticised the San Juan mayor, Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, a vocal critic of the president over Maria and its aftermath. \u201cA lot of bad things are happening in Puerto Rico,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe governor is under siege, the mayor of San Juan is a despicable and incompetent person who I wouldn\u2019t trust under any circumstance, and the United States Congress foolishly gave 92 Billion Dollars for hurricane relief, much of which was squandered away or wasted, never to be seen again.\u201d The president\u2019s claim that the island has received $92bn is false.

      "body": "<p>For a reputed \u201cstrongman\u201d, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan seems unusually nervous these days. <a href=\"https://ahvalnews.com/july-15/turkeys-erdogan-defiant-anniversary-2016-coup-attempt\" title=\"\">A bombastic speech last week</a> marking the third anniversary of a failed military putsch could not conceal his insecurity. He says he is using his sweeping powers as executive president to build a \u201cnew Turkey\u201d. But it appears the old one is tiring of him fast.</p> <p>\u201cThe 15th of July was an attempt to subject our nation to slavery,\u201d Erdo\u011fan declared. \u201cBut as much as we will never stop protecting our freedom and our future, those who lay traps for us will never cease their efforts.\u201d It was a typical pitch, blending nationalism with scare stories of secret foes, foreign and domestic.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan remains convinced his enemies are out to get him \u2013 and in the manner of all dictators, conflates his personal prospects with those of the state. The latest villains in this self-centred drama are the country\u2019s American and European allies who, as he tells it, seek to subjugate both him and the proudly rising Turkish nation. But freedom is a fungible concept in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey. <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/turkey-seeks-arrest-hundreds-alleged-gulen-links-190709064713175.html\" title=\"\">Tens of thousands of supposed plotters</a> have been jailed pending trial since 2016. More than 100,000 public sector workers have been suspended or sacked. Another purge preceded the coup anniversary, with more than 200 military personnel and civilians accused of treason.</p> <p>Particular concern is focused on Turkey\u2019s justice system. Britain\u2019s Law Society, citing the \u201cwidespread and systematic persecution of members of the legal profession\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/un-urged-to-act-over-purge-of-turkeys-lawyers-by-erdogan\" title=\"\">has reported Turkey to the UN human rights council</a>. Journalists have suffered similar intimidation. Most Turkish media now tamely toe the government line.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan has good cause to worry \u2013 but the real reason may be simpler: he has made a dreadful hash of things. During 16 consecutive years in power, Turkey\u2019s modern caliph has driven the economy into chronic debt, played regional power-broker with chaotic results, and scapegoated the Kurds for his failures. Now the bill is coming due.</p> <p>Turkey remains in recession following last year\u2019s calamitous currency crisis, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/business/turkey-economy-crisis.html\" title=\"\">amid fears a new financial crunch is imminent</a>. Unemployment and inflation are high and business is slack. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s sacking last week of the central bank governor was seen as a sign he will persist with his discredited strategy of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-economy-bailout-exclusive/exclusive-turkeys-restructuring-stalls-as-banks-government-wrestle-with-bad-debt-idUSKCN1UC25T\" title=\"\">spurring growth with borrowed money</a>.</p> <p>For the first time in years, his political grip is threatened. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AKP suffered local election losses in five of the six largest cities in March. He was humiliated again last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/erdogan-faces-scrutiny-once-more-as-istanbul-goes-back-to-the-polls\" title=\"\">in Istanbul\u2019s re-run mayoral election</a>. And his monopoly on power makes it harder to shift responsibility to others.</p> <p>External affairs is another disaster area. Scoring a spectacular double last week, Erdo\u011fan fell out with both the US and the EU in the space of a few days. In Washington\u2019s case, the row was over Nato member Turkey\u2019s decision to buy a Russian ground-to-air missile system. Some analysts suggest Erdo\u011fan wanted to demonstrate Turkey\u2019s independence. Others put it down to paranoia. <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-turkey-security-deal/u-s-officials-wonder-did-turkish-leaders-coup-memories-drive-russia-arms-deal-idUKKCN1UD0ER\" title=\"\">He reportedly </a>still suspects Washington of tacitly supporting the coup and protecting its US-based alleged leader, Fethullah G\u00fclen. </p> <p>Whatever his motives, the missile purchase led the US to cancel a sale of F-35 jets and threaten more sanctions. The cost to the Turkish defence industry, which would have made some aircraft components, is put at $9bn. Bigger still, potentially, is the cost to Nato.<a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/cutting-turkey-from-f-35-program-to-damage-ties-foreign-ministry-145045\" title=\"\"> The foreign ministry </a>in Ankara warned on Wednesday of \u201cirreparable damage\u201d.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s always tense relations with the EU, strained by the Syrian refugee crisis, underwent a simultaneous rupture. After Ankara ignored Cypriot warnings not to drill for oil and gas in eastern Mediterranean waters that Nicosia claims as its own,<a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2019/07/16/eu-sanctions-turkey-for-drilling-off-the-coast-of-cyprus\" title=\"\"> EU foreign ministers imposed yet more sanctions</a>. </p> <p>The notoriously combative Erdo\u011fan has fallen out with many regional neighbours over the years, including Syria, Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia, not to mention Greece. To break with the US and Europe in the same week is some achievement, even by his choleric standards. Yet Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/world/asia/turkey-erdogan-missile-trump.html\">supporters claim</a> it\u2019s part of a deliberate plan to boost Turkey\u2019s independent standing in the world.</p> <p>On this analysis, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-putin-turned-erdogan-against-the-west-ngd8sfd3j\" title=\"\">cosying up to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin</a> puts the US on notice that Turkey has strategic alternatives. It could help the economy, which needs Russian trade and tourism. And it suits Ankara\u2019s policy in Syria where, despite being on opposite sides, Turkey has collaborated with Russia and Iran.</p> <p>But this apparent tilt towards Moscow may yet prove another big miscalculation. Erdo\u011fan says he wants to stay friends with the US and be part of Nato \u2013 but has sowed grave doubts about his dependability. Meanwhile, Russian and Syrian regime forces have begun an offensive against rebels and Islamists in Idlib, Aleppo and Hama provinces, in north-west Syria. The offensive <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/russia-turkey-making-deals-parting-ways-syria-190515163715038.html\">contravenes a ceasefire agreed with Erdo\u011fan</a> last September that set up a demilitarised zone inside Syria overseen by Turkey. Its forces were attacked in two separate incidents in May. Fighting in Idlib has since intensified amid renewed civilian atrocities.</p> <p>Russia and Syria aim to finally bring the civil war to an end by storming the last rebel areas. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s aim is to extend Turkish-controlled \u201csafe areas\u201d eastwards along the Turkey-Syria border in order to hold Kurdish \u201cterrorists\u201d at bay \u2013 and prevent another refugee exodus. These aims look increasingly incompatible.</p> <p>At odds with the US, Europe, his Arab neighbours and potentially Russia, too, and increasingly unpopular at home, no-mates Erdo\u011fan is treading a lonely, destructive path towards a strategic and political dead end. The looming question is whether he will take Turkey down with him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For a reputed \u201cstrongman\u201d, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan seems unusually nervous these days. A bombastic speech last week marking the third anniversary of a failed military putsch could not conceal his insecurity. He says he is using his sweeping powers as executive president to build a \u201cnew Turkey\u201d. But it appears the old one is tiring of him fast. \u201cThe 15th of July was an attempt to subject our nation to slavery,\u201d Erdo\u011fan declared. \u201cBut as much as we will never stop protecting our freedom and our future, those who lay traps for us will never cease their efforts.\u201d It was a typical pitch, blending nationalism with scare stories of secret foes, foreign and domestic. Erdo\u011fan remains convinced his enemies are out to get him \u2013 and in the manner of all dictators, conflates his personal prospects with those of the state. The latest villains in this self-centred drama are the country\u2019s American and European allies who, as he tells it, seek to subjugate both him and the proudly rising Turkish nation. But freedom is a fungible concept in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey. Tens of thousands of supposed plotters have been jailed pending trial since 2016. More than 100,000 public sector workers have been suspended or sacked. Another purge preceded the coup anniversary, with more than 200 military personnel and civilians accused of treason. Particular concern is focused on Turkey\u2019s justice system. Britain\u2019s Law Society, citing the \u201cwidespread and systematic persecution of members of the legal profession\u201d, has reported Turkey to the UN human rights council. Journalists have suffered similar intimidation. Most Turkish media now tamely toe the government line. Erdo\u011fan has good cause to worry \u2013 but the real reason may be simpler: he has made a dreadful hash of things. During 16 consecutive years in power, Turkey\u2019s modern caliph has driven the economy into chronic debt, played regional power-broker with chaotic results, and scapegoated the Kurds for his failures. Now the bill is coming due. Turkey remains in recession following last year\u2019s calamitous currency crisis, amid fears a new financial crunch is imminent. Unemployment and inflation are high and business is slack. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s sacking last week of the central bank governor was seen as a sign he will persist with his discredited strategy of spurring growth with borrowed money. For the first time in years, his political grip is threatened. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AKP suffered local election losses in five of the six largest cities in March. He was humiliated again last month in Istanbul\u2019s re-run mayoral election. And his monopoly on power makes it harder to shift responsibility to others. External affairs is another disaster area. Scoring a spectacular double last week, Erdo\u011fan fell out with both the US and the EU in the space of a few days. In Washington\u2019s case, the row was over Nato member Turkey\u2019s decision to buy a Russian ground-to-air missile system. Some analysts suggest Erdo\u011fan wanted to demonstrate Turkey\u2019s independence. Others put it down to paranoia. He reportedly still suspects Washington of tacitly supporting the coup and protecting its US-based alleged leader, Fethullah G\u00fclen. Whatever his motives, the missile purchase led the US to cancel a sale of F-35 jets and threaten more sanctions. The cost to the Turkish defence industry, which would have made some aircraft components, is put at $9bn. Bigger still, potentially, is the cost to Nato. The foreign ministry in Ankara warned on Wednesday of \u201cirreparable damage\u201d. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s always tense relations with the EU, strained by the Syrian refugee crisis, underwent a simultaneous rupture. After Ankara ignored Cypriot warnings not to drill for oil and gas in eastern Mediterranean waters that Nicosia claims as its own, EU foreign ministers imposed yet more sanctions. The notoriously combative Erdo\u011fan has fallen out with many regional neighbours over the years, including Syria, Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia, not to mention Greece. To break with the US and Europe in the same week is some achievement, even by his choleric standards. Yet Erdo\u011fan supporters claim it\u2019s part of a deliberate plan to boost Turkey\u2019s independent standing in the world. On this analysis, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s cosying up to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin puts the US on notice that Turkey has strategic alternatives. It could help the economy, which needs Russian trade and tourism. And it suits Ankara\u2019s policy in Syria where, despite being on opposite sides, Turkey has collaborated with Russia and Iran. But this apparent tilt towards Moscow may yet prove another big miscalculation. Erdo\u011fan says he wants to stay friends with the US and be part of Nato \u2013 but has sowed grave doubts about his dependability. Meanwhile, Russian and Syrian regime forces have begun an offensive against rebels and Islamists in Idlib, Aleppo and Hama provinces, in north-west Syria. The offensive contravenes a ceasefire agreed with Erdo\u011fan last September that set up a demilitarised zone inside Syria overseen by Turkey. Its forces were attacked in two separate incidents in May. Fighting in Idlib has since intensified amid renewed civilian atrocities. Russia and Syria aim to finally bring the civil war to an end by storming the last rebel areas. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s aim is to extend Turkish-controlled \u201csafe areas\u201d eastwards along the Turkey-Syria border in order to hold Kurdish \u201cterrorists\u201d at bay \u2013 and prevent another refugee exodus. These aims look increasingly incompatible. At odds with the US, Europe, his Arab neighbours and potentially Russia, too, and increasingly unpopular at home, no-mates Erdo\u011fan is treading a lonely, destructive path towards a strategic and political dead end. The looming question is whether he will take Turkey down with him.",

But a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that Republican support for Trump climbed slightly after the comments. \u201cPeople have made up their minds completely about Donald Trump,\u201d said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone left to be converted. The election will be decided by who shows up.\u201d It will be a year before Democrats officially choose their nominee. Until then, Sabato said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Squad. Will they accept that Democrats cannot possibly win with just their adherents \u2013 that Democrats must win independents and moderates?\u201d Virginians have twice rejected Trump\u2019s politics of polarization, said Al Nevarez, a former chair of the Loudoun county Democratic committee. In 2017, the Republican nominee for governor, Ed Gillespie, embraced the president\u2019s rhetoric on crime and immigration, attacking his opponent on Confederate monuments, sanctuary cities and the Central American gang MS-13. The Democrat, Ralph Northam, won and his party made sweeping gains. In 2018, Wexton, Spanberger and Elaine Luria flipped three Virginia districts. Trump\u2019s suggestion that women of color \u201cgo back\u201d to their country \u2013 and Republicans\u2019 collective silence \u2013 could be a turning point for some conservatives who have not yet abandoned their party, Nevarez said. \u201cNo statement speaks volumes right now,\u201d he said. \u2018Americans and Virginians\u2019 Hassan Ahmad, an immigration lawyer in Sterling, Virginia, was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the House of Delegates. He lost but said he was encouraged by what he heard knocking doors. \u201cPeople were not just concerned about issues that affected them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cared deeply about the issues that affected their identity as Americans and Virginians.\u201d The stakes are too high, he said, for Democrats to become distracted. \u201cIf the division continues it will absolutely be used to pit the Democratic party against itself, and that will lead to a Trump victory,\u201d he said. Before leaving Washington this week, the factions agreed to truce. In a rare joint statement, leaders of the House Democratic Caucus and three ideological sub-caucuses called the party a \u201cdiverse, robust and passionate family\u201d and vowed to \u201cremain clear-eyed with respect to our unity of purpose\u201d. Trump\u2019s provocations will likely only escalate as 2020 nears. \u201cWe try to keep our eyes on the prize,\u201d Wexton said, \u201cand remember what people sent us here to do.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Some years ago Steve Bruce wrote a trilogy of football-based thrillers. Their hero was Steve Barnes, the all-action macho manager of Leddersford Town who devoted his spare time to solving murders and taking out terrorists in a style sufficiently swashbuckling to make even Lee Child\u2019s creation Jack Reacher seem a bit of a wimp.</p> <p>These days Newcastle United\u2019s new manager laughs about that brief excursion into the literary world, joking that <em>Striker</em>, <em>Sweeper</em> and <em>Defender</em> are so bad they have become collectors\u2019 items. So far, so lighthearted, yet, as he walks into Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s old office, Bruce\u2019s tried and trusted amalgam of humour and geordie charm will no longer be sufficient to disarm an army of critics on Tyneside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/18/steve-bruce-prove-doubters-wrong-newcastle\">Steve Bruce pledges to \u2018prove the doubters wrong\u2019 at Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is the impending \u00a336m-plus arrival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/18/football-transfer-rumours-joelinton-steve-bruce-newcastle\" title=\"\">Hoffenheim\u2019s Brazilian striker Joelinton</a> likely to quell dissent at a juncture which could soon leave Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor in desperate need of channelling his \u201cinner Steve Barnes\u201d.</p> <p>To say Tynesiders are underwhelmed by his installation is an understatement. \u201cWe\u2019d have preferred Fiona Bruce,\u201d ranks as one of the more polite jokes circulating in a city where Mike Ashley\u2019s soul-sapping ownership of the world\u2019s 19th-richest football club has left hope in short supply.</p> <p>If Bruce, who watched from the stands because of a visa issue as Newcastle beat West Ham 1-0 in the Premier League Asia Trophy in Shanghai, imagines an upbringing in Wallsend will offer him immunity from the resultant vitriol he is very wrong. Newcastle are trying to spin the appointment as a sentimental geordie \u201chomecoming\u201d but that sort of schmaltz no longer really washes in a much-changed region where his biggest problem will be that he is not Ben\u00edtez.</p> <p>It is said that no one is ever indispensable but, in the eyes of Newcastle fans, their adored Spanish manager was the exception. Whoever replaced Ben\u00edtez was inevitably going to be the subject of unfavourable comparisons, was always going to be cast as the unloved step-parent, but Bruce comes with the damning label \u201cjourneyman Championship manager\u201d pinned to his tracksuit.</p> <p>Few care that it is a perhaps unfairly dismissive badge that fails to account for an extensive body of work at 10 clubs featuring repeated promotions in sometimes difficult contexts. Still, the overwhelming consensus is that he is simply not good enough for Premier League Newcastle.</p> <p>Although eight months younger than Ben\u00edtez, the 58-year-old is cast as resolutely old fashioned. In reality Bruce has altered and adapted since his chastening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/30/steve-bruce-leaves-sunderland\" title=\"\">sacking by Sunderland in November 2011</a>. He is a superb man-manager with a winning human touch but, critically, is seen to not share his predecessor\u2019s grasp of fine detail and intricate appreciation of tactical nuance.</p> <p>The latter qualities separate Ben\u00edtez from so many of his peers and explain why he has not only won multiple trophies at assorted clubs but somehow managed to keep a weak Newcastle squad in the Premier League. It took almost every trick in his extensive playbook to secure two mid-table finishes and, even then, Ben\u00edtez presided over some lengthy losing runs. If it helped that the fans\u2019 adoration for the gilded choreographer who led Liverpool to Champions League glory induced almost unconditional trust, Bruce will not enjoy the benefit of similar doubt.</p> <p>As Alan Pardew discovered, the atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park is sometimes wonderful but it can also turn intensely toxic. Despite leading the team to fifth place, Pardew was to be seen as a puppet of the Ashley regime.

      "bodyText": "Some years ago Steve Bruce wrote a trilogy of football-based thrillers. Their hero was Steve Barnes, the all-action macho manager of Leddersford Town who devoted his spare time to solving murders and taking out terrorists in a style sufficiently swashbuckling to make even Lee Child\u2019s creation Jack Reacher seem a bit of a wimp. These days Newcastle United\u2019s new manager laughs about that brief excursion into the literary world, joking that Striker, Sweeper and Defender are so bad they have become collectors\u2019 items. So far, so lighthearted, yet, as he walks into Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s old office, Bruce\u2019s tried and trusted amalgam of humour and geordie charm will no longer be sufficient to disarm an army of critics on Tyneside. Nor is the impending \u00a336m-plus arrival of Hoffenheim\u2019s Brazilian striker Joelinton likely to quell dissent at a juncture which could soon leave Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor in desperate need of channelling his \u201cinner Steve Barnes\u201d. To say Tynesiders are underwhelmed by his installation is an understatement. \u201cWe\u2019d have preferred Fiona Bruce,\u201d ranks as one of the more polite jokes circulating in a city where Mike Ashley\u2019s soul-sapping ownership of the world\u2019s 19th-richest football club has left hope in short supply. If Bruce, who watched from the stands because of a visa issue as Newcastle beat West Ham 1-0 in the Premier League Asia Trophy in Shanghai, imagines an upbringing in Wallsend will offer him immunity from the resultant vitriol he is very wrong. Newcastle are trying to spin the appointment as a sentimental geordie \u201chomecoming\u201d but that sort of schmaltz no longer really washes in a much-changed region where his biggest problem will be that he is not Ben\u00edtez. It is said that no one is ever indispensable but, in the eyes of Newcastle fans, their adored Spanish manager was the exception. Whoever replaced Ben\u00edtez was inevitably going to be the subject of unfavourable comparisons, was always going to be cast as the unloved step-parent, but Bruce comes with the damning label \u201cjourneyman Championship manager\u201d pinned to his tracksuit. Few care that it is a perhaps unfairly dismissive badge that fails to account for an extensive body of work at 10 clubs featuring repeated promotions in sometimes difficult contexts. Still, the overwhelming consensus is that he is simply not good enough for Premier League Newcastle. Although eight months younger than Ben\u00edtez, the 58-year-old is cast as resolutely old fashioned. In reality Bruce has altered and adapted since his chastening sacking by Sunderland in November 2011. He is a superb man-manager with a winning human touch but, critically, is seen to not share his predecessor\u2019s grasp of fine detail and intricate appreciation of tactical nuance. The latter qualities separate Ben\u00edtez from so many of his peers and explain why he has not only won multiple trophies at assorted clubs but somehow managed to keep a weak Newcastle squad in the Premier League. It took almost every trick in his extensive playbook to secure two mid-table finishes and, even then, Ben\u00edtez presided over some lengthy losing runs. If it helped that the fans\u2019 adoration for the gilded choreographer who led Liverpool to Champions League glory induced almost unconditional trust, Bruce will not enjoy the benefit of similar doubt. As Alan Pardew discovered, the atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park is sometimes wonderful but it can also turn intensely toxic. Despite leading the team to fifth place, Pardew was to be seen as a puppet of the Ashley regime. It almost broke him and is a perception Bruce must avoid. The trickiness of his task is exacerbated by the lack of the silverware-studded CV which enabled Ben\u00edtez to delight his adoring public by turning subtly subversive and playing politics with Ashley through the press. Granted, Bruce has close pals among the north-east media but his room for manoeuvre is restricted severely by his title: head coach. This dictates that Steve Nickson, the chief scout, will provide him with players much as his predecessor Graham Carr furnished Pardew and then Steve McClaren with sometimes welcome, sometimes unwanted, signings. Bruce will have the final say but will not, as Ben\u00edtez did, block the long-planned acquisition of Joelinton. The Spaniard believed the 22-year-old was promising but overpriced and not ideally suited to his system and that, rather than blow the \u00a350m budget plus profit from sales proffered by Ashley on a couple of marquee signings, it would be better invested more evenly. After all, the squad has gaps at full-back, in central midfield, on the wing and, given the departures of last season\u2019s leading scorers Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and Ayoze P\u00e9rez, up front, too. Ben\u00edtez argued the case for recruiting a few older, experienced professionals but Ashley\u2019s approach revolves around signing under-25s with potentially high resale value and Bruce must work with what he is given during the transfer window\u2019s final three weeks. His friend Alan Shearer, a former Newcastle manager, tried to warn him off, exclaiming \u201cNo, no, no\u201d when Bruce discussed potentially replacing Ben\u00edtez over a recent dinner but it seems a defection which has disillusioned a lot of people at Sheffield Wednesday was driven primarily by emotion. His late parents always wanted him in charge at St James\u2019 Park. Bruce will not have forgotten Halloween 2010 either. That was the day his Sunderland side were thrashed 5-1 at St James\u2019 Park as Newcastle fans serenaded their then coach with choruses of \u201cWalking in a Hughton wonderland\u201d.

What a different path they\u2019ve had to the final compared to last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games.

Although Alexander claims this was her starting seven in a \u2018horses for courses\u2019 situation against South Africa, there is a thought in the back of my mind that perhaps she wanted to create a situation where the team had to have a close match in the semi to give them a boost for the final. It\u2019s an extremely risky strategy, but Alexander is a coach who appears to revel in risk. </p> <p>For now, enjoy the second semi-final, rest up tonight and prepare for a late one tomorrow as the Diamonds aim to take home their fourth consecutive Netball World Cup gold medal.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3301388f0845f89e310efc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T11:57:08.900Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Honestly, I can\u2019t say enough how much I love Erin Delahunty.

Neither goal attack looked especially convincing either - Tippett provided a lot of athleticism, but would only take the close shots, meaning she often crowded Thwaites\u2019 space.

      "bodyText": "It was far from convincing, but the Diamonds are a team who knows how to win. What a different path they\u2019ve had to the final compared to last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games. There they cruised through their semi-final against New Zealand and came in as team who weren\u2019t prepared for a close battle. Although Alexander claims this was her starting seven in a \u2018horses for courses\u2019 situation against South Africa, there is a thought in the back of my mind that perhaps she wanted to create a situation where the team had to have a close match in the semi to give them a boost for the final. It\u2019s an extremely risky strategy, but Alexander is a coach who appears to revel in risk. For now, enjoy the second semi-final, rest up tonight and prepare for a late one tomorrow as the Diamonds aim to take home their fourth consecutive Netball World Cup gold medal. Honestly, I can\u2019t say enough how much I love Erin Delahunty. Look at this match report she can smash out of the park after a game like that! What a star. England and New Zealand will be up next, with England having to be the clear favourites. However they need to be careful of complacency - although the Ferns are not the same terrfying super power they once were, coach Noeline Taurua is a very smart operator and she will have a plan to take this team down. Whether the Ferns can execute it or not, we shall have to wait and see, but they certainly won\u2019t go quietly. Ooh, this is fun - reader Abhijato Sensarma has sent us in a beautiful poem to summarise that match! Again, the Australians almost did not stick the landing But they still remain one of the last two standing The opposition they meet in the final will be decided soon But if one thinks the championship match will be smooth sailing, s/he\u2019s a loon A couple of thrillers might still be on their way If Netball wants to cut across the public conscience, it needs to be at its glorious best by Saturday! Hearing from Lisa Alexander now - she reassures everyone that her starting seven was tactical for this match and not about resting players: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to tell everyone that those players who started were our starting seven for South Africa. We certainly didn\u2019t take them lightly.\u201d Watson doesn\u2019t mind who the Diamonds play in the final - she is happy to take on either England or New Zealand. A well deserved award for her, she had control of the attack end all game. Reader Kate Cornish rode the whole game with the Diamonds, definitely feeling that heart rate speed Kate! So what happens now? Was Lisa Alexander hoping to get through that game without some of her big names. Most notably Caitlin Bassett didn\u2019t take the court at all in the semi-final. I\u2019m not sure I can think of any time the Australian captain hasn\u2019t taken any part in a world cup semi-final. Was she being rested or was Alexander looking for something different from her shooting circle? Neither goal attack looked especially convincing either - Tippett provided a lot of athleticism, but would only take the close shots, meaning she often crowded Thwaites\u2019 space. Wood\u2019s early miss really seemed to play havoc with her confidence and she didn\u2019t open up the game the way it seemed she might. Well that game didn\u2019t seem like it would be a nailbiter, but it certainly turned out that way. In the end it was the experience of the Diamonds in pressure situations that got them the win. A lot of question marks over their ability to back it up in the final against even tougher opposition. Lots of deep breaths to be taken before tomorrow. Q4 14 mins: Australia 55-52 SA Almost a miss from Thwaites but it\u2019s pulled back for obstruction. The Diamonds play the ball around conservatively, grinding out for the win. Q4 13 mins: Australia 53-50 SA It takes some time, but the Diamonds score again and get the lead out to four again. South Africa answer quickly however - they need a turnover. Q4 12 mins: Australia 52-49 SA If this match finishes in a draw, the game will go into extra time, as it\u2019s a sudden death match. Jo Weston is not keen to play a second longer than she has to clearly, pulling in an intercept to take the Diamonds\u2019 lead out. Q4 10 mins: Australia 50-49 SA A few key intercepts from the Diamonds through Watson and Weston, bring a bit more confidence to the Australians, but South Africa answer with some turnovers of their own and close the lead back down. Q4 9 mins: Australia 50-46 SA Still no misses from Thwaites who has been a rock under the post. Wood however looks nervous after her first missed shot. Wood of course plays with Maweni and Pretorius at the Sunshine Coast Lightning and they will know how to get in her head. Q4 7 mins: Australia 47-45 SA It\u2019s amazing how confidence breeds confidence. The closer the margin becomes, the better the Proteas play. Every big play from one of their players lifts them to a higher level and their full court defence is outstanding. The Diamonds have panic in their eyes, they need to settle and regain their earlier confidence. Q4 5 mins: Australia 45-43 SA Still plenty of love in stadium for the Proteas, the English fans clearly keen to see Australia miss their first ever world cup final. Huge cheers when Hadley struggles to find the shooters and gets called for held ball. Q4 3 mins: Australia 44-41 SA Heads are high among the South Africans - they are obviously happy with their efforts against the world number 1. Wood takes a long shot for the Diamonds and it doesn\u2019t pay off, the Proteas get a rebound. Unfortunately for them, they can\u2019t convert. Q4 1 min: Australia 43-40 SA Changes have been made - Bruce is indeed on at GK, Watson back at C, with Hadley moving to WA and Wood on at GA. Meanwhile Griesel has come on at WA for the Proteas. Folks, we have a game on our hands! This break has come at good time for the Diamonds, they need to settle and not let panic come into their game. Thwaites looked calm slotting the penalty after the whistle, but things will no doubt heat up as the end draws nearer. I\u2019ll predict that Lisa Alexander will bring Bruce on at GK and Watson back on in C. Q3 14 mins: Australia 41-38 SA PRETORIUS!!!! She has worked her way into this match and she will not leave anything out there. Q3 12 mins: Australia 41-35 SA The lead has eroded for the Diamonds and the Proteas are looking more confident as they draw closer. Holtzhausen is looking much more involved in the game and that can only be a good thing for the team. Some Pretorius magic can\u2019t be converted though, which may put the brakes on. Q3 9 mins: Australia 39-33 SA The Proteas are starting to rediscover their flow in attack that they had earlier in this game, but they will need to pull in considerably more turnovers to push the Diamonds to the end of this game. Q3 7 mins: Australia 37-30 SA The Diamonds are struggling a little to hit circle edge, which is the strongest feeding position. However the Proteas are letting them off the hook a little with penalties given away to allow them an easy passage after a few pressure passes. Q3 5 mins: Australia 35-28 SA Holtzhausen plays herself into the game with a mid-range shot - one of very few that have been taken in this game. However a turnover on their centre pass stops them from scoring two in a row. Q3 3 mins: Australia 34-26 SA Australia taking time to adjust to the change to their attacking end, not as smooth a path to the post. They are still scoring, but it\u2019s taking them longer than it did at the end of the second quarter. Q3 1 min: Australia 32-24 SA Changes have been made - the Diamonds decided to sub their stats leader Liz Watson for Kelsey Browne. Meanwhile for the Proteas, Chawane comes on at WD. Lots of unique ways people are catching this game tonight, include this from Collingwood Magpies\u2019 Ash Brazill. You have to think that\u2019s poor scheduling from her wife\u2019s netball club though! Having a look at the stats, Liz Watson is doing a power of work at WA. With 13 centre pass receives, 19 feeds and 16 goal assists, she is the dominant force in that attack end. By contrast Paige Hadley has only seven goal assists and eight feeds. The defence line have been quiet stats-wise, with Jo Weston with just one intercept and one gain and Sarah Klau yet to pull in any intercepts or gains. The defence has been a lot more focussed on strong hands over down the court and grinding down their opponents, however I\u2019m sure Lisa Alexander will be hoping for more turnover ball from her defenders in the second half. This is the Diamonds\u2019 game to lose now. They are much more settled, finding space easily in the circle. While they still aren\u2019t confident to take long shots, it\u2019s not affecting them at the moment, as the shooter to shooter play is sharp enough to get the ball through. However if they find themselves up against the Roses tomorrow, they may need to be able to mix it up in the circle and have a Plan B. Q2 13 mins: Australia 28-21 SA There is a hesitancy to take longer range shots from both Diamonds shooters at the moment. It puts a lot of pressure on the feeders to get the ball close to the post. Q2 10 mins: Australia 26-19 SA Potgieter is being pushed hard by her own players who aren\u2019t giving her any easy feeds. To her credit, she is pulling them in, but will make it easier for herself if she stays on her hold a millisecond longer. Q2 8 mins: Australia 23-17 SA The Diamonds are improving as this game goes on. The attack is looking much more fluent and their full court defence is looking tougher and more confident. They are still not playing the level they would be aiming for, but will be happy with the improvement. Q2 6 mins: Australia 20-15 SA Thwaites\u2019 baulks don\u2019t seem to be drawing the same umpire attention - no held balls called on her as yet. Let\u2019s keep an eye on it when the Diamonds\u2019 are back down the other end of the court. Q2 4 mins: Australia 17-14 SA The Proteas appear to struggle with a static start - setting up after a penalty rather than coming up court with speed. We might see the Diamonds try to exploit that by forcing more penalties and making the Proteas reset more often. Q2 2 mins: Australia 17-12 SA Short three seconds from the umpires in this game - plenty of held balls being called on the Proteas\u2019 shooters. And the first lift of the game with Maweni getting Pretorius up over Tippett\u2019s shot, but to no avail. Q2 1 min: Australia 15-10 SA No changes to either side as predicted. Thwaites still not looking confident on the shot, she passes off to Tippett instead of taking the first shot. While it\u2019s a lead for the Diamonds, it doesn\u2019t look like a convincing start from the reigning world champions. Thwaites does tend to grow into a game though, as we have seen with the Melbourne Vixens, so it will be interesting to see if Alexander is prepared to let this line up work their way into the game. I wouldn\u2019t expect changes from either team at this stage. Q1 14 mins: Australia 12-10 SA Lots of end to end play at the moment - neither team are completely confident in getting the ball into their attacking end and defensive pressure is immense. Q1 12 mins: Australia 10-8 SA The Diamonds are having no trouble getting turnover ball but they will need to step up their conversion rate from turnovers. Cath Cox in commentary wants Thwaites to turn and shoot more often rather than passing out. Q1 10 mins: Australia 7-7 SA Miscommunication has been the theme of the quarter for the Diamonds. Has this line had enough time to gel to get a semi-final win? Q1 9 mins: Australia 6-6 SA Very scrappy play from the Diamonds somehow ends up with the ball in Thwaites\u2019 hands under the post to equalise. They look to go one up, but access to the circle is hard to find at the moment. Q1 7 mins: Australia 5-6 SA More fluidity in ball movement for the Proteas now, while the Diamonds still struggle to penetrate the defence. Q1 6 mins: Australia 4-5 SA The Proteas defence unit is looking in much sharper form than they did against the Roses. However they still don\u2019t look fluent in attack - it\u2019s a very stop/start progression down court. Q1 3 mins: Australia 1-2 SA A nervous start from both teams, not much smooth movement down court. It\u2019s a very defensive game so far. 1 min: Australia 0-1 SA An early win for the Proteas with Thwaites unable to handle a high ball on its first trip down their attacking end. But they can\u2019t capitalise. The teams are running out on court now, the Diamonds looking relaxed and confident. Erin has noted that now the game is about to begin, the crowd is now getting behind the Proteas! Interesting times, let\u2019s go! Big incentive for the Proteas with 1,000,000 ZAR on offer for each player if they come away with the gold medal. So they will want to give themselves every chance to do that by winning tonight and reaching their first world cup final since 1995. Hearing from Norma Plummer now. \u201cThey don\u2019t look as nervous as I thought they might. I think they\u2019ll just come out and give it a really good go.\u201d She also reassures us that Bongiwe Msomi is 100% fit after her ankle injury against the Roses, which is great to hear. I\u2019m pretty happy with this broadcast line up, which includes my two favourite netballers of all time - Nat Medhurst and Sharelle McMahon. They will provide some excellent insights. Medhurst feels that South Africa may take offence at Alexander completely changing up her line up from what she clearly considered her top 7 in the Ferns game, so it will be interested to see if the Proteas come out fired up. Alvin and the Chipmunks is finally over so it appears we will get some TV coverage started soon. I\u2019m very glad this important eight year old movie got to run its course before the small matter of a World Cup semi final gets to be covered. Some thoughts from Erin inside the stadium: \u201cAwesome to see so many Diamonds fans in the house. I swear I see a few red shirts cheering for Diamonds as they come out too. I reckon the Poms want an Eng v Aus final.\u201d Interesting as they seemed to be on the Diamonds\u2019 side against the Ferns too. If the Diamonds do progress tonight I hope they\u2019ve enjoyed this crowd support while it lasted though, because they will turn on them big time tomorrow! Some interesting thoughts on social media regarding Lisa Alexander\u2019s starting line. Quite a few people thinking it\u2019s giving the benchies a run because they expect to win and win easily. Good summary of what it could be from former Roses player Pamela Cookey. And of course after this game we have the other semi final - between England and New Zealand. England cruised to victory against SA and will be going in pretty confidently. Gone are the days when the Ferns could easily account for the Roses. Although the English team don\u2019t play against many of the Ferns these day, a fair few of this crop of Roses played in the ANZ Championship days and the players will all be pretty familiar with each other. We\u2019re still about 30 mins away from the first centre pass, so now is a good time to catch up on the news from the past few days. Emma John was all over the England v South Africa game a couple of days ago, so check it out to get up to speed if you couldn\u2019t quite wake up at 5am to watch it. No surprises here, this has looked like their strongest line up, though I\u2019ll be looking for for a GA change if Holtzhausen struggles again. GS Lenize Potgieter GA Maryka Holtzhausen WA Bongiwe Msomi C Erin Burger WD Shadine van der Merwe GD Karla Pretorius GK Phumza Maweni This is a very different line up that started against NZ. I\u2019m not sure if Lisa Alexander is hoping for something different or is perhaps taking this match up a little lightly? GS Caitlin Thwaites GA Gretel Tippett WA Liz Watson C Paige Hadley WD Jamie-Lee Price GD Jo Weston GK Sarah Klau The Diamonds would appear to be in the box seat for this one - despite a scrappy second half against New Zealand where they only came away with the win by one goal - they have looked the more in form of the two teams. South Africa had a strong start to the World Cup but perhaps played their final against Jamaica, when they beat the world number two to qualify for the semi finals.

The social stigma around female desire that Noori notes is one big factor, but another obvious explanation is that porn is largely designed by and for men. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/feb/27/sex-tech-pioneer-cindy-gallop-a-man-is-not-a-financial-strategy\">sex tech pioneer Cindy Gallop</a> told me over email \u201cany industry dominated by men at the top inevitably produces output that is objectifying, objectionable and offensive to women\u201d. Gallop runs a user-generated videosharing startup called MakeLoveNotPorn, which she says is enjoyed by women and men equally. \u201cSo much so, that with those of our MakeLoveNotPornstars who are straight couples, we\u2019ve found it\u2019s usually the woman who\u2019s decided she wants to socially share their #realworldsex, and persuaded the man.\u201d</p> <p>But enough about porn. What makes this new study important isn\u2019t really what it says about pornographic consumption, it\u2019s what it says about patriarchal control. We\u2019ve been trained to believe men are biologically wired to be far more sexual than women, and this junk science is used to excuse a lot of bad behavior. Women shouldn\u2019t dress \u201cprovocatively\u201d, we\u2019re told, because men are visual creatures who are easily distracted and can\u2019t control their urges; if you wear skimpy clothing, you\u2019re asking for it.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Cover up, men! You\u2019re distracting women Shocking neuroscience news this week, as a rousing new study discovers women have sex drives. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Germany analyzed brain-imaging findings from a wide body of research and found that the \u201cthe neuronal response to visual sexual stimuli \u2026 is independent of biological sex\u201d. In other words, women and men get just as horny when they look at erotic imagery. These revelations were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. While the conclusion of this study may seem blindingly obvious to most women, it counters previous research which found men were more likely to respond to visual sexual stimuli.

As far as preseason friendlies go there was no quarter given by either side, both teams went out to win, and the atmosphere crackled as you would expect from a match to celebrate the opening of a new stadium.</p> <p>Leeds left it late but were well worth their victory. Pablo Hernandez was the game\u2019s decisive actor, probing throughout then taking matters into his own hands in the closing stages to make sure his side left Australia with a victory. Alongside the Spaniard Jack Harrison was excellent, as were the two full-backs, bombing down the flacks and creating overlaps all night. The form of Patrick Bamford might be of some concern. On another night the striker could have bagged a hat-trick but he looked a little off the pace close to the start of the Championship season. </p> <p>Just the spectacle alone of almost 25,000 fans in the brand new arena made the night a success for Western Sydney but they played their part on the field as well. The back five stood up under immense pressure with Tass Mourdoukoutas commanding in the air and both Daniel Lopar and Nick Suman impressing between the sticks. Further forward Keanu Baccus caught the eye in midfield and Mitch Duke looked at home against strong opposition leading the line. Plenty to keep Markus Babbel smiling at the very start of preseason.</p> <p>That\u2019s all for now. Thank you for your company tonight, and welcome to Australian football Bankwest Stadium. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7bd8a91d6f99b8605da591846c7e879b4f81176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7bd8a91d6f99b8605da591846c7e879b4f81176/0_0_4506_3004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leeds United fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leeds supporters swelled the numbers of the first football match at Bankwest Stadium in Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d32f6d98f08cf92bb7739cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T11:11:58.397Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Western Sydney 1-2 Leeds United</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Full-time at Bankwest Stadium and Leeds leave Sydney deserved winners. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d32f67c8f0845f89e310e96\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T11:11:18.760Z\">12.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GOAL!

Jack Harrison caught the eye the other night and should prove a handful for the Wanderers defence. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LUFC/status/1152495796748783619\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udccb | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LUFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LUFC</a> Starting XI to face Western Sydney Wanderers:<br><br>Casilla, Douglas, Cooper, Berardi, Dallas, Phillips, Bogusz, Hernandez, Harrison, Roofe, Bamford <a href=\"https://t.co/XhWvVucl5Z\">pic.twitter.com/XhWvVucl5Z</a></p>&mdash; Leeds United (@LUFC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LUFC/status/1152495796748783619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 20, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d32d0f18f0845f89e310d8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T08:29:45.162Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BankwestStadium/status/1152492006083457024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dream come true for thousands of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LUFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LUFC</a> fans at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BankwestStadium?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BankwestStadium</a> tonight \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb Awesome to see all of the support! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WSWvLUFC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WSWvLUFC</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeedsInSydney?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LeedsInSydney</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OacReQTfSL\">pic.twitter.com/OacReQTfSL</a></p>&mdash; Bankwest Stadium (@BankwestStadium) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BankwestStadium/status/1152492006083457024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 20, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d32ced98f0845f89e310d7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-20T08:28:08.868Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Leeds United are well supported in Australia and it\u2019s no surprise.

      "bodyText": "That was fun. As far as preseason friendlies go there was no quarter given by either side, both teams went out to win, and the atmosphere crackled as you would expect from a match to celebrate the opening of a new stadium. Leeds left it late but were well worth their victory. Pablo Hernandez was the game\u2019s decisive actor, probing throughout then taking matters into his own hands in the closing stages to make sure his side left Australia with a victory. Alongside the Spaniard Jack Harrison was excellent, as were the two full-backs, bombing down the flacks and creating overlaps all night. The form of Patrick Bamford might be of some concern. On another night the striker could have bagged a hat-trick but he looked a little off the pace close to the start of the Championship season. Just the spectacle alone of almost 25,000 fans in the brand new arena made the night a success for Western Sydney but they played their part on the field as well. The back five stood up under immense pressure with Tass Mourdoukoutas commanding in the air and both Daniel Lopar and Nick Suman impressing between the sticks. Further forward Keanu Baccus caught the eye in midfield and Mitch Duke looked at home against strong opposition leading the line. Plenty to keep Markus Babbel smiling at the very start of preseason. That\u2019s all for now. Thank you for your company tonight, and welcome to Australian football Bankwest Stadium. Full-time at Bankwest Stadium and Leeds leave Sydney deserved winners. Finally! At long last Leeds score a second. After spending all night doing everything but score or assist Hernandez shows supreme control to jig his way through a forest of Western Sydney legs before shooting beyond the diving Suman with his left foot. 90+2 mins: Hernandez hits the bar! Then Bamford is inches away from sliding the ball into an empty net! How are Leeds not ahead? Hernandez again finds space on the edge of the box and instead of passing he unleashes a wicked strike that cannons off the crossbar. The bouncing ball is then drilled across the face of goal but the despairing Bamford can\u2019t provide the finishing touch. 89 mins: Leeds are pushing hard for a winner. Bielsa is clearly not satisfied leaving Sydney with a training run under his belt, he wants a victory. Hernandez\u2019s impish probing keeps the Wanderers on their toes before a shot on the turn out of nothing from Bamford forces Suman into a splendid save low to his right. \u201cBased on the evidence, who\u2019s been your Player of the Match so far?\u201d asks Abhijato Sensarma. I think Harrison has been the best player on the pitch although his statistical return is diminished because teammates haven\u2019t honoured his lead-up play. Dallas has impressed, Hernandez has been tricky despite a lack of end product, while for WSW Duke and Baccus have been the standout pair for mine. 85 mins: Another shot on goal from Leeds, another one miles off target, this time from Hernandez following a trademark jinking run through the middle. 84 mins: Late free-kick to Leeds, about 30-yards out, decent sighter for a left-footer but when Douglas wraps his left peg around the ball he can\u2019t find the target. 81 mins: Nice spell from the Wanderers youngsters who are taking the game to a tiring Leeds late on. Lochlan Constable in particular has caught the eye with his industry and confidence. He\u2019s powerless to stop another rampaging run down the right from Dallas though and this time there is an end product but after receiving the layoff Stevens can\u2019t decide whether to cross or shoot and ends up dragging his effort wide of the post to the frustration of the travelling fans. Leeds have wasted so many good opportunities tonight. 78 mins: As you might expect, things have got a little scrappy. Stuart Dallas reads the room and decides to take the game on all by himself but after galloping 70 metres down the right wing there\u2019s no end product. 75 mins: Leeds are happy to slow the game down a little and let the ball do the work as we near the closing stages but once their methodical build-up reaches Western Sydney\u2019s box the move breaks down and Markus Babbel can bring on a heap more young subs. Pretty much the Wanderers U21 side out there now. 73 mins: Another decent chance for Western Sydney but sub Kosta Grozos just overhits his throughball to Duke and the big striker can\u2019t get a shot away. 72 mins: The goalscorer Yeboah has been subbed off after pulling with cramp. Mohamed Adam is on in his place bringing the number of local youth products on the ground up to five. 71 mins: A rare Wanderers attack forces Casilla into a save from a decent Baccus strike. The young midfielder has been outstanding tonight driving up and down the pitch chasing every opportunity in defence and attack. He was fed by the excellent Duke following tidy work from both wing-backs Kamau and Wilmering. 70 mins: It\u2019s attack vs defence at the moment with Leeds camped in Wanderers territory. There\u2019s plenty of probing and recycling possession but United can\u2019t fashion an opening, even with Western Sydney handing them possession whenever a clearance looks likelier. 68 mins: Sub keeper, the 19-year old Nick Suman, is in action early, palming a fierce drive from Dallas behind for a corner. 67 mins: Lopar\u2019s reward for that moment of brilliance is to be hooked as Markus Babbel begins what\u2019s likely to be a number of substitutions. 66 mins: Lopar with a world class save! But Bamford really should score. Not for the first time tonight Leeds work space down the left, Harrison crosses low in that corridor of uncertainty in front of the keeper but behind the defence and Bamford is there to tap into the near empty net but his shot is just close enough to Lopar to dive low to his right and pull off a thrilling stop. 64 mins: The two Wanderers players to have most caught the eye so far have been Baccus and Duke. Australian sides in friendlies like this are aware they are shop window opportunities and it would be little surprise if there weren\u2019t enquiries for either following tongiht\u2019s showing. 62 mins: Despite their slick football on the ground Leeds are adamant that crosses to Bamford are a productive route to goal. 60 minutes of evidence so far has proven them wrong but they persist and the Wanderers continue to clear with greater comfort than when the ball is played through them on the deck. 60 mins: Baccus has picked a few Leeds United pockets tonight and he does so again to turn defence into attack but Yeboah is too isolated to fashion an opening. 58 mins: More lovely interplay from Leeds, Douglas to the fore first before Hernandez engineers space just inside the box to curl a left-footed effort just over the bar. 56 mins: Nice spell of possession from Leeds, stretching the Wanderers from one flank to the other, but there\u2019s no cutting edge despite the best intentions from Hernandez and Harrison. After an age Western Sydney clear and Duke milks the first yellow card of the night from Bogusz. 53 mins: And Roofe does make way for Jordan Stevens, during a break in play caused by some midfield spite the product of Leeds upping the intensity following that equalising goal. 52 mins: Bad news for Leeds with Kemar Roofe down and receiving treatment. He looks set to be the first substitute of the night. 50 mins: Leeds are almost level three times in the blink of an eye but the ball refuses to go in a second time for the visitors. Hernandez almost dribbled through on his own, Bamford failed to get enough on a header from the edge of the six-yard box, while desperate defending from the Wanderers snuffed out a couple of dangerous crosses. It is a mystery how Leeds are not ahead. Western Sydney are level! Leeds give the ball away cheaply in midfield, Baccus snaffles up possession and strides downfield like Patrick Vieira before releasing Yeboah with a perfectly timed and weighted throughball, the striker neatly dinking the ball beyond Casilla and unfurling an acrobatic celebration. 47 mins: Leeds immediately begin on the front foot and again it\u2019s Harrison down the left flank causing problems for the Wanderers defence. He\u2019s halted in his tracks by a foul from McGowan but the free-kick comes to little and Western Sydney clear but in a pattern established in the first period good work from Duke isn\u2019t honoured by an isolated teammate. 46 mins: Second-half underway between Leeds United and Western Sydney Wanderers. No changes at half-time for either side. Bankwest Stadium lived up to expectation. The noise poured from the stands and through the TV speakers. It just looks and sounds like a proper football stadium. A welcome addition to the Australian sporting scene and a huge incentive for fans to get to Wanderers matches. Clare Lawrence has joined the conversation by email. \u201cFans getting their money\u2019s worth with this game,\u201d she writes. \u201cLeeds should have put more away but WSW looking strong in the final third. Problem is getting to the final third!\u201d It\u2019s part of the problem with a 5-2-3 formation when you don\u2019t see much of the ball, there simply aren\u2019t the bodies in midfield to capitalise on those rare moments of possession. There have also been plenty of skill errors from Baccus, Schewgler and Majewski, the latter pair perhaps forgiven for not yet being on the same wavelength as their new teammates. That brings an entertaining half of football to an end. Leeds clearly the better of the two sides but the Wanderers have had their moments. 45 mins: Sniff of an opportunity for the Wanderers with Majewski striking a 30-yard free-kick around Leeds\u2019 defensive wall but wide of Casilla\u2019s left-hand upright. 43 mins: Another Leeds chance; another change goes begging. This time Hernandez can\u2019t beat Lopar one-on-one after the Spaniard robs the Wanderers in their own half and then sprints to get onto the end of a superbly weighted throughball. 42 mins: Bamford\u2019s turn to fluff his lines, missing from point blank range after another yet more superb wide play from Harrison. Leeds should be out of sight by now. 40 mins: Harrison - the most dangerous player on the field - has to score but after yet again bursting down the inside-left channel he can\u2019t beat Lopar one-on-one, his shot with the outside of his left foot snaking wide of the post. Leeds are well on top now though and after the Wanderers fail to clear Roofe smacks the corner of post and bar, the ball dropping agonisingly the wrong side of the line. 37 mins: First look at Majewski with time and space, the former Poland international carrying the ball towards the edge of the Leeds box but his piledriver is wildly off target. 35 mins: Leeds are in the ascendancy now the game has settled into a rhythm but their hosts continue to look sharp pressurising the first pass out of the defence. They just lack the ability control possession in the middle third to make those interceptions count. 33 mins: Leeds are inches away from 2-0 and it\u2019s Bogusz again, driving low from the edge of the box following a corner but his effort is deflected wide. Harrison then smashes a left-footed effort over the bar. 26 mins: Another sign of Schewgler\u2019s experience, cynically bringing down Harrison on the halfway line to nip a promising counterattack in the bud. In league play that would have been a clear yellow card but Kurt Ams keeps his cards in his pocket for the time being. 25 mins: Chances at both ends! First Leeds piece an attack neatly through the centre of the Wanderers defence but the cutback from the byline is cleared at the second attempt. Western Sydney go straight down the other end but Kamau can\u2019t get enough on his cross-cum-shot to force the ball over the line after beating Casilla. 24 mins: The Wanderers looked callow and rudderless last season but the introductions of McGowan and Schwegler has made an immediate improvement with plenty of pointing and organising keeping Markus Babbel\u2019s structure. 22 mins: Leeds are trying to target Bamford in the air with long diagonals but Mourdoukoutas has been up to the task so far defensively. When United get the ball on the turf they look far more dangerous, especially when it\u2019s anywhere near Harrison. 19 mins: There\u2019s some obvious preseason drills paying dividends for both sides out there, notably a quick couple of close passes followed by the longer forward release. For Leeds this hasn\u2019t been timed like clockwork with a couple of offsides while the Wanderers have often found their target isolated and bullied off the ball. 15 mins: Brilliant from Duke again who\u2019s putting himself about just in front of the Leeds back four. This time his strength and technique feeds Wilmering down the left but his cutback is smuggled clear. This is an open, enterprising game of football played against a stunning backdrop. 13 mins: Wanderers have to score! Superb centre-forward play from Mitch Duke holding the ball up then freeing Kamau down the right. His first-time cross is a belter but as it skips across the six-yard box the onrushing Yeboah can\u2019t get enough on the finish at the ball skims wide when it should have burst the net. 12 mins: After those early Wanderers bursts its been all Leeds, helped in no small part by Western Sydney seeming unable to either clear their lines or retain possession. Leeds take the lead and it\u2019s that combination again for United down the left with Harrison bursting into space on the edge of the penalty area and cutting back for Bogusz to rifle unerringly into the top-corner with a composed first-time strike. Terrific finish. 8 mins: First chance of the night goes to Leeds. Mourdoukoutas made a hash of a clearance and from the crumbs Hernandez pokes the ball towards goal, forcing Lopar into a scrambling save to his left. 6 mins: Leeds are prioritising the left flank with Harrison and Bogusz both seeing plenty of the ball early as the visitors try to exploit space on the fringe of Western Sydney\u2019s back three and force Bruce Kamau into uncomfortable defensive areas. 4 mins: AS the RBB make themselves heard in the stands Keanu Baccus makes himself known on the field, beginning a lovely flowing move that ends with a dangerous cross from the right failing to find a target in the box. 2 mins: The home side have begun on the front foot. An aggressive forward press has already forced a couple of turnovers in dangerous situations but a lack of composure in midfield prevented any chances from emerging. Wanderers get the action underway at a raucous Bankwest Stadium. Leeds will be top to toe in white tonight, Western Sydney in the latest iteration of their black and red hoops. Referee Kurt Ams is wearing yellow. Kick-off imminent. The teams are finally out on the ground and - boy oh boy - what a scene! Bankwest Stadium looks like something out of a top-level European competition. The steep-sided stands, the the noise from the Red and Black Bloc, everything looks tailor made for football. Glorious. Kick-offs are never on time in the A-League so why should friendlies be any different? Still a few minutes away from the game getting underway, time to enjoy this nice little story about Daniel Wilmering. The Wanderers full-back has made the step-up from ball-boy to first-teamer in a brief seven years. Despite the distance between the West Riding of Yorkshire and the western suburbs of Sydney this isn\u2019t the first time some of these players and officials have come up against each other. For example, Wanderers debutant and former Poland international Radoslaw Majewski enjoyed a fine run out against Leeds United during his spell at Nottingham Forest. Wanderers fans seem impressed with their new digs. Markus Babbel used his prematch press conference to assert that his Wanderers would not take a defensive mindset into tonight\u2019s friendly. \u201cWe want to show what we can do. We definitely are not parking a coach in the box,\u201d Babbel said. \u201cWe will try also to play football and hopefully we can see a good game.\u201d Those comments arrived a few days after Perth Glory camped on the edge of their own penalty area against Manchester United in the first marquee friendly of the preseason between Australian and English sides. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a special situation because it\u2019s the first game at home, our new home, and also against a European side, Leeds United, a big club. It\u2019s fantastic.\u201d There are four new faces along the Wanderers spine with Pirmin Schwegler, Daniel Lopar, Dylan McGowan and Radoslaw Majewski all handed debuts. It looks a much stronger line-up that the one that struggled through last season and with Daniel Georgievski, Patrick Ziegler and Jordan O\u2019Doherty all missing the matchday squad, not to mention a bunch of the most promising kids in the country, there is plenty to be optimistic about in Wanderland. Marcelo Bielsa only brought 16 players with him to Australia so all should feature at some point tonight. Adam Forshaw picked up a knock against Man Utd and doesn\u2019t start but another player under an injury cloud, Northern Ireland international Stuart Dallas, does line-up in the first XI. It will be interesting to see how Leeds operate as the favoured side following their underdog status in Perth. Jack Harrison caught the eye the other night and should prove a handful for the Wanderers defence. Leeds United are well supported in Australia and it\u2019s no surprise. Aside from the storied history that attracts overseas admirers Leeds have welcomed a long line of Australians to Elland Road, headlined of course by Harry Kewell and Mark Viduka but including the likes of Paul Okon, Jacob Burns, Neil Kilkenny and Patrick Kisnorbo.

One nation will draw on the accumulated knowhow of a thousand Tests; the other, only two. Then again, wouldn\u2019t it be just like England to win the World Cup at Lord\u2019s one week and lose to a bunch of relative novices there the next? The match, which starts on Wednesday, ought to be a gentle warmup for the Ashes. Except that warmups have a way of biting big names on the backside. Lord\u2019s is just down the road from Kilburn, a traditional Irish stronghold that will surely send some of its sons and daughters along to scoff at the English. If they fancy a flutter, an Irish victory is a tempting 25-1. Ireland have already given England a scare once this summer, when Ben Foakes and Tom Curran had to mount a salvage operation in an ODI at Malahide. And it was not so long ago that Ireland left England red-faced in the World Cup. At Bengaluru in 2011 Andrew Strauss\u2019s England batted perfectly well, making 327, only to let Kevin O\u2019Brien turn a lost cause into the highest successful run chase in World Cup history.

The other was riddled with bullets outside his home; Camilo found the body, but never discovered who was responsible. \u201cThe war hit us hard here, it killed our communities, extorted people and forced us from our homes,\u201d said P\u00e9rez, who asked to use a pseudonym after receiving death threats. A 2016 deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Farc, was supposed to put an end to five decades of bitter conflict that killed at least 260,000 people and forced 7 million from their homes. But with the ink long dry on the deal, many Colombians are discovering that little has changed. In the vast and lawless Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela, armed men and women still roam the villages, imposing nightly curfews, handing out threatening pamphlets and regularly exchanging gunfire.

About a third of Farc combatants are believed to have taken up arms again: some claim that the government has not held up its end of the bargain; others simply recognize that there is more money to be made in drug trafficking, extortion and illegal mining. After the peace deal, another rebel group, the National Liberation Army (or ELN), stepped into the power vacuum left by the Farc, and is now taking advantage of turmoil in Venezuela to expand as far as Guyana. Venezuela\u2019s embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, sees the ELN as kindred ideological spirits and turns a blind eye to criminal activities in the countryside. Yet another faction \u2013 the Popular Liberation Army (or EPL) \u2013 has long held out in Catatumbo and is now in open warfare with the ELN and Farc dissidents. P\u00e9rez has come to Oca\u00f1a, the chaotic city at Catatumbo\u2019s western frontier, to update humanitarian organisations on the situation back home in the village of Otar\u00e9.

      "bodyText": "Georgian Bath was built within a century, and a lot of it disappeared inside a decade \u2013 the 1960s \u2013 when I was born. Calton Road and many rows of listed buildings were still coming down when I was learning to walk, and the Ballance Street flats going up, but the Brussellisation of the city was something I grew to love, something I associate with the freedom to roam I enjoyed as a kid. Bath always had a violent side, but my parents weren\u2019t overprotective. I walked to Beechen Cliff comp every day with my friend Rachid, and the route took us through all the architectural ages of man \u2013 the Corn Market, the Roman baths, the abbey, Southgate shopping centre (demolished 20 years ago) and, in the shadow of the cliff itself, the \u201chencoop\u201d houses of Holloway, which architectural historians sneered at, but where other friends lived happily. The city and the school were a hodgepodge of styles, classes, backgrounds, accents and goings-on. Beechen Cliff was very big when I joined it in 1978. The Wells Road site was the old secondary modern, a combination of railway sheds unfit for habitation and imposing Victorian buildings with parquet floors. And a proper toolshop \u2013 I was weirdly good at metalwork. The Alexandra Park site, where I could look out of the window while reading Persuasion and imagine Anne Elliot going for a walk, occupied the grounds of the former City of Bath Boys\u2019 school. I found school quite frightening, because I was small and my voice, infuriatingly, refused to break. But I could be funny, and when the nightly genital inspection revealed my first pube I knew I was going to be all right. Sixth form made me.

His dozen new pieces for <em>Tao</em> share many of the characteristics we expect \u2013 tightly clustered patterns, shifting and returning \u2013 but in some, such as The River, a lyrical melody breaks free, sent on its way by the golden playing of <a href=\"https://manchestercollective.co.uk/news/2019/1/16/feature-meet-the-artist-rakhi-singh\" title=\"\">violinist Rakhi Singh</a>. This serenity has darker echoes in the spare single lines that make up Coma, a musical evocation of deep consciousness, performed by Glass in absentia, on a piano adapted to record and play back exactly the impressions of his fingers on the keyboard.

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d.

The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>.

For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2005, one of the strongest tornadoes ever recorded in the UK hit Birmingham, carving a 4-mile path of destruction through the suburbs of the city and leaving 19 people injured.</p> \n<p>Heavy rain is expected across western Scotland on Sunday, which may lead to some localised flooding and travel disruption, according to the Met Office.

These cases that have been brought to our attention \u2013 whether it is playgrounds or the concept of a poor door \u2013 where your access to a building is determined by your ownership, this cannot be right.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to ensure planning and national rules that are there are properly upheld and understood.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners say the new policy has not fully resolved the problem because it will have no impact on estates that have already been built or are in development.</p> <p>In March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/30/we-just-play-in-the-carpark-more-segregated-playgrounds-revealed\">people across the UK</a> reported segregation on their estates.</p> <p>In Greenwich, families in social and affordable housing on the Seren Park Gardens estate failed to gain access to a gated podium play space.</p> <p>This week, Emma, who lives in social rented accommodation and has three children, was bringing two toddlers out to play in the car park, 100 metres from the locked playground.</p> <p>Emma and her neighbours feel that the affordable homes were built to meet a target but then put in a separate building so they wouldn\u2019t have to be given access to communal spaces.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe are the 20% affordable, aren\u2019t we? They\u2019ve just shoved us all in one block and given us nothing. It would be nice if there was somewhere to meet our neighbours, somewhere all the children could play together.\u201d</p> <p>To get permission to build, developers must provide a certain percentage of affordable homes. All the accommodation in the block that does not have playground access is classed as affordable. The first five floors are social housing and the rest shared ownership, with buyers paying reduced rent to the housing association, Moat Homes.</p> <p>Emma\u2019s neighbour Rachael, who brings her five-year-old and one-year-old out to play on their scooters among the cars, said the residents felt discriminated against. She said: \u201cIf that is their playground, then where is ours?\u201d</p> <p>Moat Homes said: \u201cThey are separate developments and all residents \u2026 have access to the amenities within their particular developments.\u201d However, marketing and sales material describes the blocks as forming a single development and documents promising a play area as part of planning permission.</p> <p>Alan Camp Architects, who won an Evening Standard award for best large mixed-tenure development for their involvement in the site, refused to comment. Cllr Sizwe James, cabinet member for growth and strategic development at Greenwich council, said councils did not have enough power to force access.</p> <p>James said: \u201cWhen the development plans were submitted, the developer did not indicate that the amenity areas would be segregated, nor a gate placed at the entrance to the communal garden with fob access. We are very disappointed that residents are being excluded \u2026 however, we do not have any powers to force the developers to allow them access.\u201d</p>",

He said developers and housing associations should open spaces up in estates that are currently segregated. \u201cMy call to anyone who is managing or owns a building of this kind is: change the arrangements if there is a sense of segregation,\u201d he said. There was outrage across the political spectrum earlier this year at the case of the Lilian Baylis estate in Kennington. Guardian Cities reported that families living in the social housing side of the estate were not allowed to use the play area or any communal spaces on the development. On Friday the Guardian revealed that that the new London plan, which sets out how developers and local authorities can plan new housing, will outlaw any segregation by tenure. Under the new policy developments, where there are a mix of tenures \u2013 private owners alongside \u201caffordable\u201d housing including shared ownership and social rented accommodation \u2013 developers will no longer be allowed to build play areas that are accessible only to people in the most expensive properties. Brokenshire told the BBC he wants to end all forms of segregation in housing. \u201cIt is very firmly my position that we should not have this sense of stigma and segregation because of the nature of the home you live in. These cases that have been brought to our attention \u2013 whether it is playgrounds or the concept of a poor door \u2013 where your access to a building is determined by your ownership, this cannot be right. \u201cWe need to ensure planning and national rules that are there are properly upheld and understood.\u201d Campaigners say the new policy has not fully resolved the problem because it will have no impact on estates that have already been built or are in development. In March people across the UK reported segregation on their estates. In Greenwich, families in social and affordable housing on the Seren Park Gardens estate failed to gain access to a gated podium play space. This week, Emma, who lives in social rented accommodation and has three children, was bringing two toddlers out to play in the car park, 100 metres from the locked playground. Emma and her neighbours feel that the affordable homes were built to meet a target but then put in a separate building so they wouldn\u2019t have to be given access to communal spaces. She said: \u201cWe are the 20% affordable, aren\u2019t we? They\u2019ve just shoved us all in one block and given us nothing. It would be nice if there was somewhere to meet our neighbours, somewhere all the children could play together.\u201d To get permission to build, developers must provide a certain percentage of affordable homes. All the accommodation in the block that does not have playground access is classed as affordable. The first five floors are social housing and the rest shared ownership, with buyers paying reduced rent to the housing association, Moat Homes. Emma\u2019s neighbour Rachael, who brings her five-year-old and one-year-old out to play on their scooters among the cars, said the residents felt discriminated against. She said: \u201cIf that is their playground, then where is ours?\u201d Moat Homes said: \u201cThey are separate developments and all residents \u2026 have access to the amenities within their particular developments.\u201d However, marketing and sales material describes the blocks as forming a single development and documents promising a play area as part of planning permission. Alan Camp Architects, who won an Evening Standard award for best large mixed-tenure development for their involvement in the site, refused to comment. Cllr Sizwe James, cabinet member for growth and strategic development at Greenwich council, said councils did not have enough power to force access. James said: \u201cWhen the development plans were submitted, the developer did not indicate that the amenity areas would be segregated, nor a gate placed at the entrance to the communal garden with fob access. We are very disappointed that residents are being excluded \u2026 however, we do not have any powers to force the developers to allow them access.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At the Luna food factory on the south-east outskirts of Jeddah, Mashael Elghamdi sits at her computer in an artfully ripped AC/DC T-shirt and jeans. The faint whirr of machines processing cans of beans, cream and evaporated milk can be heard over the sound of eight women typing and sometimes laughing. A screensaver of a smiling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/camerondiaz\" title=\"\">Cameron Diaz</a> gazes out from one corner of the room. This is an all-female office. And because there is no need for the full-length abayas women are legally required to wear when interacting with men at work or in public, it is a riot of colour.</p> <p>On the factory floor below, women in custom-made overalls on an all-female production line apply labels to cans. \u201cAll the women you see here do everything themselves,\u201d says supervisor Fatima Albasisi, who oversees 90 workers. A staircase and a corridor separate the female factory workers from their male counterparts, while the men-only offices are in a different building. \u201cIf there\u2019s a problem with the machines, they can fix it,\u201d Albasisi adds. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d have a factory entirely run by women, no men at all. In my experience, women show up to work on time and make fewer mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>The Luna food factory has been segregated since women began working as administrators here eight years ago. On the factory floor, the first 40 women started in 2013. \u201cWe work harder than the men,\u201d Elghamdi tells me, back in the office. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s better to be separate. If we work with the men, I have to wear my abaya and my niqab \u2013 it\u2019s less comfortable.\u201d She works in data entry, but also oversees worker safety for women. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for them to tell me what they need,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go to the men.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Not all offices or factories in Saudi Arabia are gender-segregated; it hasn\u2019t been a legal requirement since 2005. But many employers continue to separate the sexes, to balance the conservative values of a majority-male workforce with the country\u2019s apparent desire to get more women into work. As the physical barriers come down in other social settings, women-only workspaces are a symbol of both the future and the past; the question of whether they are a necessary step towards full female participation remains a murky one.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The kingdom wants a workforce that is 30% female. At the same time, it has cracked down on women\u2019s rights activists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Saudi women have long worked, but in very limited numbers. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2sYyeff\" title=\"\">According to the World Bank</a>, women\u2019s share of the labour force increased less than 7% between 1990 and 2018, now accounting for 16.8% of total workers. Saudi Arabia\u2019s own estimates put this figure higher, at 22%.</p> <p>Saudi officials have promised to overhaul the economy, weaning it off its dependence on oil, which accounts for <a href=\"https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/169.htm\" title=\"\">an estimated 50%</a> of gross domestic product. Key to this is a pledge to boost domestic employment and, in particular, the percentage of women, which it wants to reach 30% by 2030. Last year, the kingdom outlined \u201csteps towards women\u2019s full participation in society\u201d, such as allowing them to attend sports matches.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.the-saudi.net/business-center/labor_law.htm\" title=\"\">Saudi law specifies</a> that women may work only in \u201cfields suitable to their nature\u201d and prohibits them from jobs considered \u201cdetrimental to health\u201d or \u201clikely to expose women to specific risks\u201d. In practice, these opaque rules are often interpreted by employers as a means of banning women from anything physically challenging. (At the Luna factory, tasks such as moving heavy boxes are restricted to the men\u2019s section.) A Women in the Workplace initiative, launched in January, requires that women be given separate spaces to work if they ask for them; prevents women from being left alone with male colleagues; and mandates that women can work as cleaners or in room service only at all-female hotels or resorts.</p> <p>If Saudi officials are to be believed, greater reforms are on the horizon. Recent changes \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/24/saudi-arabia-women-celebrate-as-driving-ban-lifted\" title=\"\">repealing a ban on women driving</a> \u2013 are intended to signify the kingdom\u2019s readiness to modernise. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/18/saudi-arabia-move-curb-religious-police-abuses-0\" title=\"\">A 2016 directive</a> also cut the power of the religious police, the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, who once watched over women\u2019s behaviour in public: they are now unable to arrest women for crimes such as mixing with men who are not family members, or to <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/saudi-religious-police-berate-gloveless-woman-180512611.html\" title=\"\">berate them for showing their bare hands</a>. The contrasts can be jarring: a Nicki Minaj concert originally scheduled for this month in Jeddah drew the ire of Saudi women, angry at Minaj being able to perform \u2013 \u201cto go and shake her ass\u2026 and then you tell me to go and wear the abaya\u201d, one Saudi woman said in a video posted to Twitter, viewed more than 37,000 times. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/09/nicki-minaj-pulls-out-of-saudi-arabia-concert-after-backlash\" title=\"\">Minaj has since cancelled</a> her appearance, citing her support \u201cfor the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd9cdaf78a1730e020598bf44b91f1a068cd5771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd9cdaf78a1730e020598bf44b91f1a068cd5771/0_428_6417_3850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olfat Zareef (on right), product and marketing research manager at Luna foods in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women are making progress at companies such as Luna foods, where Olfat Zareef (on right) is product and marketing research manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasneem Alsultan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Prince <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">Mohammed bin Salman</a>, heir to the throne and de facto ruler, known as MBS, women\u2019s participation is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/i-will-return-saudi-arabia-moderate-islam-crown-prince\" title=\"\">embodiment of a new Saudi Arabia</a>. The murder of journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\" title=\"\">Jamal Khashoggi </a>last year, and the subsequent cover-up, may have combusted much of the kingdom\u2019s carefully crafted image on the international stage. But MBS remains powerful, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/16/cia-determines-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-journalists-killing-washington-post\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/16/cia-determines-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-journalists-killing-washington-post\" title=\"\">CIA\u2019s assessment</a> that he personally ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing. His mantra of change filters down from on high; everyone I speak to, from street vendors to government officials, tells me, \u201cThings are different now.\u201d They may not always be speaking freely \u2013 a female minder accompanies me on official appointments.</p> <p>This is a country where society is shifting far more slowly than the official rhetoric. While the Women in the Workplace initiative demands equal pay for equal work, a hefty pay gap remains. Saudi women are paid, on average, 56% less than men; the kingdom ranked 145th out of 149 countries in <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2EtO7hO\" title=\"\">last year\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index</a>.</p> <p>Long before Khashoggi\u2019s murder, there were brutal efforts to silence critics or anyone pushing for deeper reforms. <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/saudi-arabia/\" title=\"\">According to Amnesty International</a>, 104 people have been executed this year. The kingdom has conducted \u201can unprecedented crackdown on the women\u2019s rights movement\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/20/saudi-arabia-unrelenting-crackdown-activists\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch says</a> \u2013 last year arresting and prosecuting 11 women who pushed for the right to drive before it was legal, or simply spoke out against laws restricting women. According to human rights groups and their families, the women were subjected to brutal torture, including waterboarding and electric shocks. Seven have been bailed this year; all await sentencing for \u201ccoordinated activity to undermine the security, stability and social peace of the kingdom\u201d.</p> <p>Against this background, women-only spaces are a powerful visual signifier of change, positioning women as symbols of the new Saudi Arabia. But what do they mean to the women themselves, caught between the state\u2019s promises and their own daily struggles to navigate a conservative society?</p> <p>***</p> <p>An hour north of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast, diggers churn the sandy earth on a flat, barren plain beneath an unforgiving midday sun. There is little more to see than the sparkling turquoise-tinted glass of an empty administrative office, but the site is touted as the future of female employment in the kingdom, an \u201coasis\u201d designed for women. The complex will include 48 factories producing medical supplies, food and technology.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia\u2019s Industrial Property Authority, or <a href=\"https://www.modon.gov.sa/en/IndustrialCities/IndustrialCitiesDirectory/Oasis/Pages/Ahsa3rd.aspx\" title=\"\">Modon</a>, originally raised the idea of industrial parks exclusively for women in 2012, when it announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/saudi-arabia-city-women-workers\" title=\"\">the development of a \u201cwomen-only city\u201d</a> in Al-Ahsa, east of the capital, Riyadh. This \u201coasis\u201d, it said, was designed \u201cfor women workers in [an] environment and working conditions consistent with the privacy of women according to Islamic guidelines and regulations\u201d. In 2015, Modon announced a further four similar sites across the country. Little is publicly known about the success or conditions of the first; Modon resists my efforts to visit or speak to women working there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"736264aa9fbc7e1cd9a5e201574dd918bb5c1e81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/736264aa9fbc7e1cd9a5e201574dd918bb5c1e81/2482_891_4067_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An industrial park\u00a0in Saudi Arabia built to provide women-\u00adonly workplaces\" width=\"1000\" height=\"453\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An industrial park built to provide women-\u00adonly workplaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasneem Alsultan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time construction had begun near the more progressive city of Jeddah, the government rhetoric around women\u2019s rights and \u201cprivacy\u201d had shifted. The Jeddah \u201coasis\u201d will be \u201can environment that will encourage women to work\u201d, but one where men will also be permitted, says Bandar Al-Toaimi, Modon\u2019s communications director, gesturing at the open space as we tour the site. He says any decisions about features that could attract female workers, such as segregation, are \u201cup to the ministry of labour\u2019s rules and regulations\u201d. Have any women been consulted about the design? Toaimi says he will check with the project department, but does not respond to follow-up emails. After months of detailed negotiations about my visit, I expected to see a 5 million sq m site, the foundation of a metropolis. But the complex is little more than a network of roads connecting piles of sand.</p> <p>Toaimi argues that the industrial park will be \u201ca big enabler in the recruitment of females in Saudi Arabia\u201d, as our four-wheel drive speeds along freshly built roads. Like al-Ahsa oasis, the Jeddah complex will feature a nursery and, potentially, a bus to help women get to work \u2013 though Toaimi adds dismissively that \u201ctransportation now is not an issue \u2013 women can drive\u201d. Exactly how many isn\u2019t clear: I fail to spot any female drivers in Riyadh or Jeddah when I visit, although a few women tell me they have obtained their licences and are cautiously starting to drive. In the months that follow, Saudi women say driving is starting to become the norm.</p> <p>Toaimi is upbeat about international investment but light on the details as he points out a cluster of shuttered grey factories around empty parking spaces. \u201cWe will give incentives to encourage investors to come \u2013 and ensure they have a good number of women working there. Maybe even a full facility,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This might be welcome news to some foreign executives, such as Tim Cook of Apple, who last year <a href=\"https://www.arabianbusiness.com/retail/393740-apple-pushed-for-mixed-gender-workplaces-in-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">requested reassurances</a> from Saudi authorities that, should they invest in the kingdom, they would be spared prosecution for setting up mixed-gender workplaces. Apple opened its first shop in Riyadh\u2019s King Khalid airport last July, but any suggestion of a wider rollout has stalled. Saudi officials hope the tech giant will eventually join companies such as <a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/news/news-and-features/Feature-article/2017/saudi-factory-makes-a-huge-leap-for-gender-diversity.html\" title=\"\">Unilever</a> and Johnson &amp; Johnson, who operate in the kingdom. The crown prince, MBS, has also courted Amazon to build data centres, but foreign companies have been hesitant to announce projects in Saudi Arabia since the Khashoggi murder. The <a href=\"https://bit.ly/30tZP3B\" title=\"\">Riyadh Chamber of Commerce</a> says companies that choose to set up in the Jeddah oasis will benefit from longer leases and preferential government loans as a reward for hiring more women. But the details are vague: Toaimi can\u2019t tell me how many women a business would need to hire in order to qualify. (Months later, I am told that companies will have to ensure at least 50% of their \u201cmanpower\u201d comes from women \u2013 but it is unclear what sanctions, if any, those that fail to do so will face.)</p> <p>***</p> <p>The global trend for women-only spaces such as the US co-working startup <a href=\"https://www.the-wing.com/\" title=\"\">the Wing</a>, which recently expanded to London, women-only <a href=\"https://www.japan-experience.com/to-know/visiting-japan/women-only-cars-in-trains\" title=\"\">train carriages in Japan</a> and a <a href=\"https://supershe.com/island/\" title=\"\">networking retreat in Finland</a> might sometimes create a sense that the world is catching up with Saudi Arabia. But while gender-segregated offices proliferate there, few can claim to be founded by women for women. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bbc9fa6f7fb88a0b298a046cc9a051994fb135a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bbc9fa6f7fb88a0b298a046cc9a051994fb135a/0_642_6086_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SheWorks in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, a women-only workspace where would-be businesswomen can seek advice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s sort of a club vibe to it\u2019: SheWorks in Riyadh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasneem Alsultan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the offices of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/30ptevU\" title=\"\">SheWorks</a>, Riyadh\u2019s sole women-only co-working space, women work on business plans from hot pink office chairs, or perch on mauve sofas, bright against the dusty cityscape outside. If men visit for meetings or training sessions, they enter via a separate door to one of the walled-off meeting rooms behind frosted windows. The office sits atop a nursery, where women can leave their children while they work. \u201cI picked this building specifically because there is daycare downstairs,\u201d says founder <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mahashirah/\" title=\"\">Maha Shirah</a>, who opened SheWorks in late 2014.</p> <p>Shirah says SheWorks was a response to her own experiences in banking and hospital administration, where women from more conservative families were uncomfortable \u201ctalking to strange men\u201d. Today, SheWorks functions as both a co-working space and an advisory service for women who are navigating the complexities of Saudi bureaucracy in order to start their own businesses. Women account for <a href=\"http://www.gulf-insider.com/saudi-female-entrepreneurs-increase-35-10-years-report/\" title=\"\">roughly 39%</a> of all entrepreneurs in the country \u2013 higher than in other sectors because wealthy women often opt to set up their own business rather than work in fields dominated by men.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a club vibe to it,\u201d Shirah says of the space, looking at a nearby group clustered round a laptop. She adds that SheWorks hinges on the professional networks women build there, choosing to segregate themselves rather than being told to. \u201cI decided to make this a women-only space because my customers wanted that,\u201d she says, adding that she would change it if they wanted to admit men. SheWorks offers a relaxed environment where women can remove their abayas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ad2353fd49ec08c0582d5c8ff80519186e06fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ad2353fd49ec08c0582d5c8ff80519186e06fd6/0_639_6604_3764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women in the family section of a restaurant in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women in the \u2018family\u2019 section of a Riyadh restaurant, separated from tables for \u2018singles\u2019, meaning men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasneem Alsultan/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shirah scoffs at the promises of privacy or protection that often accompany gender-segregated workplaces. \u201cI don\u2019t want privacy to be forced on me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like when you force me not to drive.

      "bodyText": "At the Luna food factory on the south-east outskirts of Jeddah, Mashael Elghamdi sits at her computer in an artfully ripped AC/DC T-shirt and jeans. The faint whirr of machines processing cans of beans, cream and evaporated milk can be heard over the sound of eight women typing and sometimes laughing. A screensaver of a smiling Cameron Diaz gazes out from one corner of the room. This is an all-female office. And because there is no need for the full-length abayas women are legally required to wear when interacting with men at work or in public, it is a riot of colour. On the factory floor below, women in custom-made overalls on an all-female production line apply labels to cans. \u201cAll the women you see here do everything themselves,\u201d says supervisor Fatima Albasisi, who oversees 90 workers. A staircase and a corridor separate the female factory workers from their male counterparts, while the men-only offices are in a different building. \u201cIf there\u2019s a problem with the machines, they can fix it,\u201d Albasisi adds. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d have a factory entirely run by women, no men at all. In my experience, women show up to work on time and make fewer mistakes.\u201d The Luna food factory has been segregated since women began working as administrators here eight years ago. On the factory floor, the first 40 women started in 2013. \u201cWe work harder than the men,\u201d Elghamdi tells me, back in the office. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s better to be separate. If we work with the men, I have to wear my abaya and my niqab \u2013 it\u2019s less comfortable.\u201d She works in data entry, but also oversees worker safety for women. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for them to tell me what they need,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go to the men.\u201d *** Not all offices or factories in Saudi Arabia are gender-segregated; it hasn\u2019t been a legal requirement since 2005. But many employers continue to separate the sexes, to balance the conservative values of a majority-male workforce with the country\u2019s apparent desire to get more women into work. As the physical barriers come down in other social settings, women-only workspaces are a symbol of both the future and the past; the question of whether they are a necessary step towards full female participation remains a murky one. Saudi women have long worked, but in very limited numbers. According to the World Bank, women\u2019s share of the labour force increased less than 7% between 1990 and 2018, now accounting for 16.8% of total workers. Saudi Arabia\u2019s own estimates put this figure higher, at 22%. Saudi officials have promised to overhaul the economy, weaning it off its dependence on oil, which accounts for an estimated 50% of gross domestic product. Key to this is a pledge to boost domestic employment and, in particular, the percentage of women, which it wants to reach 30% by 2030. Last year, the kingdom outlined \u201csteps towards women\u2019s full participation in society\u201d, such as allowing them to attend sports matches. Saudi law specifies that women may work only in \u201cfields suitable to their nature\u201d and prohibits them from jobs considered \u201cdetrimental to health\u201d or \u201clikely to expose women to specific risks\u201d. In practice, these opaque rules are often interpreted by employers as a means of banning women from anything physically challenging. (At the Luna factory, tasks such as moving heavy boxes are restricted to the men\u2019s section.) A Women in the Workplace initiative, launched in January, requires that women be given separate spaces to work if they ask for them; prevents women from being left alone with male colleagues; and mandates that women can work as cleaners or in room service only at all-female hotels or resorts. If Saudi officials are to be believed, greater reforms are on the horizon. Recent changes \u2013 such as repealing a ban on women driving \u2013 are intended to signify the kingdom\u2019s readiness to modernise. A 2016 directive also cut the power of the religious police, the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, who once watched over women\u2019s behaviour in public: they are now unable to arrest women for crimes such as mixing with men who are not family members, or to berate them for showing their bare hands. The contrasts can be jarring: a Nicki Minaj concert originally scheduled for this month in Jeddah drew the ire of Saudi women, angry at Minaj being able to perform \u2013 \u201cto go and shake her ass\u2026 and then you tell me to go and wear the abaya\u201d, one Saudi woman said in a video posted to Twitter, viewed more than 37,000 times. Minaj has since cancelled her appearance, citing her support \u201cfor the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression\u201d. For Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir to the throne and de facto ruler, known as MBS, women\u2019s participation is the embodiment of a new Saudi Arabia. The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, and the subsequent cover-up, may have combusted much of the kingdom\u2019s carefully crafted image on the international stage. But MBS remains powerful, despite the CIA\u2019s assessment that he personally ordered Khashoggi\u2019s killing. His mantra of change filters down from on high; everyone I speak to, from street vendors to government officials, tells me, \u201cThings are different now.\u201d They may not always be speaking freely \u2013 a female minder accompanies me on official appointments. This is a country where society is shifting far more slowly than the official rhetoric. While the Women in the Workplace initiative demands equal pay for equal work, a hefty pay gap remains. Saudi women are paid, on average, 56% less than men; the kingdom ranked 145th out of 149 countries in last year\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index. Long before Khashoggi\u2019s murder, there were brutal efforts to silence critics or anyone pushing for deeper reforms. According to Amnesty International, 104 people have been executed this year. The kingdom has conducted \u201can unprecedented crackdown on the women\u2019s rights movement\u201d, Human Rights Watch says \u2013 last year arresting and prosecuting 11 women who pushed for the right to drive before it was legal, or simply spoke out against laws restricting women. According to human rights groups and their families, the women were subjected to brutal torture, including waterboarding and electric shocks. Seven have been bailed this year; all await sentencing for \u201ccoordinated activity to undermine the security, stability and social peace of the kingdom\u201d. Against this background, women-only spaces are a powerful visual signifier of change, positioning women as symbols of the new Saudi Arabia. But what do they mean to the women themselves, caught between the state\u2019s promises and their own daily struggles to navigate a conservative society? *** An hour north of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast, diggers churn the sandy earth on a flat, barren plain beneath an unforgiving midday sun. There is little more to see than the sparkling turquoise-tinted glass of an empty administrative office, but the site is touted as the future of female employment in the kingdom, an \u201coasis\u201d designed for women. The complex will include 48 factories producing medical supplies, food and technology. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Industrial Property Authority, or Modon, originally raised the idea of industrial parks exclusively for women in 2012, when it announced the development of a \u201cwomen-only city\u201d in Al-Ahsa, east of the capital, Riyadh. This \u201coasis\u201d, it said, was designed \u201cfor women workers in [an] environment and working conditions consistent with the privacy of women according to Islamic guidelines and regulations\u201d. In 2015, Modon announced a further four similar sites across the country. Little is publicly known about the success or conditions of the first; Modon resists my efforts to visit or speak to women working there. By the time construction had begun near the more progressive city of Jeddah, the government rhetoric around women\u2019s rights and \u201cprivacy\u201d had shifted. The Jeddah \u201coasis\u201d will be \u201can environment that will encourage women to work\u201d, but one where men will also be permitted, says Bandar Al-Toaimi, Modon\u2019s communications director, gesturing at the open space as we tour the site. He says any decisions about features that could attract female workers, such as segregation, are \u201cup to the ministry of labour\u2019s rules and regulations\u201d. Have any women been consulted about the design? Toaimi says he will check with the project department, but does not respond to follow-up emails. After months of detailed negotiations about my visit, I expected to see a 5 million sq m site, the foundation of a metropolis. But the complex is little more than a network of roads connecting piles of sand. Toaimi argues that the industrial park will be \u201ca big enabler in the recruitment of females in Saudi Arabia\u201d, as our four-wheel drive speeds along freshly built roads. Like al-Ahsa oasis, the Jeddah complex will feature a nursery and, potentially, a bus to help women get to work \u2013 though Toaimi adds dismissively that \u201ctransportation now is not an issue \u2013 women can drive\u201d. Exactly how many isn\u2019t clear: I fail to spot any female drivers in Riyadh or Jeddah when I visit, although a few women tell me they have obtained their licences and are cautiously starting to drive. In the months that follow, Saudi women say driving is starting to become the norm. Toaimi is upbeat about international investment but light on the details as he points out a cluster of shuttered grey factories around empty parking spaces. \u201cWe will give incentives to encourage investors to come \u2013 and ensure they have a good number of women working there. Maybe even a full facility,\u201d he says. This might be welcome news to some foreign executives, such as Tim Cook of Apple, who last year requested reassurances from Saudi authorities that, should they invest in the kingdom, they would be spared prosecution for setting up mixed-gender workplaces. Apple opened its first shop in Riyadh\u2019s King Khalid airport last July, but any suggestion of a wider rollout has stalled. Saudi officials hope the tech giant will eventually join companies such as Unilever and Johnson &amp; Johnson, who operate in the kingdom. The crown prince, MBS, has also courted Amazon to build data centres, but foreign companies have been hesitant to announce projects in Saudi Arabia since the Khashoggi murder. The Riyadh Chamber of Commerce says companies that choose to set up in the Jeddah oasis will benefit from longer leases and preferential government loans as a reward for hiring more women. But the details are vague: Toaimi can\u2019t tell me how many women a business would need to hire in order to qualify. (Months later, I am told that companies will have to ensure at least 50% of their \u201cmanpower\u201d comes from women \u2013 but it is unclear what sanctions, if any, those that fail to do so will face.) *** The global trend for women-only spaces such as the US co-working startup the Wing, which recently expanded to London, women-only train carriages in Japan and a networking retreat in Finland might sometimes create a sense that the world is catching up with Saudi Arabia. But while gender-segregated offices proliferate there, few can claim to be founded by women for women. In the offices of SheWorks, Riyadh\u2019s sole women-only co-working space, women work on business plans from hot pink office chairs, or perch on mauve sofas, bright against the dusty cityscape outside. If men visit for meetings or training sessions, they enter via a separate door to one of the walled-off meeting rooms behind frosted windows. The office sits atop a nursery, where women can leave their children while they work. \u201cI picked this building specifically because there is daycare downstairs,\u201d says founder Maha Shirah, who opened SheWorks in late 2014. Shirah says SheWorks was a response to her own experiences in banking and hospital administration, where women from more conservative families were uncomfortable \u201ctalking to strange men\u201d. Today, SheWorks functions as both a co-working space and an advisory service for women who are navigating the complexities of Saudi bureaucracy in order to start their own businesses. Women account for roughly 39% of all entrepreneurs in the country \u2013 higher than in other sectors because wealthy women often opt to set up their own business rather than work in fields dominated by men. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a club vibe to it,\u201d Shirah says of the space, looking at a nearby group clustered round a laptop. She adds that SheWorks hinges on the professional networks women build there, choosing to segregate themselves rather than being told to. \u201cI decided to make this a women-only space because my customers wanted that,\u201d she says, adding that she would change it if they wanted to admit men. SheWorks offers a relaxed environment where women can remove their abayas. Shirah scoffs at the promises of privacy or protection that often accompany gender-segregated workplaces. \u201cI don\u2019t want privacy to be forced on me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like when you force me not to drive. No, I want to have the option. And this is what all women want in the world.\u201d But women creating spaces to suit their own needs depends on increasing the number of female architects, a challenge in a country where women were prevented from studying the subject for decades, until 2011. Even now, \u201ca lot of women graduating in architecture or interior design don\u2019t have jobs,\u201d says Haifa Al-Hababi, assistant professor of architecture at Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. Al-Hababi estimates that up to 15 women have government architecture positions, which she hopes will help increase wages and participation across the industry. She is positive about the knock-on effects of the recent reforms. \u201cBefore, you couldn\u2019t spot any women walking along the street,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you saw this, you\u2019d have thought you were dreaming. Now, you see a lot of women using public space.\u201d *** Gender segregation took hold in Saudi Arabia as part of a wave of conservatism that spread across the Middle East in the 80s, after Iran\u2019s Islamic revolution. For many, separation begins at a young age: all public schools are single sex, as are many universities, some of which beam lectures given by male professors into halls of female students by video link, or keep female students apart from their male peers on a mezzanine floor. Education for women didn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia until 1956 and, while women now make up more than 50% of university students, decades of de facto bans have influenced what they study. Until 2002, the body governing women\u2019s education was still overseen by religious clerics who viewed it as training for motherhood. Subjects such as law and engineering were opened up to women in 2005 and 2011 respectively. It took even longer for pioneering graduates to get permission to work in their chosen fields: Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female lawyer was finally allowed to practise in 2013. Although women make up 30 seats on the 150-member government advisory body, the Shura Council, and the country recently appointed its first female ambassador, such women are the exception and not the rule. Saudi women are still legally classified as minors for their entire lives, under the guardianship system that entitles their husband or male relative to make decisions about matters such as travel on their behalf. Recent reforms mean women no longer need a guardian\u2019s permission to start a business or open a bank account. In public places, the partitions that separate \u201cfamilies\u201d from \u201csingles\u201d (meaning men) are slowly going out of style. But decades of tradition are not easily swept away. This remains one of the most segregated societies in the world, with strict norms on gender conformity. The law bans men from \u201cbehaving like women\u201d and it is illegal to wear the clothes of the opposite sex. At Kore gym in Riyadh, designed by a female architect and entirely operated by women since it opened last year, women train on fearsome-looking machines or crawl on the floor with bands across their legs as part of the \u201cworkout of the day\u201d. In one corner, 18-year-old weightlifter Shirah Abdullah gulps water and chats with a friend between reps of lifting 200lb barbells. Asked what draws her to the space, she grins and says: \u201cThe community \u2013 it\u2019s amazing here.\u201d Kore is one of a growing number of gyms for women made possible by a change in licensing laws \u2013 a rebuke to an earlier crackdown enacted by clerics who claimed that gyms would encourage women to leave their families. The owners of Kore say several new branches are planned. But this is not without risk; the Saudi General Sports Authority closed one such gym this year, claiming that a video on social media showing a woman exercising in tight sportswear was \u201cpromoting the gym disgracefully and breaching the kingdom\u2019s code of conduct\u201d. *** The women-only basement of the Panorama mall in Riyadh stands deserted, with unlit window displays of pale lace ballgowns and wedding dresses in an empty space tinted soft pink by neon lights. The ministry of labour has identified retail as a target sector for increased female employment, but this part of the mall will soon make way for a cinema, another symbol of the new Saudi Arabia. The upstairs mall \u2013 now mixed gender \u2013 will remain. Some women will miss segregation.

She points out that Saudi Arabia introduced a new anti-harassment law in May, but women still have to battle a conservative culture to report problems. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing at work, where there\u2019s more respect \u2013 it\u2019s another thing for people on the street,\u201d Jaber says. \u201cOn the street, people aren\u2019t afraid for their jobs.\u201d Yet she is hopeful of a future without public segregation. \u201cI don\u2019t feel we should be separated in restaurants or malls \u2013 that\u2019s what caused this problem in the first place,\u201d she says. \u201cSuddenly they removed the barriers and no one knows what to do \u2013 I met guys who were so nervous around women that they couldn\u2019t speak.\u201d Jaber is considering job options for when she graduates, and recently visited the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, where she saw no women in the building. \u201cThey told me they are starting to initiate female employment,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s all just talk.\u201d One thing is certain: while the world of women\u2019s work is evolving, public spaces are still dominated by men. As I leave a restaurant in Riyadh one evening, a large four-wheel drive pulls up next to me. \u201cYou must wear the hijab \u2013 cover your hair! Cover your hair!\u201d a man roars, his voice filled with rage. The logo of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice is emblazoned on the car door. The officer looks over again in disgust, and drives away. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>About 2,500 years ago, an audience took their places at a theatre in Athens for the premiere of a new murder drama. The protagonist, a returning war hero, was savagely stabbed to death, naked in his bath. The crime was thought particularly heinous as the killer was the victim\u2019s wife, Clytemnestra. Her name has become notorious for a uniquely feminine sort of villainy, and the story of the murder of her husband, Agamemnon, seen in Aeschylus\u2019s play of the same title in 458BC, has become an archetypal domestic murder plot.</p> <p>Even though female murderers are much rarer than male murderers in reality, the image of the female killer continues to fascinate. <em>Killing Eve</em> is just the latest example of popular culture\u2019s preoccupation with attractive young women who conceal a dark psychopathy: Villanelle is the embodiment of the classic female killer, who both seduces and repels.</p> <p>For hundreds of years, executions for capital crimes took place in public. As well as a community ritual of punishment and a warning to potential miscreants, executions were regarded very much as entertainment. By the 1850s, when newspapers had reached the mass market, a voracious appetite for crime stories had grown, particularly for murders involving women. In 1849, Maria Manning, a Swiss ladies\u2019 maid, shot her former lover. Her husband, Frederick, finished him off with a crowbar before they buried the body under the kitchen flagstones. The case, suffused with a heady atmosphere of greed and sex, was a sensation in the press, which dubbed it the \u201cBermondsey Horror\u201d. Though it was a joint enterprise, the alluring Maria was the primary focus of the news reports. One publisher sold 2.5m pamphlets about the case, at a time when the population of Britain was only 20 million. The execution of the Mannings was witnessed by as many as 50,000 people; murder committed by a woman was a national event and Maria\u2019s demise had become a national sport.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The figures of accused murderers would be put on display in Madame Tussauds as soon as the perpetrators were executed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A milestone in female murderers as subjects of mass entertainment was 1835, when Madame Tussauds first opened its Chamber of Horrors in London. Just a few years before the arrival of practical photography, an extra sixpence allowed visitors to the waxworks museum to see a gallery of infamous killers at close quarters, 14 of whom were \u201cmurderesses\u201d. The figures of accused murderers were crafted during their trials and would be put on display as soon as the perpetrators were executed. Such speedy turnarounds were a response to insatiable public demand. The wax model of Mary Pearcey, executed on 23 December 1890 for killing her lover\u2019s wife and baby, was unveiled three days later, on Boxing Day, ghoulishly surrounded by much of the furniture from the murder scene, which had been purchased from the police. She attracted a record crowd of 31,000 visitors in one day. Such was the cachet of the malevolent murderess that the model of Maria Manning remained on display from 1849 until 1971, making her the longest-serving murderer in the Chamber of Horrors\u2019 history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02daba4f7f7aff13f8d49d48d1d30237e1a3fb4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02daba4f7f7aff13f8d49d48d1d30237e1a3fb4f/0_137_2050_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Arterton in Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gemma Arterton in<em> Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2013, while working as editor at <em>The Archers</em>, I became interested in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/feb/28/sally-challen-wins-appeal-against-conviction-for-murdering-husband\" title=\"\">Sally Challen, who three years earlier had murdered</a> her abusive husband of 31 years. I wondered if it was possible to tell the story of an ordinary middle-class woman driven to kill her husband over hundreds of episodes. My impulse coincided with plans to change the law regarding coercive control. Could we dramatise this new law in action? Helen Archer, hitherto famous for her cheese and her difficult past, would fall for Rob Titchener, who would systematically undermine Helen\u2019s sense of herself. The murder scene itself was modelled on Winnie Verloc\u2019s murder of her husband in Conrad\u2019s <em>The Secret Agent</em> \u2013 she stabs him with a carving knife in the parlour \u2013 as well as the climactic killing in <em>Tess of the D\u2019Ubervilles</em>; again the story of an abused wife pushed beyond the limit. While discussing the story with our legal researchers, we learned that it would be a cut and dried case if Helen killed Rob. She could make a manslaughter plea and probably be out of custody in time for Christmas. But it would be much more complicated if Rob survived and was able to give evidence against Helen in court. Then she might actually be convicted for attempted murder, imprisoned for life and parted from her son and baby, who would then be in the custody of her husband, who the audience knew was a serial abuser. We would have listeners screaming at the radio. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/the-archers-call-to-help-domestic-abuse-victims-as-titchener-trial-starts\" title=\"\">Being a soap opera, we of course</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/the-archers-call-to-help-domestic-abuse-victims-as-titchener-trial-starts\" title=\"\"> took the more complex route</a>, but allowed Helen to be found not guilty after some damning evidence from Rob\u2019s first wife; much to the relief of the 5 million <em>Archers</em> listeners who had been moved, gripped and appalled by Helen\u2019s story.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Sally Challen\u2019s case was reviewed in the light of the Serious Crime Act, which made coercive control an offence, leading to her release. Her case \u2013 as well as Helen Archer\u2019s \u2013 feels very much of our time, revealing changing attitudes to female killers and domestic abuse, a recognition that murder can be more complex than a rigid dichotomy of killer and victim. Researching the trials of various female killers for Helen\u2019s story, I was struck by how murder cases involving women always shone a light on the age and culture in which they took place. This led me to the story of Alma Rattenbury, which I knew to be one of the great murder trials of the early tabloid age. As I read more about this tragic case, it seemed to reveal the tensions and prejudices of interwar Britain with startling clarity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a51a887635e0d27e6e0b7598132987dc36400187\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51a887635e0d27e6e0b7598132987dc36400187/0_0_3021_4262/709.jpg\" alt=\"Alma Rattenbury.\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-life soap \u2026 Alma Rattenbury, who was tried for her husband\u2019s murder in 1935.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 27 May 1935, Rattenbury, a middle-aged song-writer from Canada, three times married and with two young sons, stood trial at the Old Bailey for the murder of her husband. In the dock next to her was her co-accused, her 18-year-old chauffeur, George Stoner. At the Rattenburys\u2019 retirement villa in Bournemouth, Francis Rattenbury had been struck three times with a mallet with such force that his false teeth had fallen out. He was left to bleed to death. The story seemed to be a classic farce scenario \u2013 the elderly miser cuckolded by a randy young servant and his insatiable wife. Alma was, the press insisted, \u201can inhuman ghoul\u201d who had seduced and incited her chauffeur to commit a \u201cpeculiarly horrible murder\u201d, a seaside Lady Macbeth. The Daily Express sent, not a crime correspondent, but its theatre critic, James Agate, to \u201creview\u201d the proceedings. Each day there were long queues for the public gallery and seats changed hands for \u00a310 a piece. Alma\u2019s trial was public theatre with a highly engaged national audience. She was the leading lady.</p> <p>The newspapers were obsessed with Alma\u2019s appearance. Her clothing, even her gestures and sighs were scrutinised as indications either of her guilt or, at least, her moral degeneracy. Attractive, stylish and photogenic, she was perfect casting for the tabloids that had been ushered in by the press baron Lord Northcliffe, whose infamous motto was \u201cGet Me a Murder a Day\u201d. Alma\u2019s story played out on the front pages for months, a soap opera with all the elements to keep readers titillated and addicted to the latest twist: sex, drugs, violence and a real-life siren pleading for her life at the heart of the plot. From a 21st-century perspective, the Rattenbury trial looks like an exercise in misogyny, condoned by the law in the full glare of the tabloid press. Acquitted of the murder, she took her own life days later. She had been tried less for what she might have done and more for the sort of woman she seemed to be. She bobbed her hair, smoked, drank, took drugs and regarded herself as the friend, not the employer, of her servants. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dac7ce6be7515bc48b777bed3edac642316e9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dac7ce6be7515bc48b777bed3edac642316e9c9/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Challen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sally Challen, whose conviction in 2011 for murdering her husband was overturned this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, in the original press reports of her case in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/08/my-mother-sally-challen-killed-my-father-finally-justice\" title=\"\">Challen was depicted as a neurotic and jealous wife</a> who counted her husband\u2019s condoms and Viagra pills as evidence of his infidelity.

Would be a shame to see the end of stars like Benji Marshall and Robbie Farah. \u201cThere\u2019s no next week if you don\u2019t win this week,\u201d said a deflated Benji post-game. They\u2019ve done it easily in the end - but what a statement from the Giants! They\u2019ve not only beaten the team second on the ladder, they\u2019ve hammered them. Jeremy Cameron\u2019s finished with six, Harry Himmelberg\u2019s kicked four, while Findlayson\u2019s put the boots back in the bag after that first quarter spree, adding just a solitary behind for 3.1. Brodie Grundy was immense for the Pies - they tried to double mark him in the ruck, and the big man\u2019s still managed 48 hitouts, 31 touches and a goal. Nine tackles and four marks. What a shift. Plenty of willing workers in black and white, but they just couldn\u2019t handle the Giants front line. A big, big result - and one that could have some ramifications on percentage, come finals spots. NRL - 60\u2019 gone: Canberra Raiders 20-12 Wests Tigers It\u2019s a real war of attrition here. Benji Marshall is trying to spark his troops, there\u2019s some very tired bodies out there on both sides. We\u2019ve had no score from either side for over 20 minutes - the Raiders haven\u2019t added to their tally since about the 20th minute when Rapana crossed, and it\u2019s Wests with momentum. Can they bring it home though? AFL - three-quarter-time: GWS Giants 13.5 (83) lead Collingwood 7.7 (49) They like kicking towards this end, don\u2019t they, the Giants? Eight in the first quarter, now four in this quarter. The Pies have edged it back a little - 4.5 plays 4.3 - but they\u2019re running desperately out of time, having technically won the last two stanzas. We talked about the \u201cJeremy show\u201d of Cameron and Findlayson, but in the stripes of Collingwood Jeremy Howe has just joined the party. We\u2019ll wait and see if I can find a nice gif for you - but that was an absolute humdinger of a mark from the Pies defender! Mark of the year? We\u2019ll see. NRL - half-time: Canberra Raiders 20-6 Wests Tigers They\u2019ve dominated in almost every statistical category, the Mean Machine. Some real Ricky-ball in action, just doing the simple things right and grinding their opponents down through their consistency. Some sprinklings of sparkle-dust along the way though, like this from Aidan Sezer: Football: Western Sydney Wanderers v Leeds United And our man with the plan, JP Howcroft, is keeping a close eye on Western Sydney Wanderers official return to their former fortress at Parramatta - after three years in the wilderness, as eponymous Wanderers. Their opponents aren\u2019t to shabby - a little club called Leeds United, with the one, the only, Marcelo Bielsa at the helm. Follow every kick of that one, here: NRL - 15\u2019 gone: Canberra 12-0 Wests Tigers A bright start for the Raiders who have started with a point-a-minute opening with Dunamis Lui and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad crossing for tries. That\u2019s right. Dunamis and Charnze. Forget Thelma and Louise or Milo and Otis. Now here\u2019s a duo. AFL - half-time: GWS Giants 9.2 (56) lead Collingwood 3.2 (20) How do you follow up an 8.2 opening quarter? Well, apparently, if you\u2019re the Giants, it\u2019s by going 26 minutes without a score. Don\u2019t let the scoreline fool you, Collingwood came back into the contest that quarter - they just couldn\u2019t quite make it translate numerically. They have to be careful not to go into their shells, the Giants. They\u2019re far too far out to try and shut up shop and creep home. Still a fascinating half to come. We\u2019re not far from kick-off in our second NRL fixture of the afternoon. If you missed the overnight action from the Golf, it\u2019s been a wild few days for Rory McIlroy. Andy Bull with a lovely write up - how to capture one of the worst rounds of golf you\u2019ll see, followed by one of the best? When the stars falter, opportunities present for others though - Australia\u2019s Cameron Smith two off the lead, just quietly. AFL: Greater Western Sydney 8.2 (50) leads Collingwood 1.1 (7) Ay carumba. You\u2019ve heard of double jeopardy; but this is double Jeremy. It\u2019s the Cameron and Findlayson show - three goals a piece as the Giants have shrugged off recent indifferent form to send a first-quarter statement in Homebush! Are we on track for a 200-er?! It\u2019s their third best-ever opening in Giants history. Can they kick on from here? You don\u2019t write off a team sitting second on the ladder, but wowee. They\u2019ll need something special from here, the Pies. Yikes. You can thank old Nostradamus here, who at half-time called this as a potential nail-biter ... (the cheque\u2019s in the mail, I hope, Trent Robinson). SEVEN second half tries for the Roosters - that Latrell 90m dash really sparked something. Even my boy Mitchy Aubusson got one. Love him. Latrell with 8/8 from the boot just to really rub the salt in. Poor old Nathan Brown. He\u2019s seen a bit in his young NRL coaching career - but he\u2019ll be scratching his head here. They\u2019d looked so good in the first half, the Knights! They huffed and puffed that final quarter, the Suns, but they never got any closer than that three-quarter-time mark of 18 behind. Four wins in six for Carlton, and back-to-back wins for the first time in over two years! Halcyon days for the long-sufferers - who saw this coming after they started the season 1-10, the Blues. Kennedy finishing with four goals, McKay 2.2 - eleven different goalscorers for the hosts, perhaps disappointed not to register the 100pts. Better from the Suns (at least in comparison to their last two outings) - but if they can\u2019t win this one, what can they win? Much to muse over for Stuart Dew and his staff. AFL: Greater Western Sydney v Collingwood - underway! So, we\u2019ve had first bounce in our third AFL fixture of the day and it\u2019s first blood Giants, as Finlayson finishes a coast-to-coast move. Six hosting two, we\u2019ll keep the eyes on this one, it could be the clash of the round (although Bomber fans might have some words on that following Friday night\u2019s showing). NRL - 60\u2019 gone: Roosters 24-10 Knights Just as I was threatening to get excited about another possible boilover the Sydney big men have stood up. Latrell Mitchell and the skipper Boyd Cordner both crashing over early in the second half to put some comfort into this scoreline. One of Taree\u2019s finest with a sucker punch, sometimes it\u2019s fine margins that determine footy matches and Jesse Ramien\u2019s attempted grubber has been punished here by Latrell. AFL - three-quarter-time: Carlton 13.6 (84) lead Gold Coast 10.6 (66) Hello! Hand me my Suns six-goal quarter klaxon! That\u2019s been on the shelf for years now (can\u2019t remember why I bought it, really). And it prompt the speculation: surely, not? We\u2019ve seen the Blues absolutely butcher some games this season (and others), but letting this slip would surely take some beating. They got to 40+ ahead halfway through the third, Carlton, and it was almost like the rarified air made everyone\u2019s noses bleed. From there the Suns rattled four straight goals - scoring 5/6 of the late action. Three majors the difference. We\u2019ve got a final quarter for you here! Comfortable in the end, as the Tigers purr their way into some handy form, with finals lurking on the horizon. Four straight wins for the first time all season, although Tom Lynch might rue missed chances to close in on Jeremy Cameron in the Coleman. He finished with 3.4 having pulled down nine marks. Riewoldt with 3.1, while Prestia and Martin hit 30 disposals. Some hard workers for Port, with Amon, Broadbent, Boak and Byrne-Jones seeing plenty of it - just not in the right areas. Richmond dominating the contested possessions and looking slick in transition with their handball game. They stay fifth though, and will wait to see if the Pies, Lions or Eagles slip up. As mentioned in the Preamble, we\u2019ve got some big-ticket live action later - it\u2019s semi-finals time at the netball World Cup as the Diamonds take on South Africa\u2019s Proteas and hosts England face the Silver Ferns. Also from the UK, we\u2019ve Women\u2019s Ashes where Australiaa are travelling well thanks to, you guessed who, Ellyse Perry. There\u2019s been plenty written over the years about the remarkable former dual-international phenomenon, but here\u2019s another cracker from Geoff Lemon: NRL - half-time: Sydney Roosters 6-4 Newcastle Knights An old fashion low-scorer from the SCG in Sydney. James Tedesco backing up his Origin heroics to open the scoring with seven gone, but then it was defences on top for most of this. The Knights actually edging time with the pill and completing their sets better than their hosts (18/22 v 15/20), so Tautau Moga\u2019s four-pointer just before the break more than fair reward for their efforts. Let\u2019s see if the Ponga and Pearce show can really ruffle some Chooks after the break. AFL - three-quarter-time: Richmond 12.7 (79) lead Port Adelaide 7.7 (49) They\u2019ve led from the first whistle, the Tigers, but they\u2019ve never been too far away here, Port. No wild oscillations, just Richmond steadily building a brick-wall row by row: 5-2, 3-2, 4-3 the goals by quarter breakdown. Dusty Martin the touch-leader with 26, with Houli, Prestia and Ellis also lively. Riewoldt and Lynch leading the scoring with three and two goals respectively. Where can a spark come from for Port? AFL - half-time: Carlton 8.5 (53) lead Gold Coast 4.5 (29) They\u2019ve been diabolical in recent weeks (Months? Years?) but any hopes the Suns have brought out the guns today appear misplaced. They kicked two early, the visitors, through MacPherson and Rischitelli as they briefly threatened to fluster the Blues, but their lead didn\u2019t last too long as Setterfield, Kennedy and Lang hit back, with Fisher and O\u2019Brien majors late in the first sending Carlton comfortably on their way. A lower-scoring second quarter, but they\u2019ve pulled away to a 24-pt half-time lead, Carlton. How often do you get to say that. Hi all! It\u2019s another cracker-jack Saturday Sportwatch, with plenty on the local scene in the AFL and NRL - five fixtures from the former including the Blues-Suns cellar-dweller special, and three from the latter where there\u2019s a Knights-Roosters top-eight battle (I know!). Some big ticket items from overseas, where we\u2019ll have live Women\u2019s Ashes from the UK, and just around the corner, the netball World Cup semi-final as Australia takes on South Africa. Megan Maurice will be your point-by-point eyes on that, with Erin Delahunty bringing us an on-the-buzzer match report. In football, Western Sydney Wanderers open their return to Parra feel-good party times hosting the mercurial Marcelo Bielsa and Leeds United. JP Howcroft will bring you that kick-by-kick. It\u2019s a big Guardian Aust Sportwatch team for you, so let\u2019s crack on. As always, fire us a tweet or email to get involved, in the interim I\u2019ll get some updates from the early AFL fixtures to you.",

The outcome of the assembly will be closely watched by other councils planning to follow suit this year, and by Westminster which will hold its own national climate assembly in the autumn.</p> <p>Council officials say there is a clear intention to implement at least some of the recommendations. \u201cI hope there will be some concrete action that we can take forward as a council,\u201d said Georgia Gould, the council leader. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea of it being an open process \u2013 you are letting go of that control. Our climate is in a crisis and we need to act in radical new ways and this assembly is part of developing those new ideas.\u201d</p> <p>Ideas being considered include community energy projects such as solar panels on schools, GP surgeries and public buildings, a revolution in heating buildings that favours air source heat pumps over old-style gas boilers, better insulation and urban greening.</p> <p>Anti-car measures are also being considered, though motorists produce only 13% of emissions in the district, with the rest generated by energy use in buildings.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m keen that they should ban all cars. They should ban all gas boilers in newbuilds now. They should retrofit old buildings,\u201d said Rupert Cruise, one of the participants.</p> <p>But the assembly is diverse in age, ethnicity and outlook. Another juror, Neil Chappell, said: \u201cI\u2019m here to defend the motorist. Camden always hammers the motorist but only 10% of emissions is down to cars.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of Saturday\u2019s deliberations, participants will have spent 12 hours in three separate sessions listening to briefings, asking questions, debating with each other and coming up with solutions.</p> <p>They were recruited randomly via a street and door-knocking campaign. A shortlist was winnowed down to assure the final composition was demographically (but not necessarily politically) representative.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s first climate \u201ccitizens assembly\u201d opened its final session on Saturday morning at which more than 50 Londoners will decide on carbon-cutting measures they want their district to enact in order to confront climate change. Camden\u2019s Citizens Assembly, convened to interrogate what locals, neighbourhoods and the council can do for the environment, is deliberating action that would reduce fossil fuel usage in homes and public buildings and on roads. The wishlist will be considered by the council as it draws up an environment action plan for 2020. The outcome of the assembly will be closely watched by other councils planning to follow suit this year, and by Westminster which will hold its own national climate assembly in the autumn. Council officials say there is a clear intention to implement at least some of the recommendations. \u201cI hope there will be some concrete action that we can take forward as a council,\u201d said Georgia Gould, the council leader. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea of it being an open process \u2013 you are letting go of that control. Our climate is in a crisis and we need to act in radical new ways and this assembly is part of developing those new ideas.\u201d Ideas being considered include community energy projects such as solar panels on schools, GP surgeries and public buildings, a revolution in heating buildings that favours air source heat pumps over old-style gas boilers, better insulation and urban greening. Anti-car measures are also being considered, though motorists produce only 13% of emissions in the district, with the rest generated by energy use in buildings. \u201cI\u2019m keen that they should ban all cars. They should ban all gas boilers in newbuilds now. They should retrofit old buildings,\u201d said Rupert Cruise, one of the participants. But the assembly is diverse in age, ethnicity and outlook. Another juror, Neil Chappell, said: \u201cI\u2019m here to defend the motorist. Camden always hammers the motorist but only 10% of emissions is down to cars.\u201d By the end of Saturday\u2019s deliberations, participants will have spent 12 hours in three separate sessions listening to briefings, asking questions, debating with each other and coming up with solutions. They were recruited randomly via a street and door-knocking campaign. A shortlist was winnowed down to assure the final composition was demographically (but not necessarily politically) representative. The participants are being paid \u00a3150 in vouchers for their time. Some participants said that although they were keen to do something, they felt the real scope for action lay with the national government. After all, aircraft do not take off in Camden, there are no large power plants, and container ships do not pass through. \u201cMost people are informed and there is consensus, but people feel that individuals can\u2019t do much,\u201d said Khalil Miah. \u201cIt\u2019s up to national government to set the goalposts and the deadlines.\u201d Others said the process itself was a breath of fresh air, helping to address not just the crisis in the environment but the crisis in democracy too. \u201cIt is absolutely great,\u201d said Merve \u00d6ner, a student on the assembly. \u201cIt\u2019s a diverse community and it\u2019s delightful to involve them all. I think it should be implemented in lots of other countries.\u201d",

Defining a generation accurately often comes down to who\u2019s doing the defining, especially when it comes to movies. Usually you have to reach a certain age before you get to make a film, and by the time you do, the generation before you have already said their bit. However, there comes a time when the power tilts, and for millennials, that time is now.</p> <p>A new season at the <a href=\"https://www.bam.org/\">Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM)</a> in New York offers a snapshot of the millennial generation coming of age in the movies. Called We Can\u2019t Even (how\u2019s that for a generation-splitting title?), it offers a first draft of what the millennial movie canon might look like (according to the Pew Research Center\u2019s definition, a \u201cmillennial\u201d is anyone born between 1981 and 1996). The selection is eclectic, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/how-we-made-dazed-and-confused-richard-linklater-wiley-wiggins\">Richard Linklater\u2019s</a> (white, American) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/boyhood-review-richard-linklater-film\">Boyhood</a> to C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s (black, French) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/26/girlhood-film-karidja-toure-assa-sylla-celine-sciamma\">Girlhood</a>; from iPhone-shot trans drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/10/tangerine-film-iphone-buddy-comedy-transgender-prostitutes\">Tangerine</a> to Edward Snowden documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/16/citizen-four-review-edward-snowden-documentary\">Citizenfour</a>; from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2013/jan/29/tina-feys-mean-girls-movie-classic\">Mean Girls</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/moonlight-review-masculinity-naomie-harris\">Moonlight</a>.

On paper they are the most educated, diverse and materially privileged generation in history but, in the western world at least, millennials are also the first to face dimmer prospects than their elders. Some of them became pop stars and tech entrepreneurs; many more are paying off student debts in dead-end jobs that didn\u2019t require a college degree anyway. What\u2019s more, they have been guinea pigs in a digital revolution that has transformed civilisation in ways we are still barely getting to grips with.</p> <p>According to Clark, the one film that encapsulates the millennial experience is Brady Corbet\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/01/vox-lux-review-natalie-portman-raffey-cassidy-jude-law-brady-corbet\">Vox Lux</a>, which follows a troubled female pop diva through the early 21st century. Beginning with a high-school shooting, the film traverses a landscape marked by terrorism, trauma, anxiety, celebrity, exploitation and alienation. If there is a defining millennial snapshot in Vox Lux, it would be a mock music video with our teen star (played by Raffey Cassidy) in a glittery mask, singing an electropop ballad called Hologram from the back seat of a motorbike speeding into a dark tunnel.</p> <p>Then again, no less representative a snapshot would be the teens in Girlhood, who steal smart dresses, rent a hotel room, get wasted and dance together to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/05/rihanna-named-worlds-richest-female-musician\">Rihanna\u2019s</a> Diamonds. Or Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg at the end of The Social Network, alone with his laptop, mechanically hitting refresh as he awaits a response to his friend request to his ex-girlfriend. Or perhaps the airheaded, reality TV-obsessed LA teens of Sofia Coppola\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/04/the-bling-ring-review\">The Bling Ring</a> saying \u201cOh my God\u201d as they break into Paris Hilton\u2019s shoe room, having used the internet to work out where she lives and when she\u2019s out of town. </p> <p>Not that older film-makers can\u2019t be sympathetic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/20/dont-worry-he-wont-get-far-on-foot-review-gus-van-sant-joaquin-phoenix-sundance-2018\">Gus Van Sant</a> (born 1952) and Richard Linklater (born 1960) created key Generation X texts, such as My Own Private Idaho and Slacker.

The film\u2019s sympathies lie with Stiller, and these on-trend hipsters turn out to be more calculating than they first appear.</p> <p>Now, having helped define her generation as an actor, Gerwig has come into her own as a director, and the contrast with Baumbach\u2019s view is striking.

Her millennial heroine, played by Saoirse Ronan, is winningly vulnerable and insecure, but also smart, opinionated, defiant and determined.

Olivia Wilde\u2019s Booksmart felt like a significant upgrade of a classic teen-comedy template.

Henry VIII built the castle in the east (now leased by the John Lewis partnership as a hotel for its staff). I love the tale of Colonel William Petrie Waugh and his wife Mary, who bought the island in the 1850s thinking they\u2019d found a source of high-quality clay and built a pottery, village and church, but fled to Spain bankrupt when the material proved substandard.

      "bodyText": "The first time I hear a peacock scream it scares the bejesus out of me. I\u2019m sussing out my tree tent \u2013 cleverly strung between four sweet chestnuts a few feet off the ground \u2013 and the sound stops me in my tracks. The bird struts past, glorious tail ablaze, in pursuit of the less colourful (and seemingly unimpressed) peahen before embarking on an elaborate twerking ritual. Close encounters with nature are part of any experience on Brownsea Island, the largest isle in Dorset\u2019s Poole harbour and the second biggest natural harbour in the world after Sydney. As I sit back and soak up the view across to the Purbeck Hills, I spy white bunny tails disappear into bushes; oystercatchers flap above the sea and I lock eyes with a sika deer grazing nearby before she darts gracefully away. Ten minutes by ferry from the mainland, National Trust-owned Brownsea is an Enid Blyton hideaway \u2013 it inspired the Famous Five\u2019s adventures on Whispering Island. But it\u2019s perhaps best known as the birthplace of the Scout movement: in 1907, Lord (then plain Major) Baden-Powell brought a group of 20 boys here to take part in an experimental camp, living close to nature and practising practical skills he had learned in the army during the Boer War. It launched a global movement, and now groups from 75 countries visit the island each year. Until recently only Scouts, Guides and other private groups could camp here \u2013 but a new \u201ceco-camping\u201d option now welcomes the general public on certain dates, with numbers capped at 30 mid-week or 150 at weekends. There are tents or hammocks for hire (including three tree tents, hung by the organisers), or visitors can bring their own, while gas cooking stations and all utensils are provided. Hot water for showers is heated by biomass, using wood from the island, and there\u2019s a sheltered communal dining area. I arrive on the last ferry from Sandbanks. As the daytrippers head home, I can\u2019t help feeling a little smug. The campsite\u2019s on the south shore, a 20-minute walk from the dock, and in late May I\u2019m the only person staying. I wander into the forest and it\u2019s not long until I spot a red squirrel, and then another \u2013 Brownsea is home to one of England\u2019s last colonies. I\u2019ve been given a star chart and as darkness falls I study the constellations before climbing into my tent. It\u2019s a bit like sleeping on a trampoline, but there are no issues with hard ground or deflating mattresses and I wake around dawn to the sound of a woodpecker tapping overhead. Despite its size \u2013 just one and a half miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide \u2013 Brownsea has wide-ranging habitat, from heathland to sheltered lagoons and woodland with more than 100 tree species. For kids, it\u2019s an adventure playground: there are nature trails, crayon rubbings and tree climbing routes, and a natural play area. Regular ranger-led safaris hunt for wildlife and, over the summer, special family adventure weekends run too, with campfires and activities from archery to canoeing. I\u2019m not always a fan of organised tours, but there are two free introductory guided walks daily, and volunteer Clive brings the island\u2019s history to life so vividly I\u2019m soon wondering why there hasn\u2019t been a BBC drama about this place. So many colourful characters have shaped the island. Henry VIII built the castle in the east (now leased by the John Lewis partnership as a hotel for its staff). I love the tale of Colonel William Petrie Waugh and his wife Mary, who bought the island in the 1850s thinking they\u2019d found a source of high-quality clay and built a pottery, village and church, but fled to Spain bankrupt when the material proved substandard. There was bon vivant tobacco baron Charles van Raalte, who used it for holidays and insisted all employees played an instrument, and whose widow turned the whole place into a daffodil farm. In the 1920s came reclusive Mary Bonham-Christie, who banished all inhabitants and let nature take over. During the second world war the island served as a decoy for Poole, with pyrotechnics tricking Nazi bombers into targeting Brownsea instead. The north of the island, run by the Dorset Wildlife Trust, is a very different landscape again with lagoons and lakes. There are five hides for watching the prolific birdlife, and I sit for ages spotting common and sandwich terns, listening to their cries, before heading to the island\u2019s one cafe for a cup of tea.

      "body": "<p>While the traditional requirements of a lifelong marriage \u2013 fidelity, eternal selflessness and so on \u2013 are deeply unfashionable, getting married in 2019 still feels very \u201cin\u201d. I cried happy tears right through a gorgeous wedding last Saturday, and not just because of my blistered little toe in four-inch heels: it was that heroic sense of hope, faith and love that infuses the room at all good betrothals. Plus merging families, choked-up speeches, in-jokes, all-day drinking and happy guests who\u2019ve scrubbed up nicely.</p> <p>Yes, we live in an age where eschewing one\u2019s \u201cauthentic\u201d sexual urges is frowned upon (because you only live once!) and home ownership is so precious that making anyone legally entitled to swipe half of your property feels frankly idiotic. Nevertheless, we are still marrying. (Some are divorcing and marrying again. We continue to be those idiots.) For this, I blame, in no small part, Instagram, where getting married has never looked so wonderful. With roughly a billion active worldwide users, over half of whom are under 35, Instagram is the planet\u2019s greatest modern-day advert for spending at least \u00a330k \u2013 often much, much more \u2013 on a big blow-out do.</p> <p>In the summer of 2019, anyone who\u2019s been single for longer than they\u2019d possibly prefer knows the pain of bedtime scrolling through flower-festooned village churches, sandy-toed mothers of the bride, cupcake towers and, of course, that end-of-the-big-day shot where two people cling together laughing, in black and white, above a caption that simply reads: \u201cFinally married THIS one.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, getting married has about as much to do with being married as attending the Academy Awards has to do with spending six months in the Philippines filming Apocalypse Now during Typhoon Olga. A wedding involves fittings, sculptings and your very best self drinking champagne and being adored. Marriage, on the other hand, is standing in your kitchen going, \u201cWhere the hell have all these ants come from? You said you\u2019d buy poison\u201d and \u201cIs this a spot on my back, or a boil? If it has a head, can you squeeze it?\u201d None of the latter involve sugared almonds in tiny gauze bags or a harpist playing Bryan Adams. You\u2019d think by now we\u2019d have worked this out, but seemingly not.</p> <p>Despite giving my divorce lawyer carte blanche to thwack me over the head with a big mallet and lock me in his stationery cupboard if I ever mention marriage again, I have caught myself, of late, staring at Instagram stories of women with good arms in Vera Wang nude-and light-ivory tulle with hand-finished gold Chantilly lace bodices, being 100% that amazing bitch, and I have thought: \u201cOh, but could it really hurt?\u201d To cure myself, I scour Mumsnet and Reddit for tales of brides and grooms going fully bonkers in the run-up to their big day. Their insanity keeps me sane. My favourite this year is a bride who wrote to one guest insisting she buy tattoo camouflage cream, as her blue arm inkings would spoil the wedding colour scheme. Another bride sent out a weight chart decreeing anyone over 80kg wear only dark colours, or have the common decency to loiter at the back of the group photo.</p> <p>My other favourite sport is tracking, via Instagram stories, groups of relative strangers on week-long wedding jaunts to the Algarve or the Carribean, involving dinners and group activities night-after-night. Is it wrong that I enjoy scanning the crowd for bulging eyes and bitten lips? We are ripe for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/06/midsommar-review-florence-pugh-ari-aster-horror-hereditary\" title=\"\">Midsommar</a>-style horror movie about a group trapped in Mauritius, forced to barbecue every evening, disappearing eerily one by one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/06/grace-dent-failed-driving-test-why-have-i-bought-a-car\">I failed my driving test six times in 2005 alone. Exactly why have I bought a car? | Grace Dent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, it\u2019s little surprise that, first millennials, and now Generation Z, in the face of all this hashtagged Hefe-filtered glamour, are still falling like dominoes around the age of 26. Pray for the poor man in a long-term relationship, still holding out at 32, not really wanting to propose, but already the last of his group, swimming fruitlessly against a tide of #famalam first babies and surprise #shesaidyes Christmas proposals. Think of him enduring a long, passive-aggressive day with his partner watching more friends tie the knot; the silence of the journey home; the terseness of the \u201cOh you beauts! Perfect day!\u201d comments that his partner leaves under every single photo.</p> <p>I thought for decades that many people got married because it was easier than the fights about staying unhitched. Then along came Instagram, filled with ceremonies in small private vineyards where the bride arrives by carriage, or the grooms both leave by hot-air balloon. And weddings in stately homes where the guests play croquet, and a hog is roasted, and the bride\u2019s waist is so waspish \u2013 and have the couple had their teeth bleached, because it seems so? These wedding days are filled with love, the giddy kind of fresh love that looks great on camera, rather than the love that is begrudging, sore-hearted or enduring \u201cin spite of everything\u201d. No wonder it is still so amazingly fashionable. Being married can be a ball-ache, but every one of us deserves a wedding.</p>",

      "bodyText": "While the traditional requirements of a lifelong marriage \u2013 fidelity, eternal selflessness and so on \u2013 are deeply unfashionable, getting married in 2019 still feels very \u201cin\u201d. I cried happy tears right through a gorgeous wedding last Saturday, and not just because of my blistered little toe in four-inch heels: it was that heroic sense of hope, faith and love that infuses the room at all good betrothals. Plus merging families, choked-up speeches, in-jokes, all-day drinking and happy guests who\u2019ve scrubbed up nicely. Yes, we live in an age where eschewing one\u2019s \u201cauthentic\u201d sexual urges is frowned upon (because you only live once!) and home ownership is so precious that making anyone legally entitled to swipe half of your property feels frankly idiotic. Nevertheless, we are still marrying. (Some are divorcing and marrying again. We continue to be those idiots.) For this, I blame, in no small part, Instagram, where getting married has never looked so wonderful. With roughly a billion active worldwide users, over half of whom are under 35, Instagram is the planet\u2019s greatest modern-day advert for spending at least \u00a330k \u2013 often much, much more \u2013 on a big blow-out do. In the summer of 2019, anyone who\u2019s been single for longer than they\u2019d possibly prefer knows the pain of bedtime scrolling through flower-festooned village churches, sandy-toed mothers of the bride, cupcake towers and, of course, that end-of-the-big-day shot where two people cling together laughing, in black and white, above a caption that simply reads: \u201cFinally married THIS one.\u201d Of course, getting married has about as much to do with being married as attending the Academy Awards has to do with spending six months in the Philippines filming Apocalypse Now during Typhoon Olga. A wedding involves fittings, sculptings and your very best self drinking champagne and being adored. Marriage, on the other hand, is standing in your kitchen going, \u201cWhere the hell have all these ants come from? You said you\u2019d buy poison\u201d and \u201cIs this a spot on my back, or a boil? If it has a head, can you squeeze it?\u201d None of the latter involve sugared almonds in tiny gauze bags or a harpist playing Bryan Adams. You\u2019d think by now we\u2019d have worked this out, but seemingly not. Despite giving my divorce lawyer carte blanche to thwack me over the head with a big mallet and lock me in his stationery cupboard if I ever mention marriage again, I have caught myself, of late, staring at Instagram stories of women with good arms in Vera Wang nude-and light-ivory tulle with hand-finished gold Chantilly lace bodices, being 100% that amazing bitch, and I have thought: \u201cOh, but could it really hurt?\u201d To cure myself, I scour Mumsnet and Reddit for tales of brides and grooms going fully bonkers in the run-up to their big day. Their insanity keeps me sane. My favourite this year is a bride who wrote to one guest insisting she buy tattoo camouflage cream, as her blue arm inkings would spoil the wedding colour scheme. Another bride sent out a weight chart decreeing anyone over 80kg wear only dark colours, or have the common decency to loiter at the back of the group photo. My other favourite sport is tracking, via Instagram stories, groups of relative strangers on week-long wedding jaunts to the Algarve or the Carribean, involving dinners and group activities night-after-night. Is it wrong that I enjoy scanning the crowd for bulging eyes and bitten lips? We are ripe for a Midsommar-style horror movie about a group trapped in Mauritius, forced to barbecue every evening, disappearing eerily one by one. Still, it\u2019s little surprise that, first millennials, and now Generation Z, in the face of all this hashtagged Hefe-filtered glamour, are still falling like dominoes around the age of 26. Pray for the poor man in a long-term relationship, still holding out at 32, not really wanting to propose, but already the last of his group, swimming fruitlessly against a tide of #famalam first babies and surprise #shesaidyes Christmas proposals. Think of him enduring a long, passive-aggressive day with his partner watching more friends tie the knot; the silence of the journey home; the terseness of the \u201cOh you beauts! Perfect day!\u201d comments that his partner leaves under every single photo. I thought for decades that many people got married because it was easier than the fights about staying unhitched. Then along came Instagram, filled with ceremonies in small private vineyards where the bride arrives by carriage, or the grooms both leave by hot-air balloon. And weddings in stately homes where the guests play croquet, and a hog is roasted, and the bride\u2019s waist is so waspish \u2013 and have the couple had their teeth bleached, because it seems so? These wedding days are filled with love, the giddy kind of fresh love that looks great on camera, rather than the love that is begrudging, sore-hearted or enduring \u201cin spite of everything\u201d. No wonder it is still so amazingly fashionable. Being married can be a ball-ache, but every one of us deserves a wedding.",

      "body": "<p>It was 6pm when the smoke reached the town of Mati on the east coast of Greece, 18 miles from Athens. The seaside resort was full of holidaymakers in hotels, or visiting their weekend homes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/25/survivors-share-terror-as-magnitude-of-greek-wildfires-comes-to-light\" title=\"\">Within an hour</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/25/survivors-share-terror-as-magnitude-of-greek-wildfires-comes-to-light\" title=\"\">, flames had started to engulf the town</a>, turning the sky red.</p> <p> By 8pm on 23 July 2018, the fire had destroyed Mati and nearby Kokkino Limanaki; it left 103 dead and more than 140 in hospital, many with severe burns. People died in their homes, in their cars, or as they tried to get to the sea. Those who made it dipped below the waves to stay cool as they waited for the coastguard and local fishermen to rescue them. The flames were propelled by gale-force winds, and the heat reached 800C. The next day, officials estimated that about 40,000 pine and olive trees, along with 4,000 homes, had been destroyed.</p> <p>One year on, people are still asking how Greece\u2019s worst natural disaster could have happened. Before the fire, Mati had been synonymous with pleasure; it evoked the best of Greece, even if, like many resorts, it was also an unregulated hodgepodge of villas, houses and multistorey apartment blocks built beyond the gaze of town planners. Roads and utilities were basic. Beach-side tavernas, cafes and homes were all connected to a chaotic grid, with electricity supplied from power lines hung from wooden posts.</p> <p> The sense of shock was underlined by Mati\u2019s proximity to Athens. How could the authorities have bungled the rescue operations so badly? There had been no sirens, no warning system or evacuation plan. The blaze was initially ignored by emergency services, who were battling fires elsewhere; it is now believed to have been started by a man burning brushwood in the back yard of his home on Mount Penteli, west of Mati. Although the 65-year-old has been charged with arson, he has yet to face trial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56b80982d76644a5182056403d53554d9e155ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56b80982d76644a5182056403d53554d9e155ab5/0_0_3500_2626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of the area after a wildfire, in Mati, Greece, July 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After the inferno: Mati from the air.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fly Greece Drone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/08/syriza-demise-greece-alexis-tsipras\" title=\"\">Alexis Tsipras </a>\u2013 the then prime minister \u2013 laid the blame on the anarchic construction of a settlement built without proper planning. This was echoed last month by Maria Kleanthis, the civil servant heading the department of natural disasters at the ministry of infrastructure. \u201cMati personifies all the flaws and mischief of modern Greece,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople had built on the waterfront, in the forest, even in ravines.\u201d It was, she lamented, a peculiarly Greek phenomenon, replicated in no other EU state.</p> <p>But residents accuse the government of incompetence. \u201cAround 400 people got to the sea, so the [official] argument that there was no access or escape routes is rubbish,\u201d says Alexis Andronopoulos, whose family has a summer house in Mati, and who is credited with saving 18 mostly elderly Greeks on his motorbike that night.</p> <p>In March this year, prosecutors assigned to investigate the tragedy produced a 292-page report detailing \u201ca series of mistakes\u201d made by the authorities. It found that mismanagement by police and fire services, and a lack of coordination between rescue agencies, had resulted in \u201cchaos and a collapse of the system... criminal mistakes and omissions\u201d.</p> <p>When Tsipras visited Mati, weeks after the fire, he promised to create a \u201cmodel town\u201d within a year. But the plots here are still burned out, the land scorched. Some say that the government\u2019s handling of the fire was one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/07/greeks-choose-between-beach-and-ballot-in-first-post-debt-bailout-poll\" title=\"\">reason behind its defeat in general elections this month</a>. So far, home owners have received compensation cheques of up to \u20ac6,000 (\u00a35,400) each, but most are still struggling to acquire permits to do any repair work. As the community prepares to mark next week\u2019s anniversary with a low-key church service, its campaign for justice goes on: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/01/greek-wildfire-victims-families-file-suit-against-authorities\" title=\"\">several residents are pursuing private court cases against the government</a>. The survivors are adamant that the tragedy won\u2019t be forgotten.

I was in the water for seven hours and, in all that time, I never took off my trainers or shorts. Bits of wood and metal were flying through the air, cars were going up in flames and gas bottles at the beach cafe were exploding, forcing us to wade further in. I went in up to my neck. Everyone was really frightened.</p> <p>When the fire first reached the waterfront, many of us in the sea turned round so that our backs were facing the coast. We just stood there, arms crossed, as big clumps of molten ash rained down. The noise was tremendous. There must have been 400 people who ran into the sea. Some of them had been sitting in their cars because of the gridlock, hoping to get out.</p> <p>I arrived at the beach at about 6.40pm \u2013 I had been looking for a mask and some money I had hidden in the roof of our house, which was later obliterated in the fire. But when I couldn\u2019t find the cash and saw the smoke, I ran. My wife, Eleni, had already got out by car with Michaelangelos, our son.</p> <p>My mother, Fotini, was on the beach with our neighbour, Margarita, and her six-month-old baby. He was crying uncontrollably. Margarita was panicking, her eyes were totally glazed and I remember helping to pull up her shirt so she could breastfeed him; but soon he became unconscious and I had to administer CPR.</p> <p>To this day I cannot understand why the army wasn\u2019t dispatched to get us on boats, when fishermen were defying the smoke and doing just that. A lot of people, especially kids, were struggling to keep afloat. Once, when all of us saw a light in the distance, we shouted: \u201cHelp!\u201d</p> <p>I called 112, the emergency telephone number. They said they would come to our rescue, but never did. I still haven\u2019t forgiven myself for not putting Margarita and the baby over my shoulders and doing more to get to a hospital. When we finally got them to an ambulance, it was [too] late. The baby died later that night, and Margarita a week later.</p> <p>I still have nightmares. I am always in the sea \u2013 my legs freezing in the cold, my torso frying in the heat.</p> <h2><strong>Alexis Andronopoulos,</strong><strong> 50, a</strong><strong>n engineer, </strong><strong>rescued 18 people</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3543a4d5eff03413242a30eb063037507de92c4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3543a4d5eff03413242a30eb063037507de92c4c/0_1876_3000_2318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Andronopoulos, who rescued people from the fires in Greece in July 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"773\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Have lessons been learned? I don\u2019t think so\u2019: Alexis Andronopoulos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Vourloumis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I got on my motorbike at my office in Athens and headed to Mati at 6.30pm. I\u2019ve been a forest-fire volunteer for many years, but this time was different. My parents\u2019 summer home is there. I grew up with people who have apartments in the same block.</p> <p>They\u2019re all elderly now. I wanted to save them. It took me about 20 minutes to get there. I was stopped at the roadblock they\u2019d set up at the crossroads outside the town. I\u2019ll never forget the traffic policeman. He was adamant I was going nowhere. It was my first taste of state services. When, finally, I got in, at around 9pm, it was like a war zone, with cars and houses on fire, panic\u2011stricken people running up and down. Around the apartment block, a lot of vehicles were completely burnt out, just windows and wheels.</p> <p>Occasionally, something would explode. I was frightened and there was a moment when I thought: \u201cShould I stay or go?\u201d I found myself stepping over dead bodies as I approached the apartment building. Several corpses were sitting in cars. People who had remained in their apartments were, fortunately, saved; those who had moved from one flat to another were burned.</p> <p>It was hard to see in the smoke. The first woman I rescued was 80 and had just had a hip replacement. With some difficulty, I got her on the bike, saying: \u201cClose your eyes, hold me tight and don\u2019t think of anything.\u201d I took her up to the roadblock where another friend said her six-year-old daughter was trapped on the beach. I drove back and found her. I\u2019d seen a corpse in the alley leading to the shore, so led her through a garden on my way back. It was the only time I gave anyone my helmet. Again, I told her not to look.</p> <p>I did 18 runs, each time taking a person out and each time arguing with officers at the roadblock. I insisted it was safe to go in, but they kept saying they were under strict orders. Even an ambulance driver refused to use his walkie-talkie to ask for help. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/the-greeks-for-whom-all-the-talk-means-nothing-because-they-have-nothing\" title=\"\">In Greece, nothing works and nobody cares</a>. Special forces with anti-fire uniforms could have gone in earlier. The loss of life was greater because of the delayed response.</p> <p>For the past year, we\u2019ve been campaigning to help burn victims. The state didn\u2019t think about providing nurses for them, even when they were needed 24/7. Have lessons been learned? I don\u2019t think so. Authorities haven\u2019t even asked the basic question: how could 103 people die, 100 be injured, with not one fire-fighter among them?</p> <h2><strong>Kalli Anagnostou,</strong><strong> 37, and her son, Constantinos, </strong><strong>six, were </strong><strong>severely burned in the fire</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b7bd813581b4e3405edbecc185a7d5f01a7f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94b7bd813581b4e3405edbecc185a7d5f01a7f5b/0_1462_3000_2763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kalli Anagnostou, who was severely burned in the fires in Greece in July 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"921\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What happened was criminal\u2019: Kalli Anagnostou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Vourloumis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>It\u2019s as if the clock stopped at 6.30pm on 23 July. Even now, there are days when it feels as if we are back there. It was so violent, with explosions, corpses, cars, houses and trees on fire \u2013 and everywhere black, toxic smoke.</p> <p>We were holidaying at my in-laws\u2019 summer home. At the time, we lived in Dubai; now I joke that we left to escape the heat only to end up in the fire. That day we were taking it easy; I first heard the winds when I woke up from a siesta. I looked out of the window. There was smoke everywhere. Minutes later, I had grabbed my son, Constantinos, and was telling my father-in-law we had to leave.</p> <p>By the time we got out of the house, there were giant, two-metre-high flames barely two metres away. I remember looking back and seeing blackness. I didn\u2019t feel the flames. It was the heat that burned us \u2013 a thermal wave that preceded the fire. As we ran down the street, a neighbour came out of his house in a tiny car and we screamed at him to stop and take us. That saved us. Constantinos\u2019s flip-flops had melted. He was crying: \u201cMama, we\u2019re burning, Mama, we\u2019re burning.\u201d When we reached the port, a tourist appeared with a first-aid kit and bandaged his feet.</p> <p>There was a moment when I thought: \u201cThis is it, this is how it all ends.\u201d It\u2019s adrenaline that keeps you going. Somehow, my survival instinct prevailed.</p> <p>I was wearing Lycra leggings and a cotton top and had suffered fourth- and fifth-degree burns across 40% of my body, damaging several layers of my skin, muscle and nerves. After grafts, 80% of my body was affected. Constantinos was also severely burned. I was in a coma for three weeks while the doctors conducted plastic surgery. In total, I spent 67 days in hospital, 21 days in intensive care. Constantinos was in a trauma unit for 35 days and had daily skin-peeling procedures. I will need many more operations in the years ahead.</p> <p>Before the fire, I was an executive coach. Now, I am training to become a life coach, specialising in trauma. What happened was criminal and I am suing the government for negligence. Everything that was wrong with the Syriza government, the mistakes it made, its ineptitude, was exemplified by what happened here in Mati. It\u2019s not about the money. I see it more as an ethical issue; something I owe to my son.</p> <h2><strong>Tasos Gounarides, </strong><strong>47, a cake-shop owner, </strong><strong>is still living in a military camp with his family </strong><strong> after their</strong><strong> home was destroyed</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f3ca4750f214a8f77e0f534b9c8a73f3b633bfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f3ca4750f214a8f77e0f534b9c8a73f3b633bfb/0_99_3000_1745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tasos Gounarides, and his wife Dora, who survived the fires in Greece in July 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"582\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not one official has visited us\u2019: Tasos Gounarides and his wife Dora.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Vourloumis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We lost everything we ever owned. In minutes our house was gutted, our past erased. Every document and photo we ever had was lost to the flames. Still, we consider ourselves lucky. Damianos, my oldest, had broken his arm, so we were at the hospital in Evia when the fire erupted.</p> <p>With our home destroyed and nowhere else to go, the government put us in a summer camp that belongs to the air force, just outside Mati. It was meant to be a temporary solution, but 11 months later we are still there. There was talk of a rent subsidy, but those who were eligible said it stopped after two months. I didn\u2019t want to risk being out on the streets.</p> <p>Living in a two-room bungalow hasn\u2019t been easy, but what the fire has taught us is that less is more. The children have their own bedroom. We use ours as bedroom, kitchen, dining room and study. In winter, without any heating, it was cold and extremely damp.</p> <p>I have spent the past year gathering documents, going to lawyers, notaries and public offices so that I can prove that a house that is now a shell belongs to me. Each document comes at a cost. I must have spent \u20ac700 (\u00a3630) so far. Our home wasn\u2019t insured for fire.</p> <p>Not one official has visited us since the tragedy. After many weeks, Tsipras showed up, but he did so on a day when the media was on strike. Another time, he came at 6.30am so that nobody would see him. I\u2019ve heard \u20ac90m in private donations has been raised for Mati, but we haven\u2019t seen any of it. The only thing that seems to have been done is the clearing of charred trees.</p> <p>I\u2019m bothered that our memories have been extinguished. At times, I feel robbed. But situations like this make you stronger. I no longer make grandiose plans or get as anxious as I used to, and we\u2019ve become closer as a family.</p> <p>There are times when the past hits you. The other day, I found a picture on my phone of my neighbour, Emi, who drowned that night. I can\u2019t bring myself to erase her number.</p> <p>Weeks after the fire, as 18 volunteers were helping us remove debris from the house, we found my wedding ring under cement and broken roof tiles. I had been looking for it for over a year. It has our anniversary date engraved inside.

As concerned residents, we\u2019ve set up a committee to look into the disaster.</p> <p>We\u2019ve made a map locating where people died. Most were outside their houses. Had they been evacuated, or warned by church bells or sirens, they could have been saved.</p> <p>Anyone who survived did so because of pure luck. I know I did. At 6.40pm, I was one of the last people out, driving the wrong way up Marathonas Avenue. My neighbour four doors down, her daughter and two grand-daughters all died. Her last words on the phone to a friend were: \u201cThe fire is coming, we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of another country in Europe where the police, fire and emergency response services would be so disorganised. There\u2019s a fire hose right outside my house; it has never worked. That night, there wasn\u2019t a fire engine in sight, and no fire-fighting planes at all. I hear that police and firefighters were saying: \u201cWhy should we risk our lives when we only get paid \u20ac700 a month?\u201d</p> <p>It was the same even before the [economic] crisis. If you wanted the forest department to remove a dangerous tree \u2013 and there were a lot of them in these parts \u2013 you had to pay a bribe.</p> <p>Officials claim we\u2019re to blame because we prevented access to roads and built where we shouldn\u2019t have, without proper planning. It\u2019s become a line of defence to cover their own ineptitude. Over the years, houses like mine, which they now say are in forest land, have been legitimised by laws passed by a state that wanted to make money. If not, why did the government allow me to buy the house? Why did it accept \u20ac13,000 in taxes?</p> <p>It would take balls for any government to demolish everything that has been \u201cillegally\u201d built in this country. That\u2019s how Mati came to be created; that\u2019s why we now have a million \u201cillegal\u201d homes across Greece.</p> <h2><strong>Christiana Fragkou,</strong><strong> 58, own</strong><strong>s </strong><strong>a property where 26 people were found dead the day after the fire</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a6a37ef778d083752df9bfa9e70cbcaa7d99e443\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a37ef778d083752df9bfa9e70cbcaa7d99e443/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christiana Fragkou, who survived the fires in Greece in July 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One day I will rebuild a house here\u2019: Christiana Fragkou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eirini Vourloumis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>We\u2019ve been called the owners of the House of Death; the couple who built illegally and cut off access to the sea.</p> <p>The truth is, people were burned alive because traffic police misdirected drivers down to the coastal road.

That night, the winds were up to 10 on the Beaufort scale, so it was very choppy. And there was smoke everywhere; visibility was nil. It was 7pm when I got the call from a lady who buys fish from me, saying: \u201cMohammed, we\u2019re on the beach at Kokkino Limanaki and we\u2019re either going to burn or drown. Save us!\u201d My kids said: \u201cDaddy, if there are children, you must go.\u201d I decided to leave instantly.</p> <p>There were four of us who set out to help, but I couldn\u2019t even see the boat in front of me. My biggest worry was hitting someone who might be struggling in the water, or a rock, or one of the other vessels. From Nea Makri, where my boat Elpida (which means Hope) is moored, it usually takes 30 minutes to get to that part of the coast; but given the circumstances it took us three times that.</p> <p>The others headed to the port in Mati. I headed to Kokkino Limanaki. As I pulled in, I saw all these people huddled together, holding one another. Thirty minutes later and I think they would have died in the heat. A lot couldn\u2019t swim. Children and their parents were the first to get on board \u2013 about 20 of them sitting anywhere they could, in the cabin, on the sides, all in a state of shock. We sailed to Rafina in total silence until we reached the port, where some cried.</p> <p>I returned with an official from the coastguard. That time, we brought back 28. The last was a woman, an old, very large lady, who was sitting on a rock. She didn\u2019t want to budge. Her back and legs were burnt. She kept saying: \u201cMy boy, I\u2019ve lost everything, let me die here.\u201d I kept saying: \u201cNo way, you\u2019re coming with us.\u201d I hurt my knee heaving her on to Elpida. I still don\u2019t know if she made it, but she is the one I can\u2019t forget.</p> <p>A few days later, my engine conked out. I couldn\u2019t work for a month. It cost me \u00a45,000 to replace it. I had to borrow the money and am still paying it off. Lots of people ask me what they can give me, because I saved their families. But how I can accept anything from people who\u2019ve lost everything? Prime minister Alexis Tsipras invited me and my family to his office. That was nice. I was granted Greek citizenship after my daughter, also called Elpida, asked Tsipras. I\u2019ve lived in Greece since the age of 17, when I left Egypt.</p> <p>But I\u2019ve still not received any compensation for the engine. I\u2019ve spoken to MPs about it. If someone asked me for help again, I\u2019d go. But if the state asked, I\u2019m not so sure.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was 6pm when the smoke reached the town of Mati on the east coast of Greece, 18 miles from Athens. The seaside resort was full of holidaymakers in hotels, or visiting their weekend homes. Within an hour, flames had started to engulf the town, turning the sky red. By 8pm on 23 July 2018, the fire had destroyed Mati and nearby Kokkino Limanaki; it left 103 dead and more than 140 in hospital, many with severe burns. People died in their homes, in their cars, or as they tried to get to the sea. Those who made it dipped below the waves to stay cool as they waited for the coastguard and local fishermen to rescue them. The flames were propelled by gale-force winds, and the heat reached 800C. The next day, officials estimated that about 40,000 pine and olive trees, along with 4,000 homes, had been destroyed. One year on, people are still asking how Greece\u2019s worst natural disaster could have happened. Before the fire, Mati had been synonymous with pleasure; it evoked the best of Greece, even if, like many resorts, it was also an unregulated hodgepodge of villas, houses and multistorey apartment blocks built beyond the gaze of town planners. Roads and utilities were basic. Beach-side tavernas, cafes and homes were all connected to a chaotic grid, with electricity supplied from power lines hung from wooden posts. The sense of shock was underlined by Mati\u2019s proximity to Athens. How could the authorities have bungled the rescue operations so badly? There had been no sirens, no warning system or evacuation plan. The blaze was initially ignored by emergency services, who were battling fires elsewhere; it is now believed to have been started by a man burning brushwood in the back yard of his home on Mount Penteli, west of Mati. Although the 65-year-old has been charged with arson, he has yet to face trial. Alexis Tsipras \u2013 the then prime minister \u2013 laid the blame on the anarchic construction of a settlement built without proper planning. This was echoed last month by Maria Kleanthis, the civil servant heading the department of natural disasters at the ministry of infrastructure. \u201cMati personifies all the flaws and mischief of modern Greece,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople had built on the waterfront, in the forest, even in ravines.\u201d It was, she lamented, a peculiarly Greek phenomenon, replicated in no other EU state. But residents accuse the government of incompetence. \u201cAround 400 people got to the sea, so the [official] argument that there was no access or escape routes is rubbish,\u201d says Alexis Andronopoulos, whose family has a summer house in Mati, and who is credited with saving 18 mostly elderly Greeks on his motorbike that night. In March this year, prosecutors assigned to investigate the tragedy produced a 292-page report detailing \u201ca series of mistakes\u201d made by the authorities. It found that mismanagement by police and fire services, and a lack of coordination between rescue agencies, had resulted in \u201cchaos and a collapse of the system... criminal mistakes and omissions\u201d. When Tsipras visited Mati, weeks after the fire, he promised to create a \u201cmodel town\u201d within a year. But the plots here are still burned out, the land scorched. Some say that the government\u2019s handling of the fire was one reason behind its defeat in general elections this month. So far, home owners have received compensation cheques of up to \u20ac6,000 (\u00a35,400) each, but most are still struggling to acquire permits to do any repair work. As the community prepares to mark next week\u2019s anniversary with a low-key church service, its campaign for justice goes on: several residents are pursuing private court cases against the government. The survivors are adamant that the tragedy won\u2019t be forgotten. Here, seven people tell their stories of that day. Dimitris Matrakides, 39, a software engineer, spent hours in the sea before being rescued by fishermen It\u2019s a very weird feeling running into the sea in your clothes. I was in the water for seven hours and, in all that time, I never took off my trainers or shorts. Bits of wood and metal were flying through the air, cars were going up in flames and gas bottles at the beach cafe were exploding, forcing us to wade further in. I went in up to my neck. Everyone was really frightened. When the fire first reached the waterfront, many of us in the sea turned round so that our backs were facing the coast. We just stood there, arms crossed, as big clumps of molten ash rained down. The noise was tremendous. There must have been 400 people who ran into the sea. Some of them had been sitting in their cars because of the gridlock, hoping to get out. I arrived at the beach at about 6.40pm \u2013 I had been looking for a mask and some money I had hidden in the roof of our house, which was later obliterated in the fire. But when I couldn\u2019t find the cash and saw the smoke, I ran. My wife, Eleni, had already got out by car with Michaelangelos, our son. My mother, Fotini, was on the beach with our neighbour, Margarita, and her six-month-old baby. He was crying uncontrollably. Margarita was panicking, her eyes were totally glazed and I remember helping to pull up her shirt so she could breastfeed him; but soon he became unconscious and I had to administer CPR. To this day I cannot understand why the army wasn\u2019t dispatched to get us on boats, when fishermen were defying the smoke and doing just that. A lot of people, especially kids, were struggling to keep afloat. Once, when all of us saw a light in the distance, we shouted: \u201cHelp!\u201d I called 112, the emergency telephone number. They said they would come to our rescue, but never did. I still haven\u2019t forgiven myself for not putting Margarita and the baby over my shoulders and doing more to get to a hospital. When we finally got them to an ambulance, it was [too] late. The baby died later that night, and Margarita a week later. I still have nightmares. I am always in the sea \u2013 my legs freezing in the cold, my torso frying in the heat. Alexis Andronopoulos, 50, an engineer, rescued 18 people I got on my motorbike at my office in Athens and headed to Mati at 6.30pm. I\u2019ve been a forest-fire volunteer for many years, but this time was different. My parents\u2019 summer home is there. I grew up with people who have apartments in the same block. They\u2019re all elderly now. I wanted to save them. It took me about 20 minutes to get there. I was stopped at the roadblock they\u2019d set up at the crossroads outside the town. I\u2019ll never forget the traffic policeman. He was adamant I was going nowhere. It was my first taste of state services. When, finally, I got in, at around 9pm, it was like a war zone, with cars and houses on fire, panic\u2011stricken people running up and down. Around the apartment block, a lot of vehicles were completely burnt out, just windows and wheels. Occasionally, something would explode. I was frightened and there was a moment when I thought: \u201cShould I stay or go?\u201d I found myself stepping over dead bodies as I approached the apartment building. Several corpses were sitting in cars. People who had remained in their apartments were, fortunately, saved; those who had moved from one flat to another were burned. It was hard to see in the smoke. The first woman I rescued was 80 and had just had a hip replacement. With some difficulty, I got her on the bike, saying: \u201cClose your eyes, hold me tight and don\u2019t think of anything.\u201d I took her up to the roadblock where another friend said her six-year-old daughter was trapped on the beach. I drove back and found her. I\u2019d seen a corpse in the alley leading to the shore, so led her through a garden on my way back. It was the only time I gave anyone my helmet. Again, I told her not to look. I did 18 runs, each time taking a person out and each time arguing with officers at the roadblock. I insisted it was safe to go in, but they kept saying they were under strict orders. Even an ambulance driver refused to use his walkie-talkie to ask for help. In Greece, nothing works and nobody cares. Special forces with anti-fire uniforms could have gone in earlier. The loss of life was greater because of the delayed response. For the past year, we\u2019ve been campaigning to help burn victims. The state didn\u2019t think about providing nurses for them, even when they were needed 24/7. Have lessons been learned? I don\u2019t think so. Authorities haven\u2019t even asked the basic question: how could 103 people die, 100 be injured, with not one fire-fighter among them? Kalli Anagnostou, 37, and her son, Constantinos, six, were severely burned in the fire It\u2019s as if the clock stopped at 6.30pm on 23 July. Even now, there are days when it feels as if we are back there. It was so violent, with explosions, corpses, cars, houses and trees on fire \u2013 and everywhere black, toxic smoke. We were holidaying at my in-laws\u2019 summer home. At the time, we lived in Dubai; now I joke that we left to escape the heat only to end up in the fire. That day we were taking it easy; I first heard the winds when I woke up from a siesta. I looked out of the window. There was smoke everywhere. Minutes later, I had grabbed my son, Constantinos, and was telling my father-in-law we had to leave. By the time we got out of the house, there were giant, two-metre-high flames barely two metres away. I remember looking back and seeing blackness. I didn\u2019t feel the flames. It was the heat that burned us \u2013 a thermal wave that preceded the fire. As we ran down the street, a neighbour came out of his house in a tiny car and we screamed at him to stop and take us. That saved us. Constantinos\u2019s flip-flops had melted. He was crying: \u201cMama, we\u2019re burning, Mama, we\u2019re burning.\u201d When we reached the port, a tourist appeared with a first-aid kit and bandaged his feet. There was a moment when I thought: \u201cThis is it, this is how it all ends.\u201d It\u2019s adrenaline that keeps you going. Somehow, my survival instinct prevailed. I was wearing Lycra leggings and a cotton top and had suffered fourth- and fifth-degree burns across 40% of my body, damaging several layers of my skin, muscle and nerves. After grafts, 80% of my body was affected. Constantinos was also severely burned. I was in a coma for three weeks while the doctors conducted plastic surgery. In total, I spent 67 days in hospital, 21 days in intensive care. Constantinos was in a trauma unit for 35 days and had daily skin-peeling procedures. I will need many more operations in the years ahead. Before the fire, I was an executive coach. Now, I am training to become a life coach, specialising in trauma. What happened was criminal and I am suing the government for negligence. Everything that was wrong with the Syriza government, the mistakes it made, its ineptitude, was exemplified by what happened here in Mati. It\u2019s not about the money. I see it more as an ethical issue; something I owe to my son. Tasos Gounarides, 47, a cake-shop owner, is still living in a military camp with his family after their home was destroyed We lost everything we ever owned. In minutes our house was gutted, our past erased. Every document and photo we ever had was lost to the flames. Still, we consider ourselves lucky. Damianos, my oldest, had broken his arm, so we were at the hospital in Evia when the fire erupted. With our home destroyed and nowhere else to go, the government put us in a summer camp that belongs to the air force, just outside Mati. It was meant to be a temporary solution, but 11 months later we are still there. There was talk of a rent subsidy, but those who were eligible said it stopped after two months. I didn\u2019t want to risk being out on the streets. Living in a two-room bungalow hasn\u2019t been easy, but what the fire has taught us is that less is more. The children have their own bedroom. We use ours as bedroom, kitchen, dining room and study. In winter, without any heating, it was cold and extremely damp. I have spent the past year gathering documents, going to lawyers, notaries and public offices so that I can prove that a house that is now a shell belongs to me. Each document comes at a cost. I must have spent \u20ac700 (\u00a3630) so far. Our home wasn\u2019t insured for fire. Not one official has visited us since the tragedy. After many weeks, Tsipras showed up, but he did so on a day when the media was on strike. Another time, he came at 6.30am so that nobody would see him. I\u2019ve heard \u20ac90m in private donations has been raised for Mati, but we haven\u2019t seen any of it. The only thing that seems to have been done is the clearing of charred trees. I\u2019m bothered that our memories have been extinguished. At times, I feel robbed. But situations like this make you stronger. I no longer make grandiose plans or get as anxious as I used to, and we\u2019ve become closer as a family. There are times when the past hits you. The other day, I found a picture on my phone of my neighbour, Emi, who drowned that night. I can\u2019t bring myself to erase her number. Weeks after the fire, as 18 volunteers were helping us remove debris from the house, we found my wedding ring under cement and broken roof tiles. I had been looking for it for over a year. It has our anniversary date engraved inside. It was a sign of a new beginning. Barbara Kasselouri, 51, a teacher and one of the last to escape by car, has since helped set up Mati\u2019s residents\u2019 committee What happened here exposed the rotten nature of the Greek state. People were being burned alive and our emergency services could not even attempt to protect them. As concerned residents, we\u2019ve set up a committee to look into the disaster. We\u2019ve made a map locating where people died. Most were outside their houses. Had they been evacuated, or warned by church bells or sirens, they could have been saved. Anyone who survived did so because of pure luck. I know I did. At 6.40pm, I was one of the last people out, driving the wrong way up Marathonas Avenue. My neighbour four doors down, her daughter and two grand-daughters all died. Her last words on the phone to a friend were: \u201cThe fire is coming, we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d I can\u2019t think of another country in Europe where the police, fire and emergency response services would be so disorganised. There\u2019s a fire hose right outside my house; it has never worked. That night, there wasn\u2019t a fire engine in sight, and no fire-fighting planes at all. I hear that police and firefighters were saying: \u201cWhy should we risk our lives when we only get paid \u20ac700 a month?\u201d It was the same even before the [economic] crisis. If you wanted the forest department to remove a dangerous tree \u2013 and there were a lot of them in these parts \u2013 you had to pay a bribe. Officials claim we\u2019re to blame because we prevented access to roads and built where we shouldn\u2019t have, without proper planning. It\u2019s become a line of defence to cover their own ineptitude. Over the years, houses like mine, which they now say are in forest land, have been legitimised by laws passed by a state that wanted to make money. If not, why did the government allow me to buy the house? Why did it accept \u20ac13,000 in taxes? It would take balls for any government to demolish everything that has been \u201cillegally\u201d built in this country. That\u2019s how Mati came to be created; that\u2019s why we now have a million \u201cillegal\u201d homes across Greece. Christiana Fragkou, 58, owns a property where 26 people were found dead the day after the fire We\u2019ve been called the owners of the House of Death; the couple who built illegally and cut off access to the sea. The truth is, people were burned alive because traffic police misdirected drivers down to the coastal road. They couldn\u2019t get to the sea, even on foot, because a tree blocking the nearest access alley went up in flames. In their panic, they ended up outside our property and that\u2019s when we opened the gates and let them through. But our plot ends at a cliff; there isn\u2019t a beach below, but there are rocks, accessed by some rough steps that my grandfather had carved into the cliff face.

Later, I learned there were 43 of us who outran the flames. I was still holding the cat cages as I ran down the cliff steps. I remember everyone panicking, tripping and falling, but somehow we made it to the rocks below. Suddenly, the sky changed and red-hot ash was raining down, burning the tips of my hair and bits of my body. I kept ducking under the water; a boat rescued us hours later. There are scenes that haunt me every day. I haven\u2019t been able to talk about it publicly until now. Knowing that so many people got trapped on the property, and died in the way they did, has been devastating. The earth is still black, but it has begun to sprout green shoots.

That night, the winds were up to 10 on the Beaufort scale, so it was very choppy. And there was smoke everywhere; visibility was nil. It was 7pm when I got the call from a lady who buys fish from me, saying: \u201cMohammed, we\u2019re on the beach at Kokkino Limanaki and we\u2019re either going to burn or drown. Save us!\u201d My kids said: \u201cDaddy, if there are children, you must go.\u201d I decided to leave instantly. There were four of us who set out to help, but I couldn\u2019t even see the boat in front of me. My biggest worry was hitting someone who might be struggling in the water, or a rock, or one of the other vessels. From Nea Makri, where my boat Elpida (which means Hope) is moored, it usually takes 30 minutes to get to that part of the coast; but given the circumstances it took us three times that. The others headed to the port in Mati. I headed to Kokkino Limanaki. As I pulled in, I saw all these people huddled together, holding one another. Thirty minutes later and I think they would have died in the heat. A lot couldn\u2019t swim. Children and their parents were the first to get on board \u2013 about 20 of them sitting anywhere they could, in the cabin, on the sides, all in a state of shock. We sailed to Rafina in total silence until we reached the port, where some cried. I returned with an official from the coastguard. That time, we brought back 28. The last was a woman, an old, very large lady, who was sitting on a rock. She didn\u2019t want to budge. Her back and legs were burnt. She kept saying: \u201cMy boy, I\u2019ve lost everything, let me die here.\u201d I kept saying: \u201cNo way, you\u2019re coming with us.\u201d I hurt my knee heaving her on to Elpida. I still don\u2019t know if she made it, but she is the one I can\u2019t forget. A few days later, my engine conked out. I couldn\u2019t work for a month. It cost me \u00a45,000 to replace it. I had to borrow the money and am still paying it off. Lots of people ask me what they can give me, because I saved their families. But how I can accept anything from people who\u2019ve lost everything? Prime minister Alexis Tsipras invited me and my family to his office. That was nice. I was granted Greek citizenship after my daughter, also called Elpida, asked Tsipras. I\u2019ve lived in Greece since the age of 17, when I left Egypt. But I\u2019ve still not received any compensation for the engine. I\u2019ve spoken to MPs about it. If someone asked me for help again, I\u2019d go. But if the state asked, I\u2019m not so sure. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "bodyText": "By the time British photographer Daniel Regan had turned 12, it was clear that he was different from his classmates. Home life was violent, chaotic and unstable; so much so that Regan struggled to communicate with words. So he picked up a camera that his grandfather had given him and started taking photographs instead. It was a move that would ultimately save his life. At first, the photos were a means of documenting the minutiae of everyday life \u2013 of giving permanence to the people, places and experiences that seemed fleeting and prone to disappearing at any time. Regan then turned the camera around to explore his own sense of self by photographing his skin and body. By his teens, when he was regularly self-harming, he used the photos of the cuts and scars \u2013 \u201cthe impact of the self-harm\u201d, as he describes it \u2013 as a way of sharing his feelings with his mother, a social worker with mental health difficulties of her own. Images from Insula (2003-2013), in which Regan documents the emotional difficulties of living with a chronic mental health disorder, as well as using photography as a tool for recovery \u201cI was a very quiet child and any time my mum tried to speak to me I\u2019d shut down,\u201d says Regan, 34, from his south London studio. \u201cI relied on the photographs to communicate with her in a way I felt less vulnerable.

      "bodyText": "Among the famous and the privileged taking part in this year\u2019s Magnolia Cup, Glorious Goodwood\u2019s charity race, will be an 18-year-old from Peckham with a determination to do things that are not expected of her. Just five months ago, the riding ambitions of Khadijah Mellah did not extend beyond occasional lessons at the Ebony Horse Club in Brixton but a week on Thursday she is expected to line up against former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, Irish model and TV presenter Vogue Williams, Apprentice series nine runner-up Luisa Zissman and others in a cavalry charge at the Sussex racecourse. It will be a huge moment for Khadijah, though she seemed full of poise on Friday as she was guided through the final stages of her training by two of her mentors, Hayley Turner and Oli Bell, the latter executive producer of a documentary film about the challenge she has taken on. It will also be a significant moment in British racing, as it is thought she will become the first jockey to wear a hijab in a race here. Such records are not kept but no one in officialdom can remember a precedent. Khadijah, who has tackled many different sports and is a black belt in karate, is a particular fan of the fundraising athlete Manal Rostom, founder of the women-only online support group Surviving Hijab. \u201cKhadijah sent her a message saying: \u2018You\u2019re an inspiration\u2019,\u201d Bell reports. \u201cShe told me, if one person messages me and says I\u2019m an inspiration, that would make me the proudest person.

But Carroll has always seemed to exist beyond the cold facts, an emblem of football as something more immediate and more emotional; a man out of his time from the start of his time, who might just have one last big scene left.",

      "body": "<p>It is the summer of 2019 and Colson Whitehead is sitting in midtown Manhattan thinking back to the birth of his new novel, <em>The Nickel Boys</em>. \u201cIt was 2014,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand it was a rough summer in terms of race and police brutality. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\" title=\"\">Michael Brown was shot</a> by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\" title=\"\">Eric Garner</a>, who was selling bootleg cigarettes in Staten Island, was choked to death by a cop. And no one was being held accountable. No one was being disciplined or going to jail. And then I came across Dozier School.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/22/a-type-of-justice-florida-reform-school-yields-evidence-of-more-graves\" title=\"\">Arthur G Dozier school</a>, more formally known as the Florida School for Boys, existed from 1900 to 2011 as a reform institution for youngsters deemed juvenile delinquents. Locally, and for much of its history, it was notorious for the beatings and torture meted out to students by whip-wielding staff. Many dozens died in mysterious circumstances and were buried in unmarked graves. Until the second half of the 60s, black and white boys were held in separate quarters. It took the efforts of former internees, known as the White House Boys, and the campaigning journalism of the Tampa Bay Times\u2019s Ben Montgomery for this dark history to come to light.</p> <p>\u201cI was shocked I\u2019d never heard about it \u2013 and shocked it wasn\u2019t getting more attention,\u201d Whitehead says. \u201cAnd then it dawned upon me: Michael Brown and Eric Garner are just a couple of examples of the many terrible incidents that are happening around us that we don\u2019t see. Dozier is one reform school; there are more. Then there\u2019s the tragic fact that no one cared. For a couple of decades, kids were coming forward. And nobody cared. Not even now: they were digging up bodies but it was just a one-day news story.\u201d</p> <p>In the 20 years since the publication of his first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/23/fiction.artsandhumanities\" title=\"\">The Intuitionist</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/23/fiction.artsandhumanities\" title=\"\"> </a>(1999), Whitehead has been a protean, rather slippery writer. His fictions are mordantly anthropological, often play with genres (crime, satire and, in the case of 2011\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/13/zone-one-colson-whitehead-review\" title=\"\">Zone One</a></em>, zombie horror), while his non-fiction books have dealt with post-9/11 Manhattan (<em>The Colossus of New York</em>) and the World Series of Poker (2014\u2019s <em>The Noble Hustle</em>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7aedd09cb6a9c4baef8ff5177dc719b38818542f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7aedd09cb6a9c4baef8ff5177dc719b38818542f/0_229_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cemetery of the former Arthur G Dozier School for Boys in Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cemetery of the former Arthur G Dozier School for Boys in Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Spooneybarger/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early on he was hailed by John Updike and won a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d fellowship in 2002, but it was the publication of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-review-american-slavery\" title=\"\">The Underground Railroad</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-review-american-slavery\" title=\"\"> </a>in 2016 that really made his name. A hybrid of historical and speculative fiction, it imagines the existence of a transport system that 19th-century black Americans could use to escape slavery. The novel was praised by Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey, sold more than a million copies, and won him both a National Book award and a Pulitzer prize. It is being adapted for Amazon by Barry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning director of <em>Moonlight</em>.</p> <p>Whitehead, who was born in 1969, wasn\u2019t always drawn to literary fiction. As a teenager he preferred video games and \u201changing around the house reading Marvel comics and Stephen King novels, and watching John Carpenter movies. I did think, as a profession, it would be cool to make up stories about robots and apocalyptic landscapes. And <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/07/twilight-zone-rod-serling\" title=\"\">The Twilight Zone</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/07/twilight-zone-rod-serling\" title=\"\"> </a>seems like a cool show: maybe I could get a job on <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. I wanted to write horror novels, novels about werewolves, and <em>Salem\u2019s Lot</em>-type towns taken over by vampires.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Nickel Boys</em>, like many novels about black American history, is a horror story, grotesque and gothic. Set in the 60s, it follows Elwood Curtis \u2013 young and idealistic \u2013 as he works diligently under the watch of his strict grandmother to win admission to a local college, only to have that future wrenched away from him because of an innocent mistake. He\u2019s whisked away to the \u201cNickel Academy\u201d where he does his best to resist being brutalised and hatches an escape plan with his cynical pal, Turner.</p> <p>\u201cYou can compare this case to what happened in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/irish-catholic-schools-child-abuse-claims\" title=\"\">Catholic orphanages</a> or in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/23/murdering-gully-settlers-killed-35-in-aboriginal-camp-and-threw-bodies-into-the-water\" title=\"\">aboriginal camps</a>,\u201d Whitehead observes. \u201cAny place where you have corrupt, malevolent authority figures who can exert their will on the innocent and powerless, then you\u2019re going to have this: the school as a plantation.\u201d The ease with which these metaphors connect slavery to the present day is, he believes, very telling. \u201cIn terms of institutional racism and segregation and white law enforcement attitude towards black people: you can say something from 1850 is true for now.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote about slave patrollers in <em>The Underground Railroad</em>, it was their job to stop any black person, free or slave, to check their papers. That\u2019s the same as \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 now. \u2018Show me your ID! What are you doing here?\u2019 It\u2019s policing black mobility.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>The Nickel Boys</em>, Elwood\u2019s dreams are partly inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/21/martin-luther-king-jr-day-legacy-radical\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a>, an LP of whose speeches he receives as a Christmas present. \u201cI wanted Elwood to be motivated by the spirit of the civil rights movement. Hearing King speak, you\u2019re struck by what an impossible figure he is. Maybe we created him out of necessity? How can someone so eloquent and wise and visionary survive as long as he did in this sort of crappy country? Of course they had to kill him.

Where does that come from? It\u2019s like an eight-minute song \u2026\u201d), and writes to a self-compiled playlist of over 2,000 tracks. He has a particular fondness for shapeshifters such as David Bowie and Prince. \u201cUp to the mid-80s, Bowie is changing persona with each album: you exhaust something and then try something new the next time out. That seems a natural lesson which I took in. With Prince, he\u2019s constantly saying \u2018fuck you\u2019 to those conventions about what you should be doing as an artist \u2013 or as a black artist. And hopefully I\u2019m taking that lesson and using elevators to talk about race \u2013 or writing a book like <em>The Colossus of New York</em> that\u2019s devoid of anything to do with race.\u201d</p> <p>Whitehead talks with affection about downtown New York in the 80s \u2013 \u201cit was a great time to be young in the city; the drinking age was not yet 21\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s particularly garrulous about the Village Voice, the countercultural weekly co-founded in 1955 by the English journalist John Wilcock, for which he wrote essays and television criticism in the 1990s. \u201cNowadays pop cultural criticism \u2013 the focus on identity and critiques of institutions \u2013 is everywhere,\u201d he observes. \u201cThe Village Voice made that possible.\u201d</p> <p>He was part of a constellation of writers \u2013 among them Greg Tate, J Hoberman, Hilton Als, Manohla Dargis \u2013 all of them theory-savvy, blase about the distinctions between high and low culture, and as enjoyable to read for their prose as for their opinions. \u201cThose writers had a multi-discipline expertise that was really inspiring. Everyone was broke at the same time. Everyone was about to find their voice. Everyone hung out and dated each other. That institutional tutelage was really important for me; I\u2019m not sure how it works now if you\u2019re working in your own home and working on some web thing and hoping to get noticed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He has been asked to go to Florida to talk about the Dozier boys but has so far refused. 'I\u2019m still angry and sad'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The success of <em>The Underground Railroad</em> means Whitehead himself no longer has to worry about getting noticed. Earlier this month he appeared on the cover of Time magazine. It sported the words US publications reserve as the ultimate praise: \u201cAmerica\u2019s storyteller\u201d. His daughter, now 14, is less easily impressed. \u201cI told her <em>Railroad</em> was a No 1 bestseller. She was like: \u2018Er\u2019. I said: Oprah picked it. \u2018Er\u2019. Then: I\u2019m gonna do a BuzzFeed interview tomorrow. \u2018BuzzFeed?!\u2019 That sort of made it real for her.\u201d</p> <p>Equally memorable was the time he encountered Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, the band whose records he worshipped as a teenager. \u201cI introduced myself nervously \u2013 like: \u2018Hi Thurston.\u2019 And he said: \u2018We love <em>John Henry Days</em>! We\u2019re reading it on the tour bus. We\u2019re underlining passages and reading parts aloud.\u2019 It was mind-blowing!\u201d</p> <p>Whitehead no longer needs to spend part of each year teaching creative writing classes. Instead he travels to different countries to meet new publishers. He admits that \u201cwith <em>Nickel Boys</em> I was writing on trains and planes and hotel rooms just because if I didn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t get done.\u201d (He has been asked to go to Florida to talk about the Dozier boys but has so far refused. \u201cI\u2019m still angry and sad. In terms of an exhumation, it\u2019s not my story; it\u2019s their story. I don\u2019t want to intrude upon that.\u201d)</p> <p>His publicity schedule means that his next book \u2013 a crime novel set in 60s Harlem that he\u2019s a third of the way through writing \u2013 is currently on hold. Recently he flipped through his second novel (<em>John Henry Days</em>) and found himself thinking: \u201cThis is pretty long. This is pretty dense. I could probably never do this now.\u201d He\u2019s been studying novellas, among them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/10/edithwharton\" title=\"\">Edith Wharton\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/10/edithwharton\" title=\"\">Ethan Frome</a></em>, as shorter fiction becomes more appealing.</p> <p>He would never begrudge his international commitments. If anything, they allow him to see his work in a new light. \u201cI was surprised with how well <em>The Underground Railroad</em> travelled. In Poland people told me: \u2018We connect abolitionism \u2013 hiding people, getting them to safety \u2013 to the Polish resistance against the Nazis.\u2019 The power dynamic between slave masters and slaves is like that between royalty and peasants \u2013 and that\u2019s global history, not just American history. But I don\u2019t really think about the audience: my motivation to write a book about two black boys in the 1960s just comes from the fact that, historically, America doesn\u2019t care about them.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Nickel Boys is published by Fleet (</em><em>16.99).

      "bodyText": "It is the summer of 2019 and Colson Whitehead is sitting in midtown Manhattan thinking back to the birth of his new novel, The Nickel Boys. \u201cIt was 2014,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand it was a rough summer in terms of race and police brutality. Michael Brown was shot by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner, who was selling bootleg cigarettes in Staten Island, was choked to death by a cop. And no one was being held accountable. No one was being disciplined or going to jail. And then I came across Dozier School.\u201d The Arthur G Dozier school, more formally known as the Florida School for Boys, existed from 1900 to 2011 as a reform institution for youngsters deemed juvenile delinquents. Locally, and for much of its history, it was notorious for the beatings and torture meted out to students by whip-wielding staff. Many dozens died in mysterious circumstances and were buried in unmarked graves. Until the second half of the 60s, black and white boys were held in separate quarters. It took the efforts of former internees, known as the White House Boys, and the campaigning journalism of the Tampa Bay Times\u2019s Ben Montgomery for this dark history to come to light. \u201cI was shocked I\u2019d never heard about it \u2013 and shocked it wasn\u2019t getting more attention,\u201d Whitehead says. \u201cAnd then it dawned upon me: Michael Brown and Eric Garner are just a couple of examples of the many terrible incidents that are happening around us that we don\u2019t see. Dozier is one reform school; there are more. Then there\u2019s the tragic fact that no one cared. For a couple of decades, kids were coming forward. And nobody cared. Not even now: they were digging up bodies but it was just a one-day news story.\u201d In the 20 years since the publication of his first novel, The Intuitionist (1999), Whitehead has been a protean, rather slippery writer. His fictions are mordantly anthropological, often play with genres (crime, satire and, in the case of 2011\u2019s Zone One, zombie horror), while his non-fiction books have dealt with post-9/11 Manhattan (The Colossus of New York) and the World Series of Poker (2014\u2019s The Noble Hustle). Early on he was hailed by John Updike and won a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d fellowship in 2002, but it was the publication of The Underground Railroad in 2016 that really made his name. A hybrid of historical and speculative fiction, it imagines the existence of a transport system that 19th-century black Americans could use to escape slavery. The novel was praised by Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey, sold more than a million copies, and won him both a National Book award and a Pulitzer prize. It is being adapted for Amazon by Barry Jenkins, the Oscar-winning director of Moonlight. Whitehead, who was born in 1969, wasn\u2019t always drawn to literary fiction. As a teenager he preferred video games and \u201changing around the house reading Marvel comics and Stephen King novels, and watching John Carpenter movies. I did think, as a profession, it would be cool to make up stories about robots and apocalyptic landscapes. And The Twilight Zone seems like a cool show: maybe I could get a job on The Twilight Zone. I wanted to write horror novels, novels about werewolves, and Salem\u2019s Lot-type towns taken over by vampires.\u201d The Nickel Boys, like many novels about black American history, is a horror story, grotesque and gothic. Set in the 60s, it follows Elwood Curtis \u2013 young and idealistic \u2013 as he works diligently under the watch of his strict grandmother to win admission to a local college, only to have that future wrenched away from him because of an innocent mistake. He\u2019s whisked away to the \u201cNickel Academy\u201d where he does his best to resist being brutalised and hatches an escape plan with his cynical pal, Turner. \u201cYou can compare this case to what happened in Catholic orphanages or in aboriginal camps,\u201d Whitehead observes. \u201cAny place where you have corrupt, malevolent authority figures who can exert their will on the innocent and powerless, then you\u2019re going to have this: the school as a plantation.\u201d The ease with which these metaphors connect slavery to the present day is, he believes, very telling. \u201cIn terms of institutional racism and segregation and white law enforcement attitude towards black people: you can say something from 1850 is true for now. \u201cI wrote about slave patrollers in The Underground Railroad, it was their job to stop any black person, free or slave, to check their papers. That\u2019s the same as \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 now. \u2018Show me your ID! What are you doing here?\u2019 It\u2019s policing black mobility.\u201d In The Nickel Boys, Elwood\u2019s dreams are partly inspired by Martin Luther King, an LP of whose speeches he receives as a Christmas present. \u201cI wanted Elwood to be motivated by the spirit of the civil rights movement. Hearing King speak, you\u2019re struck by what an impossible figure he is. Maybe we created him out of necessity? How can someone so eloquent and wise and visionary survive as long as he did in this sort of crappy country? Of course they had to kill him. All the civil rights protesters: they knew they would be faced by hoses and baseball bats and crowbars. And yet they got up and marched anyway? It\u2019s impossible \u2013 and also true.\u201d Perhaps it was his interest in comics (shared by authors such as Jonathan Lethem and Junot D\u00edaz), his energetic prose (notoriously criticised by James Wood), or the fact that he lived in Brooklyn (like almost every other New York writer), but Whitehead has regularly been said to be in sync with his times. In a review of his novel Sag Harbor (2009), about Smiths-listening black kids living the good life one long summer in Long Island, the critic Tour\u00e9 bracketed the writer as part of a cadre of \u201cpostblack\u201d figures \u2013 others included Kanye West, Questlove and Zadie Smith \u2013 who \u201ccan do blackness their way without fear of being branded pseudo or inconegro\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think of labels in that way,\u201d Whitehead argues. \u201cMy first book was about elevator inspectors. It\u2019s about race and cities \u2026 but using elevators. I\u2019ve always sort of tried to find a weird angle on something. When I wrote a zombie novel I didn\u2019t ask myself: should I be writing a zombie novel? I like zombies so I wrote a book about them. When I was writing The Underground Railroad I didn\u2019t think it was a historical fiction; I thought it was a novel that had some fantastic elements. \u201cHaving said that, right before The Underground Railroad I was planning to write a novel about new media culture, circa 2011; about the collapsing journalism model and the internet. Then I thought: maybe there\u2019s a really angry 27-year-old who can probably do it better than me? I\u2019m a paunchy fortysomething with a mortgage and kids.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI think the kind of fire I had to take on contemporary society is a bit diminished now.\u201d The Underground Railroad, about the pursuit of emancipation, was written in what Whitehead calls \u201cthe happier Obama days\u201d. The Nickel Boys he describes as his \u201cTrumpian novel\u201d. What does he mean? \u201cThe shifting of gears from Obama to Trump was pretty sudden. I\u2019m a big news junkie and when I started writing it in the spring of 2017 I was horrified \u2013 the Muslim [travel] ban, an FBI chief being fired, hate crimes on the rise.

Laughter and sadness cohabit in much of his work. \u201cI think the world is tragic and the world is funny,\u201d he declares. \u201cI grew up watching George Carlin and Richard Pryor with my parents at a very young age. They both veer between incredibly sad and totally slapstick. They\u2019re mugging \u2013 but also reaching for some elemental truth about what it is to be a person in a body on this planet.\u201d He cites Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man (1952), particularly a scene set at a boxing venue where a naked blonde woman with a tattoo of the American flag below her stomach provokes drooling chaos from the punters, as a perfect conjunction of the \u201cfunny and terrible. In Beckett and Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez too: there\u2019s a knowing wink at humanity\u2019s foibles. The Noble Hustle and Sag Harbor are more broad, but definitely in The Nickel Boys there\u2019s a gallows humour with the young boys trying to get whatever edge they can on their supervisors.\u201d As a child in Manhattan, Whitehead was called Arch. He later switched to Chipp, one of his middle names, and then to another, Colson. These name-changes are matched by a fondness for code and genre-switching; the roots of which perhaps lie in his adolescence. \u201cMy sister\u2019s a nurse now, but she was really into music. I\u2019d walk by her room and she\u2019d be playing Gang of Four and Grandmaster Flash. This cross-pollination between genres \u2013 reggae, dub, punk and hip-hop \u2013 all came together in a great moment from 1978 to 1984.

And you\u2019d just go up and down this five-storey club and find these different subcultures all hanging out with each other. \u201cWhen I heard Planet Rock by Afrika Bambaataa I recognised the sample from Trans-Europe Express by Kraftwerk.

And hopefully I\u2019m taking that lesson and using elevators to talk about race \u2013 or writing a book like The Colossus of New York that\u2019s devoid of anything to do with race.\u201d Whitehead talks with affection about downtown New York in the 80s \u2013 \u201cit was a great time to be young in the city; the drinking age was not yet 21\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s particularly garrulous about the Village Voice, the countercultural weekly co-founded in 1955 by the English journalist John Wilcock, for which he wrote essays and television criticism in the 1990s. \u201cNowadays pop cultural criticism \u2013 the focus on identity and critiques of institutions \u2013 is everywhere,\u201d he observes. \u201cThe Village Voice made that possible.\u201d He was part of a constellation of writers \u2013 among them Greg Tate, J Hoberman, Hilton Als, Manohla Dargis \u2013 all of them theory-savvy, blase about the distinctions between high and low culture, and as enjoyable to read for their prose as for their opinions. \u201cThose writers had a multi-discipline expertise that was really inspiring. Everyone was broke at the same time. Everyone was about to find their voice. Everyone hung out and dated each other. That institutional tutelage was really important for me; I\u2019m not sure how it works now if you\u2019re working in your own home and working on some web thing and hoping to get noticed.\u201d The success of The Underground Railroad means Whitehead himself no longer has to worry about getting noticed. Earlier this month he appeared on the cover of Time magazine. It sported the words US publications reserve as the ultimate praise: \u201cAmerica\u2019s storyteller\u201d. His daughter, now 14, is less easily impressed. \u201cI told her Railroad was a No 1 bestseller. She was like: \u2018Er\u2019. I said: Oprah picked it. \u2018Er\u2019. Then: I\u2019m gonna do a BuzzFeed interview tomorrow. \u2018BuzzFeed?!\u2019 That sort of made it real for her.\u201d Equally memorable was the time he encountered Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, the band whose records he worshipped as a teenager. \u201cI introduced myself nervously \u2013 like: \u2018Hi Thurston.\u2019 And he said: \u2018We love John Henry Days! We\u2019re reading it on the tour bus. We\u2019re underlining passages and reading parts aloud.\u2019 It was mind-blowing!\u201d Whitehead no longer needs to spend part of each year teaching creative writing classes. Instead he travels to different countries to meet new publishers. He admits that \u201cwith Nickel Boys I was writing on trains and planes and hotel rooms just because if I didn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t get done.\u201d (He has been asked to go to Florida to talk about the Dozier boys but has so far refused. \u201cI\u2019m still angry and sad. In terms of an exhumation, it\u2019s not my story; it\u2019s their story. I don\u2019t want to intrude upon that.\u201d) His publicity schedule means that his next book \u2013 a crime novel set in 60s Harlem that he\u2019s a third of the way through writing \u2013 is currently on hold. Recently he flipped through his second novel (John Henry Days) and found himself thinking: \u201cThis is pretty long. This is pretty dense. I could probably never do this now.\u201d He\u2019s been studying novellas, among them Edith Wharton\u2019s Ethan Frome, as shorter fiction becomes more appealing. He would never begrudge his international commitments. If anything, they allow him to see his work in a new light. \u201cI was surprised with how well The Underground Railroad travelled. In Poland people told me: \u2018We connect abolitionism \u2013 hiding people, getting them to safety \u2013 to the Polish resistance against the Nazis.\u2019 The power dynamic between slave masters and slaves is like that between royalty and peasants \u2013 and that\u2019s global history, not just American history. But I don\u2019t really think about the audience: my motivation to write a book about two black boys in the 1960s just comes from the fact that, historically, America doesn\u2019t care about them.\u201d \u2022 The Nickel Boys is published by Fleet (16.99).

A big breakthrough came with the Iraq inquiry in late 2009, when we led the website with my inquiry blog, rather than a conventional news story, for days on end. I remember it as the moment when editors became comfortable with the idea of anchoring web coverage around a blog.

The chat in the office was often more stimulating than what we were publishing.

Partly that\u2019s because space is unlimited. But mostly it\u2019s a matter of having more elbow room as a journalist.

I\u2019ve been writing the live blog for almost 10 years and it\u2019s never had such a big readership: 1m-plus hits a day on average in the first quarter of the year, when the Brexit crisis was acute. It\u2019s less now, but the blog is almost always one of the five most read articles on the website on any day, and quite often it\u2019s the best read.</p> <p>You need three things for a live blog to work: what I call \u201cnow news\u201d (that is, news you want to read immediately, not over breakfast tomorrow); a story that keeps changing; and a story that people want to read at length. Brexit ticks all these boxes.</p> <h2>Do you worry that you just don\u2019t have time to analyse properly what\u2019s going on?</h2> <p>A bit. If you have six hours to think about a politician\u2019s speech, you will produce a more considered view than you can in 20-30 minutes (my timeframe \u2013 I write a lot of \u201csnap verdicts\u201d). But there is an intense demand for instant news and, if we don\u2019t meet it, someone else will. There is a famous 19th<sup> </sup>century Times editorial saying the first duty of the press is to obtain \u201cthe earliest and most correct intelligence of the events of the time\u201d and, by disclosing them, make them \u201cthe common property of the nation\u201d. That still stands; it is just that \u201cearliest\u201d is quicker than it used to be. I also think the assumption \u201cfast news must be flawed\u201d is wrong: sometimes the quickest takes are the sharpest.</p> <h2>What do your readers contribute to your blog?</h2> <p>More than they probably realise. My blog regularly attracts 10,000 or more comments a day. I can\u2019t read them all, but I read some and I try to reply to anyone who asks me a direct question (by wordsearching \u201cAndrew\u201d).</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m giving away any trade secrets if I say not all journalists welcome being told they\u2019re wrong. Who does? But the live blog format makes it possible to have a very constructive relationship with readers. Once a reporter files a story, it\u2019s over, and any non-positive feedback counts as a complaint. But my blog is open for eight or more hours a day, and when people point out mistakes, or challenge my judgment, there is time for me to respond.</p> <p>In my book, no error is too minor to correct (if you care about getting the small things right, you\u2019re more likely to get the big things right too) and if people question my analysis or language, as long as they\u2019re not offensive, I\u2019m happy to consider their point. Over time I\u2019ve realised this scrutiny makes me a much better reporter. I spend around 20 minutes a day reading and replying to comments, and it\u2019s a part of my routine I always find illuminating.</p> <p><br></p>",

I also think the assumption \u201cfast news must be flawed\u201d is wrong: sometimes the quickest takes are the sharpest. What do your readers contribute to your blog? More than they probably realise. My blog regularly attracts 10,000 or more comments a day. I can\u2019t read them all, but I read some and I try to reply to anyone who asks me a direct question (by wordsearching \u201cAndrew\u201d). I don\u2019t think I\u2019m giving away any trade secrets if I say not all journalists welcome being told they\u2019re wrong. Who does? But the live blog format makes it possible to have a very constructive relationship with readers. Once a reporter files a story, it\u2019s over, and any non-positive feedback counts as a complaint. But my blog is open for eight or more hours a day, and when people point out mistakes, or challenge my judgment, there is time for me to respond. In my book, no error is too minor to correct (if you care about getting the small things right, you\u2019re more likely to get the big things right too) and if people question my analysis or language, as long as they\u2019re not offensive, I\u2019m happy to consider their point. Over time I\u2019ve realised this scrutiny makes me a much better reporter. I spend around 20 minutes a day reading and replying to comments, and it\u2019s a part of my routine I always find illuminating.",

Pinto imagines the nature of the relationship that develops between the 29-year\u2011old Sri Lankan and the ageing pioneer of urban modernism. She gives them trysts, meaningful exchanges, a separation and then painful longing, ending only with Le Corbusier\u2019s death in 1965.</p> <p>Pinto luxuriates in their imagined love affair, revelling in the anguish of their estrangement. It\u2019s hard not to be swept away by it all, although she never makes clear exactly how closely she cleaves to real life.

It\u2019s here that Pinto bestows on her heroine the fervour of a modernist visionary, conveying how urgently De Silva understood the functional urbanism that a new Sri Lanka would need, how quickly it must be built and how beautiful it might be. Pinto is at her best when she takes us beyond the romantic agony into the design aesthetics. She shows us De Silva\u2019s sense of invention, her determination to meld modernist architecture with traditional craftsmanship, her insistence that a built structure should have some relation to the rocky landscape into which it would be cut. In this way, the novel seeks to give voice to De Silva\u2019s distinctive architectural vision, countering Le Corbusier\u2019s propensity for grand pronouncements on urban planning and the \u201cpoetry of the right angle\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/dec/14/minnette-de-silva-the-brilliant-female-architect-forgotten-by-history\">Minnette de Silva: the brilliant female architect forgotten by history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book is most valuable for its portrait of De Silva \u2013 a woman so unquestionably intelligent and intriguing that it feels scandalous she should be so little known.

I was on a good run of spin-biking and eating sensibly, then I had an injury that meant I couldn\u2019t exercise for <em>a day</em> and I have allowed this to throw me completely off course. I\u2019m eating as if preparing for hibernation. The most exercise I have done in the past fortnight is move a box of toys from in front of our freezer. I am in deep trouble.</p> <p>I have written previously in this column that my weight-loss aspirations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/18/romesh-ranganathan-new-exercise-bike-nightmare\" title=\"\">are all about health</a>; I was lying.

The other day, after we had been swimming, he was handed a foil blanket to warm up and he made it look so good he could have attended an awards do in it.</p> <p>The truth is, social media is brutal. Whenever a photo is posted of me alongside my slimmer and more handsome co-stars, people make comments such as, \u201cOh my God, they look so good, obviously not Romesh, bless him! ;-)\u201d Or, \u201cGosh, I\u2019m getting all hot and flustered, had to look at Romesh to calm down.\u201d Now, I\u2019m not entitled enough to think I should be getting comments about being attractive, but it does exert a bit of pressure to shift some timber.</p> <p>Weirdly, I can\u2019t figure out if that pressure is what threw me off course. I lost a bit of weight before starting to film the current series of A League Of Their Own and had been told by a number of friends that I was looking good. Having seen myself next to people who are in genuinely good shape, I now realise that what these friends were saying was, \u201cYou looked really shit before.\u201d</p> <p>The truth is, I deserve to be overweight. I am so greedy. I promise myself I\u2019m not going to eat crap, but then I get home from a gig and think, \u201cYou deserve a treat,\u201d and eat like a man who thinks his treat should be type 2 diabetes.

It could go either way. I\u2019m at a fork in the road, and I mustn\u2019t use that fork to eat cake.</p> <p>So, I begin again.

      "bodyText": "I have fallen so hard off the weight-loss wagon that I fear if I get back on I might be so heavy that I\u2019ll break it. I was on a good run of spin-biking and eating sensibly, then I had an injury that meant I couldn\u2019t exercise for a day and I have allowed this to throw me completely off course. I\u2019m eating as if preparing for hibernation. The most exercise I have done in the past fortnight is move a box of toys from in front of our freezer. I am in deep trouble. I have written previously in this column that my weight-loss aspirations are all about health; I was lying. There is so much vanity to this. I do quite a bit of television work with Jamie Redknapp, who makes any outfit look amazing. The other day, after we had been swimming, he was handed a foil blanket to warm up and he made it look so good he could have attended an awards do in it. The truth is, social media is brutal. Whenever a photo is posted of me alongside my slimmer and more handsome co-stars, people make comments such as, \u201cOh my God, they look so good, obviously not Romesh, bless him! ;-)\u201d Or, \u201cGosh, I\u2019m getting all hot and flustered, had to look at Romesh to calm down.\u201d Now, I\u2019m not entitled enough to think I should be getting comments about being attractive, but it does exert a bit of pressure to shift some timber. Weirdly, I can\u2019t figure out if that pressure is what threw me off course. I lost a bit of weight before starting to film the current series of A League Of Their Own and had been told by a number of friends that I was looking good. Having seen myself next to people who are in genuinely good shape, I now realise that what these friends were saying was, \u201cYou looked really shit before.\u201d The truth is, I deserve to be overweight. I am so greedy. I promise myself I\u2019m not going to eat crap, but then I get home from a gig and think, \u201cYou deserve a treat,\u201d and eat like a man who thinks his treat should be type 2 diabetes. I wake up with the intentions of an Olympic athlete, then inhale three sandwiches before I\u2019ve even registered them. I\u2019m facing the slump \u2013 the commonest, yet most underreported part of trying to get healthy and fit. There are loads of stories written about the start, and the finish, the bit when you have achieved all your goals; but there\u2019s nothing about the bit in the middle when you lose momentum and sit in your pants eating Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, watching Netflix, while occasionally catching your reflection and shuddering \u2013 which drives you to eat more ice-cream. I imagine that\u2019s what happens, anyway. It could go either way. I\u2019m at a fork in the road, and I mustn\u2019t use that fork to eat cake. So, I begin again. Next week, I\u2019ll start exercising again and eating like a normal human. I\u2019m going to stick with it, I promise, and in years to come I\u2019ll write a column with the tagline: \u201cPeople keep telling me how ripped I am and it\u2019s starting to get annoying.\u201d For now, however, I have just one fitness goal \u2013 to post a photo on social media without somebody saying: \u201cHaha Romesh\u2019s fat belly is hilarious!\u201d I\u2019ll keep you updated.",

The number one reason for cat owners claiming on insurer Direct Line\u2019s policies last year was gastro-related illnesses.</p> <p>When my cats recently turned their noses up at Whiskas, I mentioned it on Twitter, and the company replied that this may be linked to the fact that it had made some changes to its recipe.</p> <p>It says: \u201cWe\u2019ve made the gravy and jelly much thicker and enhanced the appearance, making each recipe more distinctive across the different varieties. We have also ensured that the balance of minerals support a healthy urinary tract.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, it said cats naturally seek variety in their foods, \u201cwhich is why we regularly change our recipes\u201d.</p> <p>While Oscar and Dennis are undeniably spoilt, I\u2019m not ready to pay almost \u00a31 per meal.

Since then, I\u2019ve been trialling brands to find a diet that\u2019s healthy but not too expensive. The options are endless, from grain-free to raw meat, but how much does what I\u2019m giving them affect their health? One in 20 of us buy the cheapest on offer, and 64% of cat owners have no idea what they should be looking for in the ingredients, according to a study from premium pet food brand Lily\u2019s Kitchen. South London vet Dr Rory Cowlam told me that as cats are carnivores, it is important they get high meat content, and this should be the first thing I look for. He says dry food is generally cheaper, easier to keep and better for cats\u2019 teeth. \u201cIt is a common misconception that cats need a mix of dry and wet.

Some dry food can work out at around 40p a portion \u2013 less than the premium brands \u2013 and while it can cost slightly more than budget options, the meat quantity is often higher. Clare Hamilton, a vet in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, says that when it comes to supermarket brands, \u201cthere are far too many own-brands of varying quality and price\u201d. She adds: \u201cThe most important thing is to look at its contents and go for the highest quality you can afford, whether that is organic, supermarket or a scientific brand.\u201d Henrietta Morrison, founder of Lily\u2019s Kitchen, reckons most foods are made with fillers such as grains, bone meal, sugars and flavourings, so there is little actual meat. This is why she started the brand, and says customers report their cats behaving better on it, along with having better digestion and overall health. The Lily\u2019s range contains 65% meat, whereas many leading brands would appear to be a lot lower \u2013 though it can be hard to tell, as labelling is sometimes far from clear. For example, on the ingredients panel of a standard sachet of Whiskas chicken in gravy, the first thing listed is \u201cmeat and animal derivatives (38%, of which 94% natural, including 4% chicken)\u201d.

A typical sachet of Felix chicken in jelly says the ingredients are \u201cmeat and animal derivatives (of which chicken 4%), fish and fish derivatives, minerals, various sugars\u201d. Four per cent seems to be a common figure when it comes to the meat or fish stated on the packet. However, if you want to ensure your cat is \u201conly getting the good stuff,\u201d as Morrison puts it, you can expect to pay quite a bit more. With Whiskas or Felix wet food, for example, you might be looking at around 25p for 100g sachet in a box of 12, while a standard 85g individual serving from Lily\u2019s Kitchen might set you back around 84p in a multipack.

In fact, Cats Protection (formerly the Cats Protection League) says there are no clinical studies to argue it is better than cooked. \u201cShop-bought raw food is not the same as a freshly killed rodent or bird, particularly as it is likely to have been refrigerated or frozen,\u201d it says. \u201cCats in the wild eat the entire animal, so just feeding chicken breasts or similar will not meet all its nutritional needs. \u201cThere is also an increased risk of infections such as E coli, salmonella and campylobacter, which can cause disease in cats and serious illness in humans \u2013 and the potential link between raw food and TB is a further concern.\u201d Cowlam told me a bad diet can lead to many problems including obesity, heart, liver or kidney disease, cystitis, or poor growth and development. The number one reason for cat owners claiming on insurer Direct Line\u2019s policies last year was gastro-related illnesses. When my cats recently turned their noses up at Whiskas, I mentioned it on Twitter, and the company replied that this may be linked to the fact that it had made some changes to its recipe. It says: \u201cWe\u2019ve made the gravy and jelly much thicker and enhanced the appearance, making each recipe more distinctive across the different varieties. We have also ensured that the balance of minerals support a healthy urinary tract.\u201d In a statement, it said cats naturally seek variety in their foods, \u201cwhich is why we regularly change our recipes\u201d. While Oscar and Dennis are undeniably spoilt, I\u2019m not ready to pay almost \u00a31 per meal. But to avoid more vet bills, they are going to have to settle for a dry food with a higher percentage of meat or fish \u2013 and less additional ingredients \u2013 and, of course, the occasional treat.",

So if one of those thousands of home loans is yours, you might want to start thinking about looking for a new deal now \u2013 particularly as you may be able to make a chunky saving on your monthly payments. Yorkshire building society \u2013 which came up with the figure after analysing market data \u2013 says some homeowners whose deals are coming to an end this autumn could save about \u00a3200 a month by remortgaging. That is partly as a result of the current competitive mortgage rates, but also reflects the rise in house prices across much of the UK during the last few years. Mark Harris at mortgage broker SPF Private Clients says: \u201cThose coming off five-year fixes will find that rates are now considerably cheaper, which should mean you can make a significant saving on your monthly payments.\u201d He adds: \u201cYou may also find that your property has appreciated in value, meaning you qualify for a lower, cheaper, loan-to-value [LTV] band.\u201d Official Land Registry data shows that the average UK house price in October 2014 was \u00a3191,855, and had risen to \u00a3229,431 by May this year (the latest month for which figures are available) \u2013 an increase of just under 20%.

      "body": "<h2><strong>North </strong><strong>York Moors</strong></h2> <p>Is there a more thunderously wonderful view from an English campsite than the one enjoyed from <strong>Park Farm</strong>? This tiny sloping triangle of grass on the edge of the North York Moors lords it over a sumptuous expanse of English countryside. It\u2019s roughly 50 miles west to Tan Hill and the Dales and, on a clear day, you can see absolutely everything in between: a joyous swoop of fields, trees and yet more hills. <a href=\"https://www.greatenglishtrails.com/en_GB/trails/cleveland-way/\" title=\"\">The Cleveland Way</a> passes across the 700-acre farm, making the campsite an ideal base from which to follow the long-distance footpath up to the Matterhorn-like Roseberry Topping and Captain Cook\u2019s Monument on Easby Moor. Cooking-apple trees provide some shelter and shade (and pectin if the visit is timed right). And for those who prefer their tents made of sterner stuff than rip-stop nylon, there\u2019s a fine stone camping barn with its own wood-burning stove, and a former byre with real beds. But that means missing the view\u2026<br><strong>Getting there</strong><em> </em>Take the train to Kildale, on the line from Middlesbrough to Whitby.

The camping meadow is kept blissfully vehicle-free and since there are just 14 pitches, it\u2019s never crowded. Bert\u2019s is a <a href=\"http://greenercamping.org/\" title=\"\">Greener Camping Club</a> site, so there are \u201cluxury\u201d compost toilets and eco-friendly toiletries provided gratis. There\u2019s also free tea, coffee and hot chocolate on tap; homemade cakes and local ice-cream for sale in the camp shop; and croissants and cakes served in the cafe.

Many years later, the peaceful <strong>North Rhinns Camping</strong> is a lovely warren of secluded pitches carved out of the grove. There are great views on the western side and from the top of the campsite you can see the hills of Northern Ireland, 25 miles away. The nearby <a href=\"http://dg.wildseasons.co.uk/locations/aldouran-wetland-garden-leswalt-stranraer/204\" title=\"\">Aldouran Wetland Garden</a> in Leswalt has a hide from which to watch birds and red squirrels.

The little 20-tent field is protected by woodland and has a calming view up to a grassy hill. For those who seriously want to get away from it all, there\u2019s a secluded pitch in the small disused quarry from which stone was hewn to build the farmhouse. Campers are encouraged to visit the 16-acre biodynamic smallholding and get to know the livestock \u2013 chickens, sheep and amiable Tamworth sows. But should you care to roam abroad, <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/croft-castle-and-parkland\" title=\"\">Croft Castle</a> is just three miles away, while the 30-mile <a href=\"http://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Mortimer+Trail\" title=\"\">Mortimer Trail</a> runs through nearby Aymestry.<br><strong>Getting there</strong> Take a train to Leominster and then Lugg Valley Travel\u2019s <a href=\"https://bustimes.org/services/496-leominster-pembridge-circular\" title=\"\">496 bus</a> to Mortimer\u2019s Cross, from where it\u2019s a five-minute walk to the campsite.

It offers a space for \u201celemental living, personal reflection and a recharging of batteries\u201d. Squads of red squirrels patrol the little glade that serves as a camping area, on which no more than four small tents are permitted. There are hammocks strung between trees and, with a chimenea and log seats to hand as well, it would be rude not to relax under the stars, having enjoyed the dry sauna and wood-fired hot tub first, of course. Over the past four decades, a range of rustic rental accommodation has appeared: a tiny mountain hut-style hostel, a woodman\u2019s hut, a converted lambing bothy and a little lodge overlooking a stream, on which play the eponymous ducks.<br><strong>Getting there</strong> Jump out at Carrbridge or Aviemore on the Perth to Inverness line.

There are enough sporting facilities on site to stage your own mini-Olympics: volleyball, football, badminton, table football, table tennis and p\u00e9tanque, as well as the lake for a cooling dip. The Haute Maurienne is a wild place of forests, meadows, lakes and streams, and a broad range of flora and fauna. It all makes for great hiking country but there\u2019s also via ferrata, mountain biking and paragliding on offer. The village contains some useful shops and a bar/restaurant, while bread, hot and cold drinks and ice-cream are sold on site. And if you want to leave the tent at home, there are yurts, tipis and cabins.<br><strong>Getting there</strong> Take a <a href=\"https://en.oui.sncf/en/\" title=\"\">direct TGV</a> from Paris Gare de Lyon for the four-hour journey to Modane from where a <a href=\"https://altibus.com/\" title=\"\">bus</a> will speed you to Solli\u00e8res-Sardi\u00e8res.<br>\u2022 <em>Pitch \u20ac5-\u20ac7.50 plus adult \u20ac4, child \u20ac2.50, yurts and cabins from \u20ac60-120 a night (weekly rates cheaper), <a href=\"http://camping-lechenantier.com/\" title=\"\">camping-lechenantier.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Azun Nature, France</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c09a7b12ee08e29bc4a73d30d65e60432b2554a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c09a7b12ee08e29bc4a73d30d65e60432b2554a/5_123_3460_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Azun Nature, Aucun, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The <strong>Azun Nature</strong> campsite near Aucun (13 miles south of Lourdes) is in the remarkably attractive Val d\u2019Azun, blending into its picturesque surroundings with trees, rocks and shrubs acting as the boundaries between its two dozen camping pitches. There are shower and toilet facilities for disabled campers and a refuge containing a small library. The campsite is also a certified sanctuary for birds: the owners can supply binoculars and guides on the local avian life, and also lay on organised ornithological walks in July and August. But where this little Eden really wins is with its unpretentious spa \u2013 a sauna is complemented by two spacious wooden hot tubs on a terrace outside from where you can watch the stars while you soak.<br><strong>Getting there</strong> Before 4pm on the day before your arrival, ring the on-demand bus service (+33 4 68 80 80 80) to arrange the bus to pick you up from Argel\u00e8s-Gazost-Cord\u00e9e railway station and drop you at the campsite near Aucun (fare \u20ac1).

The Three Peaks \u2013 Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau \u2013 are just across the valley, and at over 1,000 metres above sea level, this is a great place to fill your lungs with mountain air. There\u2019s plenty of sunshine too \u2013 Beatenberg is acknowledged as the sun terrace of the Berner Oberland. The village is home to little restaurants and a swimming pool, while further afield there\u2019s the St Beatus hiking trail and tandem paragliding to try out. <strong>Camping-Ferien Wang</strong> has just 28 pitches, spread out over a prime slice of Swiss greensward, and in summer the local baker makes a daily delivery of bread fresh from the oven, so you might not want to leave at all.<br><strong>Getting there</strong> Take the <a href=\"https://www.sbb.ch/en/\" title=\"\">train to Interlaken</a> West then board the <a href=\"https://www.postauto.ch/en/excursion-tips/route-beatenberg\" title=\"\">101 post bus </a>for the climb up to Beatenberg.

Simply pack a tent and head for this recently opened campsite on the Cavallino-Treporti peninsula, a mere 40-minute ferry ride from La Serenissima\u2019s bright lights and gondolas. <strong>Agricampeggio da Scarpa</strong> is a project of the farming/inn-keeping Scarpa family whose declared aim is \u201cto combine love for the land with warm hospitality for tourists\u201d. The fruits of their love for the land are on sale on site too. It\u2019s 500 metres to a blue flag beach where the annual Beach on Fire firework display is held at the end of August. From the Punta Sabbioni pier that serves the campsite from Venice, there are also direct sailings to the islands of Burano and Murano, which makes for very easy day-tripping.<br><strong>Getting there</strong> From the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station, head across town to the S Marco-S Zaccaria \u2018A\u2019 pier to <a href=\"http://actv.avmspa.it/en/content/orari-servizio-di-navigazione-0\" title=\"\">take a Line 14 or 15 ferry</a> for the 40-minute sailing to Punta Sabbioni.

It\u2019s also set in an orchard of a country house whose apple, fig, pear and nut trees give ample shade when the temperature rises. And with numbers limited to just 16 campers, tranquility is more or less assured. Bocairent is a short walk away \u2013 it\u2019s a town of small squares, cobbled streets and fountains with a selection of bars and restaurants serving traditional Valencian dishes. The town\u2019s Las Danzas festival takes place from 23-27 August every year, with performances of centuries-old dances and rites in the main square late each evening, followed by a daytime procession on 28 August to honour Sant Agust\u00ed.<br><strong>Getting there</strong> Take the train to Valencia and pick up the <a href=\"http://www.laconcepcion.net/linea.aspx?idLineaRegular=33\" title=\"\">Valencia-Ontinyent-Banyeres bus</a> for the 1\u00be-hour trip to Bocairent.

In a little under two acres it fits in ponds, a bright airy cafe serving up breakfast, coffee and homemade cakes, and modern facilities with full access for disabled campers. The site\u2019s proximity to Freiburg makes a visit to the medieval city and its extraordinary <a href=\"https://freiburgermuenster.info/\" title=\"\">gothic cathedral</a> a must. A climb of the Schlossberg hill and the terrifying viewing tower at its summit is also in order.

It\u2019s eco-friendly too \u2013 all the campsite\u2019s electricity comes from a hydro-scheme. The Rhine is just around the corner, making the campsite a good base for cruises along the river and hikes along the three main Rhineland trails: the <a href=\"https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Rheinburgenweg\" title=\"\">Rheinburgenweg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rheinsteig.de/en/the-rheinsteig/home/\" title=\"\">Rheinsteig</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Wine_Trail\" title=\"\">Rotweinwanderweg</a>. The path up to the viewing point at Reutersley starts right at the campsite too. Bad Breisig is a spa town of many festivals and food-related events; the 46th annual culinary festival takes place from 19-28 July this year.

They run a cute little alfresco bar, and there\u2019s a bijou swimming pool amid lush vegetation with views of the woodland beyond. Each morning, you can buy eggs laid by the resident hens and freshly baked bread. The village of Pelinos is typical of the area and worth a wander around, while medieval Tomar is just four miles away.

This tiny sloping triangle of grass on the edge of the North York Moors lords it over a sumptuous expanse of English countryside. It\u2019s roughly 50 miles west to Tan Hill and the Dales and, on a clear day, you can see absolutely everything in between: a joyous swoop of fields, trees and yet more hills. The Cleveland Way passes across the 700-acre farm, making the campsite an ideal base from which to follow the long-distance footpath up to the Matterhorn-like Roseberry Topping and Captain Cook\u2019s Monument on Easby Moor. Cooking-apple trees provide some shelter and shade (and pectin if the visit is timed right). And for those who prefer their tents made of sterner stuff than rip-stop nylon, there\u2019s a fine stone camping barn with its own wood-burning stove, and a former byre with real beds. But that means missing the view\u2026 Getting there Take the train to Kildale, on the line from Middlesbrough to Whitby.

The camping meadow is kept blissfully vehicle-free and since there are just 14 pitches, it\u2019s never crowded. Bert\u2019s is a Greener Camping Club site, so there are \u201cluxury\u201d compost toilets and eco-friendly toiletries provided gratis. There\u2019s also free tea, coffee and hot chocolate on tap; homemade cakes and local ice-cream for sale in the camp shop; and croissants and cakes served in the cafe. There are yoga sessions in the barn, and also daily meditation, reiki and aromatherapy massage on offer. And, of course, there\u2019s a pop-up art gallery. What self-respecting campsite doesn\u2019t have one of those nowadays?

Many years later, the peaceful North Rhinns Camping is a lovely warren of secluded pitches carved out of the grove. There are great views on the western side and from the top of the campsite you can see the hills of Northern Ireland, 25 miles away. The nearby Aldouran Wetland Garden in Leswalt has a hide from which to watch birds and red squirrels. And ornithologists staying here will be thrilled to learn that large numbers of Britain\u2019s smallest bird, the goldcrest, flit above the tents.

The little 20-tent field is protected by woodland and has a calming view up to a grassy hill. For those who seriously want to get away from it all, there\u2019s a secluded pitch in the small disused quarry from which stone was hewn to build the farmhouse. Campers are encouraged to visit the 16-acre biodynamic smallholding and get to know the livestock \u2013 chickens, sheep and amiable Tamworth sows. But should you care to roam abroad, Croft Castle is just three miles away, while the 30-mile Mortimer Trail runs through nearby Aymestry. Getting there Take a train to Leominster and then Lugg Valley Travel\u2019s 496 bus to Mortimer\u2019s Cross, from where it\u2019s a five-minute walk to the campsite.

It offers a space for \u201celemental living, personal reflection and a recharging of batteries\u201d. Squads of red squirrels patrol the little glade that serves as a camping area, on which no more than four small tents are permitted. There are hammocks strung between trees and, with a chimenea and log seats to hand as well, it would be rude not to relax under the stars, having enjoyed the dry sauna and wood-fired hot tub first, of course. Over the past four decades, a range of rustic rental accommodation has appeared: a tiny mountain hut-style hostel, a woodman\u2019s hut, a converted lambing bothy and a little lodge overlooking a stream, on which play the eponymous ducks. Getting there Jump out at Carrbridge or Aviemore on the Perth to Inverness line.

There are enough sporting facilities on site to stage your own mini-Olympics: volleyball, football, badminton, table football, table tennis and p\u00e9tanque, as well as the lake for a cooling dip. The Haute Maurienne is a wild place of forests, meadows, lakes and streams, and a broad range of flora and fauna. It all makes for great hiking country but there\u2019s also via ferrata, mountain biking and paragliding on offer. The village contains some useful shops and a bar/restaurant, while bread, hot and cold drinks and ice-cream are sold on site. And if you want to leave the tent at home, there are yurts, tipis and cabins.

There are shower and toilet facilities for disabled campers and a refuge containing a small library. The campsite is also a certified sanctuary for birds: the owners can supply binoculars and guides on the local avian life, and also lay on organised ornithological walks in July and August. But where this little Eden really wins is with its unpretentious spa \u2013 a sauna is complemented by two spacious wooden hot tubs on a terrace outside from where you can watch the stars while you soak. Getting there Before 4pm on the day before your arrival, ring the on-demand bus service (+33 4 68 80 80 80) to arrange the bus to pick you up from Argel\u00e8s-Gazost-Cord\u00e9e railway station and drop you at the campsite near Aucun (fare \u20ac1).

The Three Peaks \u2013 Eiger, M\u00f6nch and Jungfrau \u2013 are just across the valley, and at over 1,000 metres above sea level, this is a great place to fill your lungs with mountain air. There\u2019s plenty of sunshine too \u2013 Beatenberg is acknowledged as the sun terrace of the Berner Oberland. The village is home to little restaurants and a swimming pool, while further afield there\u2019s the St Beatus hiking trail and tandem paragliding to try out. Camping-Ferien Wang has just 28 pitches, spread out over a prime slice of Swiss greensward, and in summer the local baker makes a daily delivery of bread fresh from the oven, so you might not want to leave at all. Getting there Take the train to Interlaken West then board the 101 post bus for the climb up to Beatenberg. Jump out at the Lood stop and you\u2019re just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the campsite. Alternatively, take the 21 bus to Beatenbucht and complete your journey on the funicular railway. \u2022 Tent from \u20ac11 plus adult \u20ac5.50, child (5-15) \u20ac3, under-fives \u20ac2, camping-wang.naturpur.ch Venice, Italy Fancy Venice but don\u2019t care for the summer prices? Simply pack a tent and head for this recently opened campsite on the Cavallino-Treporti peninsula, a mere 40-minute ferry ride from La Serenissima\u2019s bright lights and gondolas. Agricampeggio da Scarpa is a project of the farming/inn-keeping Scarpa family whose declared aim is \u201cto combine love for the land with warm hospitality for tourists\u201d. The fruits of their love for the land are on sale on site too. It\u2019s 500 metres to a blue flag beach where the annual Beach on Fire firework display is held at the end of August. From the Punta Sabbioni pier that serves the campsite from Venice, there are also direct sailings to the islands of Burano and Murano, which makes for very easy day-tripping. Getting there From the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station, head across town to the S Marco-S Zaccaria \u2018A\u2019 pier to take a Line 14 or 15 ferry for the 40-minute sailing to Punta Sabbioni. The campsite is a \u00be-mile walk away. \u2022 Tent from \u20ac12.50 plus adult from \u20ac5, young people (14-25) \u20ac4, child (2-13) \u20ac3, agricampeggiodascarpa.it Valencia province, Spain With cracking views of the medieval town of Bocairent, and a swimming pool and gardens with hammocks to lounge in, the peaceful little Villa Carmen Bocairent campsite in the Sierra Mariola mountains is something of a peach. It\u2019s also set in an orchard of a country house whose apple, fig, pear and nut trees give ample shade when the temperature rises. And with numbers limited to just 16 campers, tranquility is more or less assured. Bocairent is a short walk away \u2013 it\u2019s a town of small squares, cobbled streets and fountains with a selection of bars and restaurants serving traditional Valencian dishes. The town\u2019s Las Danzas festival takes place from 23-27 August every year, with performances of centuries-old dances and rites in the main square late each evening, followed by a daytime procession on 28 August to honour Sant Agust\u00ed. Getting there Take the train to Valencia and pick up the Valencia-Ontinyent-Banyeres bus for the 1\u00be-hour trip to Bocairent. Alternatively, take the train up to Ontinyent and join the same bus for a 20-minute journey.

In a little under two acres it fits in ponds, a bright airy cafe serving up breakfast, coffee and homemade cakes, and modern facilities with full access for disabled campers. The site\u2019s proximity to Freiburg makes a visit to the medieval city and its extraordinary gothic cathedral a must. A climb of the Schlossberg hill and the terrifying viewing tower at its summit is also in order. The self-styled Jewel of the Black Forest also has some fantastic cycle paths (and plenty of bike rental outlets), making it a very pleasant city to negotiate on two wheels. Getting there From Freiburg-Littenweiler railway station take the no 17 bus for the 10-minute ride to Freiburg Kleintalstrasse, from where it\u2019s a mile\u2019s walk to the campsite. Alternatively, it\u2019s a very pleasant three-mile woodland walk from the station. \u2022 Tent and two adults \u20ac25, additional adult \u20ac8.50, child (3-12) \u20ac3.50, teenagers (13-17) \u20ac7, camping pod (sleeps two) \u20ac50, caravan (sleeps two-four) \u20ac65-85, camping-freiburg.com Rhineland, Germany Guarded by a castle and shoe-horned into a peaceful side-valley off the Rhine, long and thin Camping Park Rheineck, in Bad Breisig, juts into a thick forest. There\u2019s a little shop and mini-cafe on site, and sheltered seating for campers in case the weather goes wrong. It\u2019s eco-friendly too \u2013 all the campsite\u2019s electricity comes from a hydro-scheme. The Rhine is just around the corner, making the campsite a good base for cruises along the river and hikes along the three main Rhineland trails: the Rheinburgenweg, Rheinsteig and Rotweinwanderweg. The path up to the viewing point at Reutersley starts right at the campsite too. Bad Breisig is a spa town of many festivals and food-related events; the 46th annual culinary festival takes place from 19-28 July this year. And if you fancy a summer party, the campsite is holding one on 17 August. Getting there Take the train to Bad Breisig on the line south from Bonn. The campsite is a few minutes\u2019 walk from the station. \u2022 Tent \u20ac3.50-\u20ac5 plus adult \u20ac6, child (6-16) \u20ac3.50. Pod for one \u20ac10, for two \u20ac15, camping-rheineck.de Dalsland, Sweden On the edge of a wood, by one of Lake R\u00e5varpen\u2019s sandy beaches, sits the small, idyllic H\u00f6gsbyns Fritidscenter campsite. For those keen on exploring R\u00e5varpen\u2019s tiny islands, the owners rent out kayaks, canoes or rowing boats. Those who prefer dry land can check out the neighbouring nature reserve with its bronze age rock carvings. Or hike along one of the many footpaths, including the Dalsland Pilgrim Trail. Urban life of sorts comes in the shape of Dals L\u00e5nged, a small town three miles away, which has some shops and art galleries. But loafing by the tent gazing out over the wide expanse of water may seem a much better idea. Getting there Catch the train from Gothenburg to Bengtsfors or Mellerud. From either of these, take the (summer only) DVVJ train all the way to H\u00f6gsbyn. \u2022 Two adults and a child (under-17) from \u00a314, kayak \u00a321 a day, canoe/rowing boat \u00a325, hogsbynsfritidscenter.se Tj\u00f6rn island, southern Sweden Tj\u00f6rn is Sweden\u2019s sixth largest island and a playground for the inhabitants of Gothenburg. It\u2019s connected to the mainland via a bridge, which means the frequent direct bus from the city can speed over to the small Hav &amp; Logi Sk\u00e4rhamn campsite on the west coast of the island in just 75 minutes. Hav &amp; Logi is set below the outcropping rocks for which the area is renowned and the sea is just a 500-metre walk away. You can rent bikes at the reception and take a coastal ride along cycle paths or visit the Nordic Watercolour Museum to see how artists have been inspired by the scenery. Although the campsite is popular with campervanners, those with tents are given the nicest pitches closest to the surrounding greenery. For luxury-huggers, the site also has some fancy holiday lets and a hostel. Getting there Catch the Tj\u00f6rn Express bus from the Nils Ericson Bus Terminal in Gothenburg \u2013 next to the central railway station \u2013 and jump out at R\u00f6avallen just outside the campsite. \u2022 Tent from \u00a316 a day, cycle hire \u00a313 per day, havologi.se Near Zagreb, Croatia Set beneath the walls of a ruined medieval town a few miles west of Zagreb, the Etno Ku\u0107a campsite at Klake village, near Samobor, is part of a family-run farm. It\u2019s surrounded by pleasingly rustic wooden housing. It all gives the campsite the feel of a hideaway \u2013 remarkably so given its location close to the capital. Being on the edge of the \u017dumberak-Samoborsko Gorje nature park, campers have easy access to a number of sumptuous hiking paths as well as a bike trail. There\u2019s also a small local heritage museum on the site and a super-cheap attic apartment (sleeps two). Getting there Take the 151, 156 or 162 bus for the half-hour trip from \u010crnomerec in Zagreb to Samobor. From there, the 142 bus takes 10 minutes to get to Klake, a short walk from the campsite. \u2022 Tent \u00a34 plus adult \u00a37, child (7-12) \u00a33, etno-kuca.hr Central, Portugal It says something for Camping Pelinos, a tranquil little garden campsite, that when its young Dutch owners (R\u00e9my, Esther and Samuel) happened upon it back in 2010 while on a campervan tour of Europe, they liked it so much they bought it. They run a cute little alfresco bar, and there\u2019s a bijou swimming pool amid lush vegetation with views of the woodland beyond. Each morning, you can buy eggs laid by the resident hens and freshly baked bread. The village of Pelinos is typical of the area and worth a wander around, while medieval Tomar is just four miles away. The riverside town was once the headquarters of the Knights Templar and its monastery is a Unesco world heritage site. It also hosts a weekly Romany market and has a plethora of good value restaurants and bars to check out. Getting there It\u2019s a two-hour train ride from Lisbon Santa Apolonia to Tomar from where the 584 or 5841 bus will drop you at Casal das Aboboreiras, a five-minute walk from the campsite. \u2022 Tent from \u20ac4.75 plus adult \u20ac5, child (2-12) from \u20ac2.70, campingpelinos.com County Galway, Ireland Unlikely though it may sound, one of the most westerly isles off the coast of Ireland is easy to reach by public transport. The beautiful six-square-mile Inishbofin island more than repays the journey, too. Its population of around 180 supports a pub and a restaurant, and the Inishbofin Island Hostel with a smashing little campsite attached. After taking in the views of the Connemara mountains on the mainland, head off to one of the many sandy beaches, do a bit of scuba diving, or hire a bike and go off on a seal-spotting expedition. All three hotels and the pub on the island host live Irish folk music sessions. And for those who want an upgrade on a tent, there are some very smart camping pods for hire. Getting there From Dublin, take the direct train to Galway City then hop on the coach to Cleggan Pier from where the ferry sails to Inishbofin. The campsite is a 10-minute walk from the jetty. \u2022 Adult \u20ac14pp, child (under-12) \u20ac6, pod \u20ac50 a night, inishbofin-hostel.ie Near Olsztyn, north-east Poland Angels are said to watch over tourists in these parts, though that\u2019s probably just an excuse so that they get to hang out here too. Set in the River Pisa valley on a little peninsula jutting out into Lake Pisz, the Camping Tumiany forms a small part of a larger complex that includes 10 wooden cabins and a campsite restaurant serving regional cuisine, with an emphasis on fish dishes. Lovers of the outdoors are rather spoilt here \u2013 besides lakeside hikes and horse riding, there are kayaks, canoes and bicycles for hire on site. It means campers can take advantage of Tumiany\u2019s location on the kayaking trail of the Pisa, Dadaj and \u0141yna rivers, and the plentiful local cycle paths. For the less energetic, a private sandy beach and lake cruises offer opportunities for lounging. Getting there Take the frequent Express Bus from Olsztyn towards Mr\u0105gowo and after 30 minutes alight at the Kromerowo bus stop, from where it\u2019s a pleasant rural walk to the campsite. \u2022 Tent \u00a33-4 plus adult \u00a33, child (3-11) \u00a32, camping-tumiany.pl Blagaj, Bosnia-Herzegovina It\u2019s unusual enough to find a campsite in the middle of a town, but to find one in such a prime spot on the banks of a river is a double bonus. The small River Camp Aganovac sits beside a bridge over the Buna. It\u2019s shaded by willows and the river is on hand for a cooling dip (it stays chilled even in the height of summer). A kitchen is provided for campers, though there\u2019s a good selection of restaurants in town, which also has an early Ottoman Dervish house and a medieval hamam to visit. For a longer walk, the Blagaj Fort (locally called Stjepan grad) is a 40-minute stroll away and provides fantastic views of the Buna and Neretva valleys. Getting there Take the train to Mostar and then the 10, 11 or 12 bus from Spanish Square near the eastern bus station to Blagaj. \u2022 Tent and two people \u20ac10, tent and four people \u20ac13, rent-a-tent and three people \u20ac15, camping-blagaj.com Near Tilburg, The Netherlands If you have young children who love farm animals, small rural farm-based Mini-camping Pergama LandJuweel by Haaren town could be for you. Kids can get up close and personal with chickens, turkeys, ducks, guinea pigs and rabbits, and help to curl maize and feed it to the calves. There are excellent facilities for those with disabilities; go-karts and a tractor to ride; and bikes to rent to explore the surrounding countryside. The owners are also rather sweetly obsessed with hot air balloons and will gladly arrange a flight over Het Groene Woud (The Green Forest). The quirkiness continues back on the ground with a dog school \u2013 so if you enjoy watching our canine friends going through their paces, you\u2019re in for a treat (as are they, probably, if they behave themselves). Getting there From Herogenbosch Centraal railway station take the hourly 140 bus to Haaren. The campsite is a five-minute walk away. \u2022 Tent and one person \u20ac12, additional adult \u20ac4.50, child (under 10) \u20ac3.50, pergama.nl Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Grimes told the New Scientist (yes, in this new era, that\u2019s where Grimes does her interviews) that her forthcoming album Miss_Anthrop0cene explores what an \u201canthropomorphic goddess of climate crisis\u201d would be like. \u201cIs she sexy and goth and rude?\u201d she pondered. \u201cIt\u2019s like, hipster neoclassicism.

The 2019 answer to Bedingfield\u2019s bleating has been Lil Dicky\u2019s Earth, an all-star environmental awareness anthem that raises money for Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s foundation, which protects vulnerable wildlife. It includes lines from Lil Jon such as: \u201cWhat the fuck? I\u2019m a clam\u201d, and Justin Bieber singing, \u201cHi, I\u2019m a baboon, I\u2019m like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were trying to do it in a way where we could actually get people to listen, and still do something where everyone\u2019s actually learning,\u201d says Benny Blanco, Earth\u2019s producer, who has also worked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2017/jun/25/katy-perry-glastonbury-diary-in-pictures\">Katy Perry</a> and Kanye\u2019s biggest hits. \u201cWe really do have to make a huge change or we\u2019re fucked, but if someone comes at you in a fun, accessible way it makes people want to look into it more, research more, because it wasn\u2019t shoved down their throats in some way they can\u2019t understand.\u201d It\u2019s certainly resonating; the video for Earth has been viewed more than 160m times.</p> <p>The message is filtering further through Hollywood, with big stars now toppling over each other to find ways of addressing environmental disasters. Anne Hathaway and Mark Ruffalo are shortly to star in a retelling of the DuPont chemical scandal and the mass pollution of American water by the company. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/22/natalie-portman-criticises-moby-friendship-dating-memoir\">Natalie Portman</a> has executive-produced a new documentary on the horrors of intensive farming.

But already you can see how this way of thinking about the climate is having real-world impact.</p> <p>Artists have begun to get their own houses in order, particularly with regards to the pressure put on the National Portrait Gallery (NPG), Royal Opera House and Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) to end their partnerships with BP. This month, 78 artists including Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor wrote to the NPG saying BP\u2019s role \u201cin furthering the climate crisis\u201d made it an unacceptable partner. Mark Rylance has already resigned his position at the RSC because of links with the company.</p> <p>But the bigger impact can be felt in how climate activists have engaged with, and pushed back at, popular culture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/extinction-rebellion-highlight-climate-emergency-at-glastonbury\">Extinction Rebellion</a> did not exist a year ago; it is now the fastest-growing activist group in the world. It has understood how art, advertising and popular culture pushes people to consume and waste more \u2013 and how it can be exploited to make a quick and permanent change.</p> <p>The group travelled to 2019\u2019s Cannes Lions, the insanely luxurious week-long advertising awards where execs rub shoulder pads with movie stars and rappers. This year, the big winner was the powerful \u201cDream Crazy\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/08/colin-kaepernick-nike-ad-sales-up\">Nike advert starring Colin Kaepernick</a>, widely praised for its support of refugees, disabled athletes and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>. It is reflective of how brands have become effective at commodifying dissent, all while promoting environment-destroying fast fashion reportedly made by underpaid workers and taking advantage of major tax loopholes.</p> <p>Extinction Rebellion wasn\u2019t buying it. Its activists unfurled a banner down the steps of the Palais and quickly became the talk of the festival. \u201cWe\u2019re very worried about greenwashing; there\u2019s a big fad around brand activism but the people we spoke to at Cannes said that brands are still concerned with profit over impact,\u201d says Alanna Byrne, one of the protesters. \u201cWe were there to tell them: it\u2019s not enough; the impact they\u2019re having on biodiversity is huge and trying to jump on the activist trend isn\u2019t going to change that. They need to relay the emergency rather than continually make people buy things.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84c1a57d88075964c8ae83d0d575ea6a325025ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84c1a57d88075964c8ae83d0d575ea6a325025ec/0_6_1654_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Nike; Vampire Weekend; Liberate Tate; Grimes; Anohni; Extinction Rebellion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Environmental as anything...

Not ideal - the perils of early print deadlines. But this @goodweekendmag cover story is not about George per se - it\u2019s about an important issue in the restaurant industry: chefs, mental health, untimely deaths, and attempts at last to do something about it. To do nothing less than save lives. Jane Strode talks movingly about the death of her chef husband Jeremy, at only 53. Mal Meiers talks about introducing a new softer culture at his restaurant in Newcastle. And yes, George talks about how meditation helped him deal with his public shaming over wage theft a couple of years ago (he\u2019ll need more now that the figure has blown out to three times what he\u2019d previously admitted) and how he is now trying to get his staff into it. Also in this issue is a piece on our obsession with sleep and anxiety over our lack of it by Amanda Hooton. It occurred to me that these two stories are linked - the ridiculously long hours chefs spend in hot windowless kitchens can\u2019t be good for their mental health. Limiting shift hours is long overdue - let\u2019s hope owners like George stick to their statements in that regard. Or are made to. #goodweekendmag</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/katrinastrick/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Katrina Strickland</a> (@katrinastrick) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-07-19T22:15:31+00:00\">Jul 19, 2019 at 3:15pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>On Saturday morning, the digital editions of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/i-m-not-a-grieving-widow-i-m-a-seething-widow-20190716-p527k2.html\">ran the story on their front pages</a>, but with the image and headline referencing Strode rather than Calombaris.</p> <p>The feature, which described Calombaris at a meditation session \u201cin Melbourne\u2019s leafy suburb of Kew\u201d and at home \u201cin the privacy of his Toorak mansion\u201d, addressed the stress he experienced in 2017 when his restaurant first self-reported the $2.6m underpayment, and he was charged with assault after a dispute at an A-League match.</p> <p>\u201cHe later won an appeal against his conviction, and paid staff entitlements in full, but the backlash was forceful and swift,\u201d the feature read. \u201cGetting hammered in the press, he struggled to cope.\u201d</p> <p>Online, the sentence \u201cpaid staff their full entitlements\u201d, was changed to read \u201csaid he\u2019d paid back his staff entitlements in full\u201d.</p> <p>In the piece, author Luke Benedictus questioned whether this was \u201ca PR move\u201d from Calombaris, before concluding that it was not.</p> <p>\u201cSceptics might question if all this is a PR move from a man whose public image is still tarnished,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Calombaris \u2013 not someone who tends to do anything half-cocked \u2013 comes across like a man on a mission \u2026 Fuelling his meditation zeal is a belated recognition that the old ways of running a restaurant are defunct.\u201d</p> <p>The feature said employees at Calombaris\u2019s restaurant chain now had their working hours capped at 40 hours a week, and that management \u201cis instructed to keep a close eye on the personal welfare of their teams\u201d.</p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "An early print deadline has been blamed for the \u201cnot ideal\u201d decision to feature TV chef George Calombaris on the cover of Nine newspapers\u2019 Good Weekend magazine, two days after his restaurant chain was revealed to have underpaid workers by $7.8m. The Good Weekend hit the stands on Saturday morning with a full cover portrait of Calombaris, with words arranged around his head to form a halo. The feature \u2013 on chefs, mental health and overwork \u2013 explored the restaurateur\u2019s use of meditation to cope with stress after his wage underpayment scandal was self-reported two years ago, estimated at $2.6m. \u201cIt saved me at a point in my life where I hit darkness,\u201d the halo read. On Thursday, the Fair Work Ombudsman announced that it and Calombaris\u2019s Made Establishment company had agreed that the company had underpaid staff by three times that amount, totalling $7.8m. In an Instagram post, the editor of the Good Weekend, Katrina Strickland, conceded the timing of the cover was not ideal, but said this was because of an early print deadline. The magazine had been sent to print on Friday last week, and the details of the full underpayment was made public only on Thursday. Previously, Calombaris had admitted in April 2017 to underpayments of $2.6m stretching back to 2011. On Friday, the Age reported that two more workers had come forward. \u201cI know I know, George Calombaris on the cover,\u201d Strickland wrote. \u201cNot ideal \u2013 the perils of early print deadlines. \u201cBut this @goodweekendmag cover story is not about George per se \u2013 it\u2019s about an important issue in the restaurant industry: chefs, mental health, untimely deaths, and attempts at last to do something about it. \u201cAnd yes, George talks about how meditation helped him deal with his public shaming over wage theft a couple of years ago. He\u2019ll need more now that the figure has blown out to three times what he\u2019d previously admitted \u2013 and how he is now trying to get his staff into it.\u201d Strickland added in a statement that the feature had been updated. \u201cThe current issue of Good Weekend was sent to print late last week, ahead of the Fair Work ruling. While we have updated the online version of the cover story to reflect recent events, the story itself is about a much broader topic \u2013 mental health \u2013 of which George was a part of but not the sole focus.\u201d The feature also involved interviews with chef Jane Strode, the widow of fellow chef Jeremy Strode, and Newcastle chef Mal Meiers. On Saturday morning, the digital editions of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age ran the story on their front pages, but with the image and headline referencing Strode rather than Calombaris. The feature, which described Calombaris at a meditation session \u201cin Melbourne\u2019s leafy suburb of Kew\u201d and at home \u201cin the privacy of his Toorak mansion\u201d, addressed the stress he experienced in 2017 when his restaurant first self-reported the $2.6m underpayment, and he was charged with assault after a dispute at an A-League match. \u201cHe later won an appeal against his conviction, and paid staff entitlements in full, but the backlash was forceful and swift,\u201d the feature read. \u201cGetting hammered in the press, he struggled to cope.\u201d Online, the sentence \u201cpaid staff their full entitlements\u201d, was changed to read \u201csaid he\u2019d paid back his staff entitlements in full\u201d. In the piece, author Luke Benedictus questioned whether this was \u201ca PR move\u201d from Calombaris, before concluding that it was not. \u201cSceptics might question if all this is a PR move from a man whose public image is still tarnished,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Calombaris \u2013 not someone who tends to do anything half-cocked \u2013 comes across like a man on a mission \u2026 Fuelling his meditation zeal is a belated recognition that the old ways of running a restaurant are defunct.\u201d The feature said employees at Calombaris\u2019s restaurant chain now had their working hours capped at 40 hours a week, and that management \u201cis instructed to keep a close eye on the personal welfare of their teams\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "I am woken by a sort of alarm \u2013 the sound of the dog\u2019s strangled barks as it dreams about chasing something while asleep at my feet. I poke my big toe into its ribs and it stops; the equivalent of hitting snooze. I fall back asleep and have one of those tedious dreams that amounts to a practice run for the day ahead \u2013 a dream about waking up, going downstairs and finding out there\u2019s no milk. A bit later, I find myself intruding on an argument between a married couple. She wants to separate; he does not. He pleads, his voice raw with emotion. I open my eyes. Their argument continues. I roll over. My wife is awake and sitting up in bed. The man suggests counselling, but the woman is adamant: he must leave. They start shouting. \u201cWhere is that coming from?\u201d I say. \u201cMy phone,\u201d my wife says, holding it up. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d \u201cIs this, like, a channel that you subscribe to?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just getting some tips,\u201d she says. \u201cGood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Time passes. The man moves out, and the couple begin to navigate an agonising course toward an amicable split, their voices coolly civil as they discuss the children. A little later, the woman is tortured by the possibility that the man is seeing someone else. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d I say. \u201cShe kicked him out!\u201d \u201cShe wasn\u2019t happy,\u201d my wife says. \u201cShe\u2019s less happy now!\u201d I say. \u201cSometimes change is painful, but necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the message.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cThe message is, change is stupid.\u201d I get up and go downstairs to make coffee.

      "body": "<p>My brother wants a girlfriend. He writes it on his Facebook wall and texts me most weeks to tell me this. The messages I receive late at night, the ones that say, \u201cI\u2019m lonely. Can you help find me a girlfriend?\u201d are hardest to read.</p> <p>Christian is a catch. He\u2019s a radio DJ, he volunteers for a soup kitchen and campaigns for the homeless. He lives on the seafront in Brighton and can deliver a commentary on Love Island better than any media person I know. He\u2019s sociable, handsome and has his own hair. He is 47 and is yet to met \u201cthe one\u201d.</p> <p>He has asked me to find him a dating site and set him up with a profile, which sounds simple enough \u2013 but the reality is different. Christian has a learning disability. As an adult who lives alone, who has no need for a care worker and enjoys a busy social life, Christian falls into a difficult gap in the dating scene. He is too vulnerable for conventional apps such as Tinder or match.com; but he doesn\u2019t feel catered for by disability dating events and sites, either.</p> <p>Generally, when Christian wants something, he can manifest it. He\u2019s a hustler. He will casually drop into conversation that he has set up a choir or is helping to launch a club night. He persuaded a local pub to hold a speed-dating evening (although only two people turned up, so it didn\u2019t quite take off). He was picked to be part of the relay team that carried the Queen\u2019s Baton to the Commonwealth Games. He\u2019s active in his community and knows his neighbours\u2019 names.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018You\u2019re too dateable!\u2019 I say of his Undateables  rejection. 'Why then,' he asks, 'can I not get a girlfriend?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I say all of this, not just because I\u2019m a proud sister, but to show that Christian\u2019s learning disability doesn\u2019t hold him back from living a really full life. Generally, I don\u2019t worry about him, but it\u2019s hard to see that the one thing he wants \u2013 a girlfriend \u2013 he can\u2019t seem to make happen.</p> <p>He applied to be on the television show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-undateables\" title=\"\">The Undateables</a> twice, and was rejected twice. \u201cYou\u2019re too dateable!\u201d we tell him. \u201cWhy then,\u201d he asks, \u201ccan I not get a girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s on two dating websites \u2013 Tinder and Badoo \u2013 but the process is gruelling. The shallow, disposable nature of online dating doesn\u2019t really allow for honesty and conversation about disabilities. Christian\u2019s is not a diagnosable condition; he can\u2019t tick a box for autism or cerebral palsy, which means potential dates would have no point of reference even if he was open about his learning difficulty.</p> <p>He does go on dates. Recently he set the family WhatsApp on fire by disappearing for the weekend with a woman he had met in a local cafe. He left his phone charger at home, which meant we couldn\u2019t get through to him for nearly 48 hours. I\u2019d like to say the family didn\u2019t panic, but that\u2019s not true. My sister and I were about to call the police when our cousin, who is close to Christian, said, \u201cYou have to let him go away for the weekend without getting the authorities involved.\u201d</p> <p>My cousin was right. Christian arrived home on the Sunday, blushing but happy.</p> <p>That we were quick to assume he was in danger is telling. It\u2019s worth considering how I would feel about him dating if he were a woman with learning disabilities.

      "bodyText": "My brother wants a girlfriend. He writes it on his Facebook wall and texts me most weeks to tell me this. The messages I receive late at night, the ones that say, \u201cI\u2019m lonely. Can you help find me a girlfriend?\u201d are hardest to read. Christian is a catch. He\u2019s a radio DJ, he volunteers for a soup kitchen and campaigns for the homeless. He lives on the seafront in Brighton and can deliver a commentary on Love Island better than any media person I know. He\u2019s sociable, handsome and has his own hair. He is 47 and is yet to met \u201cthe one\u201d. He has asked me to find him a dating site and set him up with a profile, which sounds simple enough \u2013 but the reality is different. Christian has a learning disability. As an adult who lives alone, who has no need for a care worker and enjoys a busy social life, Christian falls into a difficult gap in the dating scene. He is too vulnerable for conventional apps such as Tinder or match.com; but he doesn\u2019t feel catered for by disability dating events and sites, either. Generally, when Christian wants something, he can manifest it. He\u2019s a hustler. He will casually drop into conversation that he has set up a choir or is helping to launch a club night. He persuaded a local pub to hold a speed-dating evening (although only two people turned up, so it didn\u2019t quite take off). He was picked to be part of the relay team that carried the Queen\u2019s Baton to the Commonwealth Games. He\u2019s active in his community and knows his neighbours\u2019 names. I say all of this, not just because I\u2019m a proud sister, but to show that Christian\u2019s learning disability doesn\u2019t hold him back from living a really full life. Generally, I don\u2019t worry about him, but it\u2019s hard to see that the one thing he wants \u2013 a girlfriend \u2013 he can\u2019t seem to make happen. He applied to be on the television show The Undateables twice, and was rejected twice. \u201cYou\u2019re too dateable!\u201d we tell him. \u201cWhy then,\u201d he asks, \u201ccan I not get a girlfriend?\u201d He\u2019s on two dating websites \u2013 Tinder and Badoo \u2013 but the process is gruelling. The shallow, disposable nature of online dating doesn\u2019t really allow for honesty and conversation about disabilities. Christian\u2019s is not a diagnosable condition; he can\u2019t tick a box for autism or cerebral palsy, which means potential dates would have no point of reference even if he was open about his learning difficulty. He does go on dates. Recently he set the family WhatsApp on fire by disappearing for the weekend with a woman he had met in a local cafe. He left his phone charger at home, which meant we couldn\u2019t get through to him for nearly 48 hours. I\u2019d like to say the family didn\u2019t panic, but that\u2019s not true. My sister and I were about to call the police when our cousin, who is close to Christian, said, \u201cYou have to let him go away for the weekend without getting the authorities involved.\u201d My cousin was right. Christian arrived home on the Sunday, blushing but happy. That we were quick to assume he was in danger is telling. It\u2019s worth considering how I would feel about him dating if he were a woman with learning disabilities. That the conversation about adults with disabilities dating quickly comes round to risk and safety doesn\u2019t foster a healthy, thriving love life.

You don\u2019t even have to be able to execute a basic chest pass, as celebrities including Sally Phillips and Love Island\u2019s Montana Brown prove. Several haven\u2019t stepped on a court since school, but once a goal defence, always a goal defence. Team captain Jennifer Saunders (big GD energy) has dubbed it \u201chen party\u201d style and that sums up the mood. Strictly\u2019s Oti Mabuse captains the other team, while Clare Balding presents. Ellen E Jones London\u2019s Great Bridges: Lighting the Thames 7pm, Channel 4 The final episode follows preparations for the big switch-on, when 69,000 lights will illuminate four of central London\u2019s bridges. However, trouble arises when the Millennium Bridge proves to be a tricky canvas for what is destined to become the world\u2019s longest piece of public art. Mike Bradley Moon Landing Live 8pm, Channel 4 Exactly 50 years to the day since Apollo 11 astronauts made the first moon landing, an edited version of events allows us to relive the tense final stages of the mission as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin negotiate the descent to the moon\u2019s surface, call President Nixon and embark on a perilous journey home. MB Korn: Loud Krazy Love 9pm, Sky Arts A revealing film about the life of Brian \u201cHead\u201d Welch, guitarist with Californian nu-metal outfit Korn. He left the band in 2005, vowing to kick his meth habit, got clean and rejoined in 2013. A new Korn album, The Nothing, which he describes as \u201cguitar-heavy and energetic\u201d, is due out in September. MB The World\u2019s Most Shocking Ads With Shane Ritchie 9.55pm, Channel 5 The affable Ritchie is your host for this rundown of ad-land\u2019s most memorable moments. Expect to see skydiving cats flogging insurance, pensioners on the rampage and, of course, unicorns in the bathroom. Will Ritchie pull out his old Daz ad while he\u2019s at it? Hannah Verdier Atlanta: Robbin\u2019 Season 10pm, BBC Two Donald Glover\u2019s subtle, unsettling comedy-drama continues with another well-observed meditation on power dynamics. Earn\u2019s disastrous night out with Van, where he encounters racist micro-aggressions at every turn, is mirrored by Paper Boi\u2019s uneasy experience with a hapless white recording engineer. Phil Harrison Film choice First Man, 12noon, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Fifty years after that giant leap for mankind, a timely showing for director Damien Chazelle\u2019s biopic of Neil Armstrong. Ryan Gosling plays the restrained astronaut, propelled to the farthest reaches of human ingenuity partly, it seems, by the grief of his two-year-old daughter\u2019s death.

The store is closing in the autumn because the supermarket says it \u201chas been unable to find a way to make the shop profitable in the long term\u201d. The store will become a branch of Lidl, the German discount supermarket chain that, along with Aldi, is expanding aggressively in the UK and shaking up the status quo. Bridget Wright, who has shopped there all her life, is stunned by the closure: \u201cOh my God. I can\u2019t believe it. My husband told me this morning that Waitrose was closing some stores but I was sure our store would be safe because it is always busy and the staff are lovely.\u201d The 64-year-old likes the German chain too, but she prefers Waitrose with its wine selection and upmarket product range. \u201cThey sell duck eggs which I don\u2019t think you can get in Lidl.\u201d A survey once claimed that the arrival of a branch of Waitrose in a neighbourhood, with its upmarket organic food brand Duchy and Heston Blumenthal range, could add nearly \u00a340,000 to the value of homes. But the retailer, which is part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, is now in retreat, selling off or closing unprofitable shops as it adjusts to an intensely competitive grocery market where low-priced rivals are on the up. There is clear evidence that snobbery associated with where people shop is a thing of the past in Britain as shoppers seek out the best quality at the best prices. Aldi and Lidl are the fastest-growing supermarket chains in the UK as some of their larger mainstream rivals are questioning their business models. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda \u2013 the UK\u2019s second- and third-largest supermarkets \u2013 recently tried to merge in an attempt to strengthen their hand against the discounters but the competition watchdog blocked the deal. Even though she has an emotional attachment to the store, Kylie Day thinks Lidl will be a better option for local people struggling to get by on low incomes. She says the Waitrose store suffered from a \u201clack of custom\u201d even though there is little competition in the vicinity. \u201cI\u2019ll be sad to see it go as I\u2019ve got memories of coming here with my nan \u2026but I think Lidl will get more shoppers because of the prices,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the older generation have moved on and there is nobody here to spend money: younger people haven\u2019t got it.\u201d Aldi and Lidl are now bigger than Waitrose, which is only the eighth biggest chain in the UK with 344 stores.

Last Christmas \u2013 a time when Britons traditionally take their custom to more upmarket stores such as Waitrose \u2013 two-thirds of UK households visited Aldi and Lidl, handing them their biggest ever slice of festive spending. Waitrose says the decision to close seven supermarkets, with three \u2013 Bromley, Oadby in Leicestershire and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire \u2013 being sold to Lidl, is not a sign it is throwing in the towel.

Byzantine rule had gone backwards for generations prior to its fall to the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II in 1453, who repopulated the ruined city with Jews and Christians to help build one of the most sophisticated and cosmopolitan centres of its time, courted for its commercial power by Venice and a magnet for Renaissance Italian scholars and artists (Leonardo even proposed a design for a bridge across the Golden Horn for the sultan in 1502). The city\u2019s first officially recognised printing press opened in 1727, not because of previous objections by zealous mullahs but because of the Islamic handwritten calligraphic tradition that regarded words as art \u2013 something print struggled to reproduce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a40f96758ac08e5b3658fda23d3134f44da618e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a40f96758ac08e5b3658fda23d3134f44da618e7/884_305_728_911/400.jpg\" alt=\"Sultan Mehmed II\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sultan Mehmed II transformed Constantinople into \u2018one of the most sophisticated and cosmopolitan centres of its time\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson argues there is nothing like Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel in the Muslim world \u201cbecause it is beyond the technical accomplishment of Islamic art\u201d and \u201ctheologically offensive to Islam\u201d. Wrong. He might like to know that scholars now believe Michelangelo took inspiration for designing St Peter\u2019s from the imperial mosques designed by the Ottoman architect Sinan, who also influenced the other great Italian architect, Palladio. Johnson\u2019s attack on Islamic aniconism \u2013 the rejection of figurative images \u2013 betrays a profound ignorance of both Islamic calligraphy and the differences between Sunni and Shia traditions in representing figures. But then there\u2019s little sense that he even grasps the differences between the two Islamic denominations as he collapses the diversity of what he calls the Islamic world into one angry, ignorant monolith.</p> <p>As with so much of Johnson\u2019s posturing, none of this is new. His argument is a clumsy rehash of the orientalist scholar <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/01/what-went-wrong/302387/\" title=\"\">Bernard Lewis\u2019s infamous essay, What Went Wrong</a>, published shortly after 9/11, which argued that the \u201cmighty civilisation\u201d of medieval Islam was subsequently reduced to aping the west because of a self-induced lack of political freedom, and led to him advising George W Bush\u2019s administration on the invasion of Iraq in the name of freedom (presumably the fact that it didn\u2019t go too well is also the fault of Islam). Lewis was an academic ideologue with some knowledge of Islam, however much he compromised it to suit his political agenda. Johnson parrots Lewis\u2019s arguments with absolutely no historical understanding whatsoever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/24/tory-members-would-not-want-muslim-prime-minister-islamophobia-survey\">Nearly half of Tory members would not want Muslim PM \u2013\u00a0poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To some extent, his position is understandable: the tradition of Greco-Roman study at Oxford that produced the man we all know has always quietly assumed the \u201cEast\u201d, from the Persian empire to the rise of Islam, was its backward, despotic antithesis. And hardly anyone within that field studies Arab or early Islamic history, or bothers learning Arabic.</p> <p>So the myths and prejudices harden into facts. There is no awareness of the life of Muhammad, a merchant outside the Meccan trading elite, and the early history of the Qur\u2019an. The only Qur\u2019anic passages written in the prophet\u2019s lifetime concerned commerce, representing middling merchants, traders and the poor. So much for a religion inimical to capitalism.</p> <p>There is no space in Johnson\u2019s rhetoric for the scientific and cultural achievements of medieval Islam. Nor is there any acknowledgment that the \u201cfatal religious conservatism\u201d is primarily down to the influence of Wahhabism, the puritanical doctrine founded in the 18th century that is now the official state religion of Saudi Arabia, which condemns millions of Muslims \u2013 including Shias \u2013 as apostates and has inspired terrorist organisations such as Isis. But Johnson would never acknowledge any of this because of the fear of jeopardising future trade in arms, oil and aircraft with the Saudis. There is no awareness of the so-called <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Islamic Enlightenment, the subject of Christopher Bellaigue</a>\u2019s book, cataloguing reformers in Egypt, Turkey and Iran who, from the 19th century, embraced industrialisation and struggled in support of political constitutionalism, scientific inquiry and gender equality.</p> <p>None of this would concern Johnson, because his anti-Islam statements only shore up his political base in the short term, regardless of historical reality. But \u201cspeaking your mind\u201d based on proven ignorance is no way to engage in meaningful political dialogue with a quarter of the world\u2019s population.</p> <p>Let\u2019s see how successful that is as a strategy for Johnson over the coming years.</p> <p>\u2022 Jerry Brotton is professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary University of London</p>",

His argument is a clumsy rehash of the orientalist scholar Bernard Lewis\u2019s infamous essay, What Went Wrong, published shortly after 9/11, which argued that the \u201cmighty civilisation\u201d of medieval Islam was subsequently reduced to aping the west because of a self-induced lack of political freedom, and led to him advising George W Bush\u2019s administration on the invasion of Iraq in the name of freedom (presumably the fact that it didn\u2019t go too well is also the fault of Islam). Lewis was an academic ideologue with some knowledge of Islam, however much he compromised it to suit his political agenda. Johnson parrots Lewis\u2019s arguments with absolutely no historical understanding whatsoever. To some extent, his position is understandable: the tradition of Greco-Roman study at Oxford that produced the man we all know has always quietly assumed the \u201cEast\u201d, from the Persian empire to the rise of Islam, was its backward, despotic antithesis. And hardly anyone within that field studies Arab or early Islamic history, or bothers learning Arabic. So the myths and prejudices harden into facts. There is no awareness of the life of Muhammad, a merchant outside the Meccan trading elite, and the early history of the Qur\u2019an. The only Qur\u2019anic passages written in the prophet\u2019s lifetime concerned commerce, representing middling merchants, traders and the poor. So much for a religion inimical to capitalism. There is no space in Johnson\u2019s rhetoric for the scientific and cultural achievements of medieval Islam. Nor is there any acknowledgment that the \u201cfatal religious conservatism\u201d is primarily down to the influence of Wahhabism, the puritanical doctrine founded in the 18th century that is now the official state religion of Saudi Arabia, which condemns millions of Muslims \u2013 including Shias \u2013 as apostates and has inspired terrorist organisations such as Isis. But Johnson would never acknowledge any of this because of the fear of jeopardising future trade in arms, oil and aircraft with the Saudis. There is no awareness of the so-called Islamic Enlightenment, the subject of Christopher Bellaigue\u2019s book, cataloguing reformers in Egypt, Turkey and Iran who, from the 19th century, embraced industrialisation and struggled in support of political constitutionalism, scientific inquiry and gender equality. None of this would concern Johnson, because his anti-Islam statements only shore up his political base in the short term, regardless of historical reality. But \u201cspeaking your mind\u201d based on proven ignorance is no way to engage in meaningful political dialogue with a quarter of the world\u2019s population. Let\u2019s see how successful that is as a strategy for Johnson over the coming years. \u2022 Jerry Brotton is professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary University of London",

The hawk-moths are spectacular. The drab khaki and dusty-pink striped elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila elpenor) is the most familiar. Elephant refers not to its size but to its caterpillars, which supposedly resemble elephants\u2019 trunks. It looks small beside the privet hawk-moth (Sphinx ligustri), which, with a wingspan of up to 12cm, is Britain\u2019s largest resident species. This specimen must be nearly that big. Its huge, elongated, furry abdomen is banded rose carmine and black like some carnival hornet. Sphinx ligustri is often found in Dorset woods and gardens, where it feeds on nectar from night-scented flowers. July is the month its massive caterpillars will be hatching. Lime green with white and lilac side flashes, their soft, yoghurt-gum bodies culminate in a black and yellow tail horn. These larvae eat lilac, viburnum, holly and ash saplings as well as privet. The true dark star is the eyed hawk-moth. We gently coax it on to a hand, where it slowly wakes, unfurls long antenna lined with bristly filaments, and starts to vibrate its wings to warm up its flight muscles. As it revs up, its hind-wings open fully, revealing a startling pair of blue \u201ceyes\u201d on a flushed background. It doesn\u2019t let us admire it for long. With a flip of its abdomen, it suddenly defecates thick blobs of yellow before taking off into a shadowy bay tree hangar to wait out the daylight hours.",

The move, agreed in conjunction with the kingdom, aims to boost regional security as tensions in the Gulf mount over Iran\u2019s standoff with the US over sanctions and the 2015 nuclear agreement, and Tehran\u2019s seizure of two British-linked vessels in the strait of Hormuz on Friday. Saudi Arabia\u2019s defence ministry confirmed the deployment. \u201cBased on mutual cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America, and their desire to enhance everything that could preserve the security of the region and its stability ... King Salman gave his approval to host American forces,\u201d a ministry spokesman was quoted by Saudi state news agency SPA as saying. In June, the Pentagon said it would deploy 1,000 troops to the Middle East but did not say where they were going. Saudi Arabia has not hosted US forces since 2003 when they withdrew following the end of the war with Iraq. That US presence in Saudi Arabia lasted 12 years, starting with Operation Desert Storm in 1991, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. As many as 200 US aircraft were stationed at the Prince Sultan air base, around 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital at the peak of the Iraq war, and as many as 2,700 missions a day were handled by the headquarters in Saudi Arabia. But relations between the two countries were not always easy during the 12 years of cooperation, particularly following the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York which were orchestrated by Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Tensions in the Gulf increased further on Friday when Iran said it had seized two British-flagged tankers in the strait of Hormuz. Iran\u2019s revolutionary Guard claimed to have taken the British-flagged Stena Impero into port after Iranian officials said it had infringed maritime regulations. The ship\u2019s owners said the vessel had been \u201capproached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter during transit of the strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters\u201d. A second tanker, the Mesdar, which is Liberian-flagged but British operated, also made a sudden diversion from its course towards the Saudi port of Ras Tanura on Friday, and tracking data showed it moving northwards towards the Iranian coast before apparently turning off its tracking signal. Iran\u2019s semi-official news agency, Fars, reported the ship was briefly detained in the strait of Hormuz and given a notice to comply with environmental regulations before being allowed to continue on its way. The incidents in the strait of Hormuz came as US President Donald Trump insisted that the US military had downed an Iranian drone that was threatening a US naval vessel, despite denials from Tehran.

      "body": "<p>On 20 July 1969, when Neil Armstrong first stepped onto the surface of the moon, the footage was relayed to 600 million viewers \u2013 about one-fifth of humanity in 1969 \u2013 from Nasa\u2019s Honeysuckle Creek tracking station on the outskirts of Canberra.</p> \n<p>It was a big achievement for a small country with no space program of its own. Now, 50 years on, Australia has a fledgling space agency \u2013 a minnow compared with the US\u2019s Nasa, Europe\u2019s ESA and Japan\u2019s JAXA \u2013 but what it lacks in size it is hoping to make up for with a smart operating strategy and a bold vision of what it might be able to achieve.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.industry.gov.au/strategies-for-the-future/australian-space-agency\">Australian Space Agency</a> (ASA) deputy director, Anthony Murfett, says that the anniversary provides a chance to look back and be \u201cproud of the role we played\u201d but it\u2019s also a good time to be \u201clooking at what the next 50 years will mean.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/19/they-nailed-it-how-a-little-dish-in-australia-broadcast-the-moon-landing-to-the-world\">'They nailed it': how a little dish in Australia broadcast the moon landing to the world</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Australia\u2019s role in the moon landing was almost a gift of geography. Nasa was using a series of large dish-shaped antennas \u2013 in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, central Spain and south-eastern Australia \u2013 to receive the signals from the Apollo lunar module. A global network was needed as the moon was only above the horizon and within the sights of each dish for half of every day.</p> \n<p>California\u2019s 64m Goldstone dish and Australia\u2019s 64m dish at Parkes, about 400km west of Sydney in NSW, were the ones intended to relay the footage back to Houston and the world, but an over-eager Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin decided to skip a rest break and prepare for their moon walk five hours earlier than expected.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f75c957f-2628-4e2f-b48e-d16170b3bd0e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tIogywOrv8s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe fact that they elected to go early meant that the moon hadn\u2019t risen on the US facility and so there was no alternative but to go through Australia and Honeysuckle Creek,\u201d says Professor Fred Watson, a former astronomer at the Australian Astronomical Observatory in Coonabarabran, NSW, and now Australia\u2019s government-appointed astronomer-at-large. \u201cThe Parkes dish couldn\u2019t get down to sufficiently low elevation to pick up the moon, whereas Honeysuckle Creek could.\u201d</p> \n<p>That smaller 26m dish was better positioned to point itself towards the horizon and was therefore the source of much of the first eight minutes of footage, including Armstrong\u2019s first steps. Once the moon began to rise in the sky, Parkes took over providing the footage for the next two-and-a-half hours of lunar exploration.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ee3d62f7de10d4903b1c85b958eeacf8ea7849f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee3d62f7de10d4903b1c85b958eeacf8ea7849f/0_130_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Buzz Aldrin pictured during the Apollo 11 moonwalk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buzz Aldrin pictured during the Apollo 11 moonwalk.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Watson describes the moon landings as a monumental achievement and one of the defining moments in the history of our species. The crucial role Australia played in receiving and relaying the footage has everything to do with our unique position in a relatively remote spot of the southern hemisphere, and this is why we will continue to play a vital role in exploration and observation of space in the decades ahead.</p> \n<h2>A \u2018privileged position\u2019</h2> \n<p>\u201cIn Australia we have a privileged geographical position, being in the southern hemisphere, which is mostly ocean. There are only a number of places you can place antennas at particular longitudes \u2013 not just radio antennas, but also optical telescopes as well,\u201d explains Watson, who is also the author of upcoming book <a href=\"https://www.newsouthbooks.com.au/books/cosmic-addiction/\">Cosmic Chronicles: A user\u2019s guide to the Universe</a>.</p> \n<p>This is one reason why the former Australian Astronomical Observatory \u2013 now the Siding Spring Observatory with the Anglo-Australian Telescope \u2013 has been a lynchpin in many research programs. \u201cYou\u2019re filling a gap in the longitude distribution of facilities. And being in that region on Earth is exactly what allowed Australia to play a crucial role in the lunar landings,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Is it precisely this fact the ASA is leveraging as it encourages collaborations with industry and space agencies across the world, Murfett explains. \u201cAustralia played an instrumental role in broadcasting that signal of Neil Armstrong and his first steps on the moon \u2013 and that signified a role that Australia can play with its unique location in the southern hemisphere.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Not only do we have a geographic competitive advantage \u2026 we also have a technical competitive advantage</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Anthony Murfett</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Australia\u2019s \u201cunique view into the galaxy\u201d, gives us a significant competitive advantage over other regions and this is why \u2013 through the work of the CSIRO \u2013 Australia has continued to play a role in many space programs, and dishes including Parkes and another at Tidbinbilla, near Canberra, are still today critical parts of the Nasa\u2019s Deep Space Network, an international array of giant radio antennas which allow communications with interplanetary spacecraft.</p> \n<p>Australia, for example, now has the only stations that can still communicate with the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which was launched in 1977, but has now passed well beyond the bounds of the solar system, being around 18bn kilometres \u2013 or 120 times the distance between Earth and the sun.</p> \n<p>In addition to the relative radio quietness of the location, this is also why the Square Kilometre Array \u2013 which will be the world\u2019s largest radio telescope once completed \u2013 is partly based in Western Australia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00e8ac90f358819d55d095961fb79f8d2f530bc4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00e8ac90f358819d55d095961fb79f8d2f530bc4/0_135_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder telescope in Western Australia\u2019s mid-west region.

But it is leveraging Australia\u2019s unique geographic position to foster links with international space agencies and the aerospace industry via its International Space Investment Initiative and providing funding for entrepreneurs and start-ups through its Space Infrastructure Fund.</p> \n<h2>Commercial focus</h2> \n<p>Described by its director, Dr Megan Clark, as the most industry-focused of all the world\u2019s space agencies, the ASA has a stated goal of growing Australia\u2019s space industry from a current $3.9bn to $12bn by 2030, hopefully creating 20,000 new jobs in the process.</p> \n<p>The approach is different from most agencies. \u201cRather than running big research and development programs, we are looking at ways to grow the space economy as an industry to be self-sustaining,\u201d Murfett says.</p> \n<p>While there was already a lot of great space flight-related research in Australia, the ASA is now a much-needed umbrella organisation that provides a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d to focus and galvanise our efforts, Watson says. Nasa, too, has begun to increasingly work with commercial providers, such as SpaceX, whose reusable Dragon spacecraft delivers cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).</p> \n<p>It is not just Australia\u2019s geographic position that the agency is leveraging \u2013 Australian universities and aerospace companies already excelled in a number of space-related areas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0455e6953d20ca820b995cb6327d4dca1fc48411\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0455e6953d20ca820b995cb6327d4dca1fc48411/151_552_3080_1848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The launch of a hypersonic HIFiRE 5b rocket at the Woomera Test Range in South Australia on May 18, 2016.

There are already plans to <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=e4d0ca922383ab99a12d1a6836a06652&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">launch sounding rockets</a> \u2013 to perform scientific experiments in the upper atmosphere \u2013 from Arnhem Land. Nasa is in talks with Aussie firm Equatorial Launch Australia about the possibility of launches in the near future, and other kinds of launches will soon follow.</p> \n<p>Two further companies \u2013 Gilmour Space Technologies in Queensland and Southern Launch in South Australia \u2013 are developing opportunities for commercial launches</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f0a94738ea1180ad567d0d4d481c4358ee7f0a5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f0a94738ea1180ad567d0d4d481c4358ee7f0a5/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three CubeSats pictured shortly after being ejected from a Japanese spacecraft in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three CubeSats pictured shortly after being ejected from a Japanese spacecraft in 2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>CubeSats, mining and robotics</h2> \n<p>Another area where Australia leads the world is robotics and remote operation of robots, particularly in mine sites, such as Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara. Earlier this month, Clark announced a joint commitment of $8m from the federal and WA governments to develop a WA-based mission control centre for controlling robots and autonomous systems in space.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot only do we have a geographic competitive advantage \u2026 we also have a technical competitive advantage based on some of the other things we\u2019re seeing in the economy,\u201d Murfett adds.</p> \n<p>The University of Sydney is also partnering with a Japanese startup to launch two CubeSats \u2013 miniature satellites that operate in low-Earth orbit \u2013 from the ISS.</p> \n<p>These are just a smattering of some of the future projects under way. \u201cThe future for Australia in space is pretty bright,\u201d says Watson.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re at a very exciting time for the Australian space industry,\u201d Murfett says. \u201cThe 50th anniversary of the moon landing gives us a chance to reflect \u2026 and is now an opportunity to look forward to what can be achieved next in our space activities.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>John Pickrell is a science journalist and author based in Sydney.

Now, 50 years on, Australia has a fledgling space agency \u2013 a minnow compared with the US\u2019s Nasa, Europe\u2019s ESA and Japan\u2019s JAXA \u2013 but what it lacks in size it is hoping to make up for with a smart operating strategy and a bold vision of what it might be able to achieve. The Australian Space Agency (ASA) deputy director, Anthony Murfett, says that the anniversary provides a chance to look back and be \u201cproud of the role we played\u201d but it\u2019s also a good time to be \u201clooking at what the next 50 years will mean.\u201d Australia\u2019s role in the moon landing was almost a gift of geography. Nasa was using a series of large dish-shaped antennas \u2013 in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, central Spain and south-eastern Australia \u2013 to receive the signals from the Apollo lunar module. A global network was needed as the moon was only above the horizon and within the sights of each dish for half of every day. California\u2019s 64m Goldstone dish and Australia\u2019s 64m dish at Parkes, about 400km west of Sydney in NSW, were the ones intended to relay the footage back to Houston and the world, but an over-eager Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin decided to skip a rest break and prepare for their moon walk five hours earlier than expected. \u201cThe fact that they elected to go early meant that the moon hadn\u2019t risen on the US facility and so there was no alternative but to go through Australia and Honeysuckle Creek,\u201d says Professor Fred Watson, a former astronomer at the Australian Astronomical Observatory in Coonabarabran, NSW, and now Australia\u2019s government-appointed astronomer-at-large. \u201cThe Parkes dish couldn\u2019t get down to sufficiently low elevation to pick up the moon, whereas Honeysuckle Creek could.\u201d That smaller 26m dish was better positioned to point itself towards the horizon and was therefore the source of much of the first eight minutes of footage, including Armstrong\u2019s first steps. Once the moon began to rise in the sky, Parkes took over providing the footage for the next two-and-a-half hours of lunar exploration. Watson describes the moon landings as a monumental achievement and one of the defining moments in the history of our species. The crucial role Australia played in receiving and relaying the footage has everything to do with our unique position in a relatively remote spot of the southern hemisphere, and this is why we will continue to play a vital role in exploration and observation of space in the decades ahead. A \u2018privileged position\u2019 \u201cIn Australia we have a privileged geographical position, being in the southern hemisphere, which is mostly ocean. There are only a number of places you can place antennas at particular longitudes \u2013 not just radio antennas, but also optical telescopes as well,\u201d explains Watson, who is also the author of upcoming book Cosmic Chronicles: A user\u2019s guide to the Universe. This is one reason why the former Australian Astronomical Observatory \u2013 now the Siding Spring Observatory with the Anglo-Australian Telescope \u2013 has been a lynchpin in many research programs. \u201cYou\u2019re filling a gap in the longitude distribution of facilities. And being in that region on Earth is exactly what allowed Australia to play a crucial role in the lunar landings,\u201d he says. Is it precisely this fact the ASA is leveraging as it encourages collaborations with industry and space agencies across the world, Murfett explains. \u201cAustralia played an instrumental role in broadcasting that signal of Neil Armstrong and his first steps on the moon \u2013 and that signified a role that Australia can play with its unique location in the southern hemisphere.\u201d Australia\u2019s \u201cunique view into the galaxy\u201d, gives us a significant competitive advantage over other regions and this is why \u2013 through the work of the CSIRO \u2013 Australia has continued to play a role in many space programs, and dishes including Parkes and another at Tidbinbilla, near Canberra, are still today critical parts of the Nasa\u2019s Deep Space Network, an international array of giant radio antennas which allow communications with interplanetary spacecraft. Australia, for example, now has the only stations that can still communicate with the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which was launched in 1977, but has now passed well beyond the bounds of the solar system, being around 18bn kilometres \u2013 or 120 times the distance between Earth and the sun. In addition to the relative radio quietness of the location, this is also why the Square Kilometre Array \u2013 which will be the world\u2019s largest radio telescope once completed \u2013 is partly based in Western Australia. The Australian Space Agency, launched in July 2018, has an incredibly modest budget \u2013 around A$73m over the next six years, compared with Nasa\u2019s annual budget of about US$20bn. But it is leveraging Australia\u2019s unique geographic position to foster links with international space agencies and the aerospace industry via its International Space Investment Initiative and providing funding for entrepreneurs and start-ups through its Space Infrastructure Fund. Commercial focus Described by its director, Dr Megan Clark, as the most industry-focused of all the world\u2019s space agencies, the ASA has a stated goal of growing Australia\u2019s space industry from a current $3.9bn to $12bn by 2030, hopefully creating 20,000 new jobs in the process. The approach is different from most agencies. \u201cRather than running big research and development programs, we are looking at ways to grow the space economy as an industry to be self-sustaining,\u201d Murfett says. While there was already a lot of great space flight-related research in Australia, the ASA is now a much-needed umbrella organisation that provides a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d to focus and galvanise our efforts, Watson says. Nasa, too, has begun to increasingly work with commercial providers, such as SpaceX, whose reusable Dragon spacecraft delivers cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). It is not just Australia\u2019s geographic position that the agency is leveraging \u2013 Australian universities and aerospace companies already excelled in a number of space-related areas. Watson says that one area where \u201cpeople beat a pathway to our door\u201d is the development of hypersonic, air-breathing propulsion systems for rockets \u2013 supersonic combustion ramjets that could burn oxygen during their passage through the atmosphere, and which have yet to be properly exploited by the space industry. Another is the identification of space junk in orbit around the Earth, and possibly the future use of lasers fired from Australia to shift objects into safer orbits. \u201cWe need to understand what\u2019s in orbit, and again [because of its unique view into space] Australia does have a role it can play in space situational awareness and debris tracking,\u201d says Murfett. Suborbital space tourism launches from Australia is another future direction that has been mooted. There are already plans to launch sounding rockets \u2013 to perform scientific experiments in the upper atmosphere \u2013 from Arnhem Land. Nasa is in talks with Aussie firm Equatorial Launch Australia about the possibility of launches in the near future, and other kinds of launches will soon follow. Two further companies \u2013 Gilmour Space Technologies in Queensland and Southern Launch in South Australia \u2013 are developing opportunities for commercial launches CubeSats, mining and robotics Another area where Australia leads the world is robotics and remote operation of robots, particularly in mine sites, such as Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara. Earlier this month, Clark announced a joint commitment of $8m from the federal and WA governments to develop a WA-based mission control centre for controlling robots and autonomous systems in space. \u201cNot only do we have a geographic competitive advantage \u2026 we also have a technical competitive advantage based on some of the other things we\u2019re seeing in the economy,\u201d Murfett adds. The University of Sydney is also partnering with a Japanese startup to launch two CubeSats \u2013 miniature satellites that operate in low-Earth orbit \u2013 from the ISS. These are just a smattering of some of the future projects under way. \u201cThe future for Australia in space is pretty bright,\u201d says Watson. \u201cWe\u2019re at a very exciting time for the Australian space industry,\u201d Murfett says. \u201cThe 50th anniversary of the moon landing gives us a chance to reflect \u2026 and is now an opportunity to look forward to what can be achieved next in our space activities.\u201d \u2022 John Pickrell is a science journalist and author based in Sydney.
