      "bodyText": "Former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd anticipated a dangerous future of UK isolation caused by \u201cpoisonous\u201d internal divisions over the EU and advocated a policy of diplomatic \u201cpolygamy\u201d, government documents from a quarter of a century ago reveal. In a prescient, strategic paper released to the National Archives in Kew, Hurd warned that British attitudes towards the continent were tipping \u201cover into xenophobia\u201d at a time when international alliances were becoming ever more crucial. But even the prime minister of the day, John Major, a convinced Europhile, vented his exasperation in private at the byzantine politics of the European Union, the files show, confessing on one occasion that he was \u201csick and tired of playing by the rules\u201d. Hurd\u2019s analysis was delivered to a high-powered private seminar at Chequers on 2 September 1994, in the presence of Major, the defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind and select senior officials. As the UK agonises over Brexit, Hurd\u2019s prophetic warnings will reverberate forcefully. The immediate international challenges in 1994 were civil war in the former Yugoslavia and mass slaughter in Rwanda. \u201cThe world has undergone a seismic change,\u201d his confidential address began. \u201cThere is now one superpower but it is unwilling to impose solutions on disorder.\u201d Britain, \u201cas a medium-sized power\u201d, Hurd said, should best \u201cpursue our interests through multilateral organisations, buttressed by selected bilateral alliances. The European Union is the most important.\u201d The UK\u2019s three main partners, he said, are \u201cthe United States, Germany and France, for each of whom we are in danger of ranking third\u201d. He continued: \u201cThe main area of confusion in our foreign policy is Europe. Our public opinion is doubtful, most of our media hostile. The uncertainty over what we want weakens our ability to achieve our goals and make others hesitant to ally with us. We are seen as reluctant participants. This impression spreads outwards and weakens us in other areas too, eg with the United States.\u201d Hurd was confident that the UK was on the winning side of the argument in the EU debate between \u201cold-fashioned centralisers\u201d and wanting \u201ca wider, more flexible Europe\u201d. That part of his prediction may have proved somewhat too optimistic. The EU, though, he acknowledged, faced growing threats from drugs, crime and immigration. Hurd said: \u201cMeanwhile, debate in the UK remains poisonous and we are weakened as a country by it. It tips over into xenophobia, especially in the press, and this is what Europeans and others notice. The political parties are divided, ours more seriously than Labour. We are unable to give a lead to popular thinking. As a result we seem continuously bad-tempered and on the defensive.\u201d Summing up, the foreign secretary concluded: \u201cThe world and interests in it are too complex for us to rely on a single partner.

Modelled on the city\u2019s desirable Golden Triangle of Victorian terraced houses nearby, it borrows the narrow street width and friendly neighbourhood feel, with gardens backing on to a shared passageway, with benches and picnic tables, perfect for kids to play unsupervised.

A more high-octane kind of drama can be found further north, in the form of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners\u2019 billowing distillery and visitor experience for the Macallan whisky empire in Moray, on the northern coast of Scotland. The undisputed masters of exposed pipes have conjured a theatrical spectacle from the seething network of tubes, mash tuns, condensers and copper stills that go into making the amber liquor. With their usual hi-tech precision, the architects have transformed the prosaic production process into a series of set-piece stage sets with the glamour of scenes that Ken Adam might have dreamed up for James Bond or Dr Strangelove. It is all swept beneath a roof of grassy mounds that looks like the Teletubbies went hard on the scotch. It is an appropriately outre temple for a brand that produced the world\u2019s most expensive bottle of whisky, which sold last year for \u00a3848,000. While RSH+P have made an elaborate spectacle out of the simple process of distilling grain, Grimshaw architects have succeeded in unravelling the fiendishly complex knot of London Bridge station into something remarkably clear and straightforward. By scooping out the underbelly of Victorian railway vaults, they have created an airy open concourse, where the tracks bridge the space overhead, allowing natural light to flood down in between them. It is a refreshingly legible space, with pairs of long escalators rising to the platforms, while a new arcade of concrete vaults leads through to the Underground station. From the outside it is less successful, resorting to a weird kind of flattened Victorian pastiche, topped with the practice\u2019s trademark swoopy metal canopies, but with edges and junctions that don\u2019t quite glide as gracefully as they should. Goldsmith Street in Norwich could be the most significant development of them all. It is a scheme of 100% social housing \u2013 yes, proper council housing with secure tenancies and fixed rents \u2013 developed by Norwich city council and all built to Passivhaus specification, the gold standard for energy efficiency, chosen with tenants\u2019 fuel poverty in mind. Modelled on the city\u2019s desirable Golden Triangle of Victorian terraced houses nearby, it borrows the narrow street width and friendly neighbourhood feel, with gardens backing on to a shared passageway, with benches and picnic tables, perfect for kids to play unsupervised. The homes have been cleverly designed with an asymmetric roof that allows winter sunlight to reach houses behind, while details including glossy black tile roofs and buttery brickwork give it the handsome quality of a place in which real care has been invested. In its 23-year history, the Stirling prize has never been awarded to social housing \u2013 in part, because there hasn\u2019t been any to celebrate. But now, as local authorities across the country are busy building their own homes again for the first time in a generation, there couldn\u2019t be a better time to recognise the value of thoughtful design for those that need it most, and the bravery of councils that are leading the way. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 July 2019 because the Cork House in Berkshire will emit exceptionally low levels of carbon, but not next to zero carbon as an earlier version said.",

Major\u2019s private secretary regaled how the Russian president was \u201cv pissed off\u201d after an aborted phone call to Clinton, the then US president. \u201cApparently the Russians misunderstood all the preliminary soundings the US operations room do, and put Yeltsin on the line,\u201d wrote Roderic Lyne in recently revealed documents at the National Archives. \u201cPanic at the US end, no sign of Clinton. Yeltsin kept waiting for one-and-a-half hours before he gave up v pissed off. Hence refusal to take call from Clinton for next couple of days. (Pass on to PM if he not aware).\u201d Yeltsin\u2019s health attracted much comment. Notes from the British embassy interpreter during Major\u2019s 1994 Moscow visit described the Russian president, who had been confined to his dacha, as recovering from a chest cold and \u201ctwice coughed phlegm into his handkerchief\u201d during his one-to-one with Major. Yeltsin had lost weight, but was \u201cstill rather puffy around the neck and jaw\u201d. He ate \u201cselectively and moderately at the Kremlin dinner\u201d and \u201calso stayed off the vodka contenting himself with some large gulps of red wine,\u201d according to the note. He seemed to have \u201clost his former bounce\u201d and be \u201coperating on a fairly flat battery\u201d, and was equipped with \u201cclutch cards\u201d for reference during the meeting, which he \u201cseemed to have memorised as his points came out in the same rehearsed order\u201d. Clinton did not escape the barbed embassy missives. One confidential briefing document from the British embassy in Washington reported that stories of Clinton\u2019s personal life \u201chave taken their toll\u201d and the thought he might have to testify in court \u201cgives the White House fits\u201d. \u201cWhite House organisation remains chaotic\u201d, the briefing added, with several departures expected \u201cand the political team still trying to operate as if they were in a campaign\u201d. On Clinton and foreign policy, it stated: \u201cThe president enjoys thinking about, discussing and talking issues to death. He tries not to make up his mind until the last possible moment. It has proved much easier to get away with this in domestic than foreign affairs. \u201cClinton is interested in foreign issues, but he has much less of an instinctive feel for them. Instead of talking softly and carrying a big stick, he is accused of talking loudly, then failing to act.\u201d He was concerned about his treatment in the UK press. Hillary Clinton was described as \u201chighly intelligent and very highly motivated\u201d. Clinton\u2019s impressions of the then Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, as conveyed to Major, were detailed in a confidential No 10 note. The US president thought Berlusconi had popular appeal \u201cwith his six sports teams (and eight champions playing in the World Cup team)\u201d and his \u201cdrop-dead cinch ex-actress wife\u201d, it said. One memo from the then British ambassador in Pretoria, Sir Anthony Reeve, relayed hitches in Mitterrand\u2019s state visit to South Africa. He wrote: \u201cIt bore the hallmarks of a hastily arranged programme. The French were disappointed that deputy president [FW] de Klerk chose not to disrupt his Wimbledon/holiday plans.\u201d While the then deputy South African president Thabo Mbeki \u201csimply failed to turn up for his breakfast meeting with Mitterrand (he was abroad)\u201c. The memo continued: \u201cA particularly awkward moment occurred at the state banquet when President [Nelson] Mandela decided to leave at 22.00, halfway through the soup (Mitterrand having delayed the dinner with a lengthy and mostly off-the-cuff speech)\u201d. Major, ahead of a visit to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 1994, was provided with unvarnished profiles of the country\u2019s leadership. Prince Majid-Abdul bin Abdul-Aziz was described as formerly having \u201ca reputation for laziness\u201d, and as a \u201creluctant governor who has let his province drift\u201d. King Fahd, who was praised for being \u201cextremely shrewd\u201d, was also portrayed as prone to \u201creact badly to contrary advice. Prince Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz was said to be charming but also \u201cinflexible and imperious\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Prime ministers from Winston Churchill to Harold Macmillan raised concerns at the length of time and rising costs of refurbishing Downing Street, which overran budget and time estimates due to labour disputes, documents show. A survey under Churchill in 1954 discovered dry rot and beetle damage, with risk of Nos 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street partially collapsing. Urgent underpinning and restoration was required for the buildings, built in the 1680s. Churchill wrote: \u201cI am shocked that the Ministry of Works contemplates two or three years. The Ark did not take so long.\u201d On his signed typed note, he scribbled: \u201cAntediluvian\u201d, newly released documents at the National Archives show. Surveys found the buildings worse than feared. The cabinet room, according to one memo, would have collapsed years before \u201chad it not been shored up from below during the war to provide a bomb shelter in the basement\u201d. The reconstruction eventually began in 1960, with the then prime minister, Macmillan, decamping to nearby Admiralty House until completion in 1963. Costs soared as work was disrupted by strikes and work-to-rules over unpaid tea breaks. An incentive bonus was introduced to get rapid completion. On the increased costs, Macmillan wrote: \u201cThis is very bad,\u201d adding: \u201cShows what is wrong with this country.\u201d The total bill, for building and for furnishings and decorating, was estimated at \u00a32.5m in late 1962. \u201cThis is a terrible story, but makes it all the more necessary that the architects furnishings and decorating extravagances shd be curbed,\u201d wrote Macmillan.

When the weather conditions are right, they go into the air.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/weather\">weather in the south of England</a> has triggered what is known as the \u201cnuptial flight\u201d phase of the ant\u2019s reproductive cycle \u2013 commonly referred to as a \u201cflying ant day\u201d.</p> <p>But Prof Hart argues that the term is misleading as the mating ritual can last for several weeks throughout July and August, depending on the weather conditions in different parts of the country, ultimately involving billions of ants.</p> <p>The ants typically take to the skies when rainfall is followed by hot, humid weather.

      "bodyText": "Huge swarms of flying ants that hit England\u2019s south coast were mistaken by weather satellites in space for clouds of rain. The Met Office\u2019s radar captured what it described as \u201cinsect clutter\u201d over the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and Dorset on Wednesday morning. They were also spotted in East Sussex and Kent. \u201cIt\u2019s all about mating,\u201d insect expert Prof Adam Hart of the University of Gloucestershire said. \u201cThe ant colonies in the ground are busy rearing the potential new queens and males. When the weather conditions are right, they go into the air.\u201d The weather in the south of England has triggered what is known as the \u201cnuptial flight\u201d phase of the ant\u2019s reproductive cycle \u2013 commonly referred to as a \u201cflying ant day\u201d. But Prof Hart argues that the term is misleading as the mating ritual can last for several weeks throughout July and August, depending on the weather conditions in different parts of the country, ultimately involving billions of ants. The ants typically take to the skies when rainfall is followed by hot, humid weather. The queen emits pheromones as she takes flight, encouraging the males to pursue her. But only the strongest are able to mate with her. As the queen flees their advances, birds swoop in and prey upon them. The chase is intended to ensure that the queen\u2019s offspring are as fit as they can be. \u201cThe ones that don\u2019t get eaten by birds fall to the ground and lose their wings,\u201d Prof Hart said. \u201cThe queen then digs a little hole and tries to start a new colony \u2026 It is one of nature\u2019s spectacles. It is fantastic to see the exuberance of nature.\u201d A Met Office spokesperson said the ants showed up on their image as showers of rain because \u201cthe radar thinks the beams are hitting raindrops, not ants\u201d. Flying ants are harmless to humans, but it has been reported that they can have a strange effect on seagulls, who can appear drunk after eating a few. \u201cSome think it\u2019s to do with the formic acid in the ants,\u201d said Hart. \u201cBut the jury is still out on that one.\u201d He suspects the satellite sighting of the swarms is more likely attributable to increasingly sophisticated technology than to an increase in the ant population. \u201cIf it is increasing, I think it is a potentially a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would be cautious to interpret that.\u201d",

The second biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a> outbreak ever, after the 2014-16 epidemic in West Africa, has reached a critical point with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/15/ebola-virus-reaches-congolese-city-of-goma\">the diagnosis of a case in Goma</a>, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said WHO is working on a new plan to control the epidemic which would cost \u201chundred of millions\u201d of dollars. \u201cIt is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system,\u201d said Tedros.</p> <p><strong>Australia should dramatically decrease its oil use to ward off a potential crisis,</strong> the Australia Institute has warned, listing options such as tightening fuel-efficiency standards, introducing electric vehicle targets and increasing public transport use. As of December 2018, Australia held only 18 days of petrol, 22 days of diesel and 23 days of jet fuel reserves, according to federal government figures. In the event of disruption, emergency powers to ration fuel stocks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/17/australia-urged-to-move-away-from-oil-dependency-or-risk-fuel-supply-crisis\">would take up to three weeks</a> to kick in. \u201cAustralia is an international laggard when it comes to fuel efficiency,\u201d the Australia Institute\u2019s energy program director, Richie Merzian, told the Guardian. \u201cWeak fuel standards and an absence of a national electric vehicle policy leave Australia among the least fuel-efficient fleets in the OECD.\u201d</p> <p><strong>State and territory governments have presided over the loss of more than 20,000 public housing units in a decade,</strong> marking a \u201cconsiderable change\u201d as control over social housing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/18/australia-lost-20000-public-housing-units-in-a-decade-study-finds\">is increasingly handed to non-profits</a>. A new study, released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on Thursday, found the declining number of publicly owned homes was offset by a 55,470 increase in homes run by non-profit providers. Although overall social housing, which includes government and non-profit-run stock, increased by about 27,401 \u2013 or about 6% \u2013 over the 10 years to 2017-18, the study found the increase had \u201cnot kept pace with the growth in households\u201d. That meant about a quarter of new public housing tenants in 2017-18 who were classified as in \u201cgreatest need\u201d had been on the waiting list longer than 12 months, with 13% waiting longer than two years to be housed.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c428ba844c01c76bb3f1a0a4a958c0aeccce747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c428ba844c01c76bb3f1a0a4a958c0aeccce747/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screengrab of archive video of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at a party in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screengrab of archive video of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at a party in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MSNBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Footage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/trump-jeffrey-epstein-party-footage-surfaces\">Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at a party</a> has surfaced after the president tried to distance himself from the wealthy financier</strong> who was arrested earlier this month over the alleged sex trafficking of minors.

His name was Neil Armstrong and his astonishing act of creativity is a photograph of his Apollo 11 crewmate Buzz Aldrin standing on the Sea of Tranquillity on the moon. Not that you can see Aldrin\u2019s face. His features and flesh are hidden inside a thickly padded white spacesuit, its visor reflecting the tiny figure of Armstrong himself, beside the gold-coloured legs of the lunar lander.</p> <p>This effacement of Aldrin came about because Apollo astronauts wore visors lined with gold to protect their eyes from sunlight. Yet these reflective qualities are part of what makes this such a powerful, complex image, one in which we can see two lunar horizons.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 18 July. Top stories The Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization has declared, calling for more funds and international support to close it down. The second biggest Ebola outbreak ever, after the 2014-16 epidemic in West Africa, has reached a critical point with the diagnosis of a case in Goma, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said WHO is working on a new plan to control the epidemic which would cost \u201chundred of millions\u201d of dollars. \u201cIt is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system,\u201d said Tedros. Australia should dramatically decrease its oil use to ward off a potential crisis, the Australia Institute has warned, listing options such as tightening fuel-efficiency standards, introducing electric vehicle targets and increasing public transport use. As of December 2018, Australia held only 18 days of petrol, 22 days of diesel and 23 days of jet fuel reserves, according to federal government figures. In the event of disruption, emergency powers to ration fuel stocks would take up to three weeks to kick in. \u201cAustralia is an international laggard when it comes to fuel efficiency,\u201d the Australia Institute\u2019s energy program director, Richie Merzian, told the Guardian. \u201cWeak fuel standards and an absence of a national electric vehicle policy leave Australia among the least fuel-efficient fleets in the OECD.\u201d State and territory governments have presided over the loss of more than 20,000 public housing units in a decade, marking a \u201cconsiderable change\u201d as control over social housing is increasingly handed to non-profits. A new study, released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on Thursday, found the declining number of publicly owned homes was offset by a 55,470 increase in homes run by non-profit providers. Although overall social housing, which includes government and non-profit-run stock, increased by about 27,401 \u2013 or about 6% \u2013 over the 10 years to 2017-18, the study found the increase had \u201cnot kept pace with the growth in households\u201d. That meant about a quarter of new public housing tenants in 2017-18 who were classified as in \u201cgreatest need\u201d had been on the waiting list longer than 12 months, with 13% waiting longer than two years to be housed. World Footage of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at a party has surfaced after the president tried to distance himself from the wealthy financier who was arrested earlier this month over the alleged sex trafficking of minors. The friendly exchange between the pair happens while they are surrounded by young women and shows Trump pointing out women to Epstein. Drug makers and distributors flooded the US with more than 75bn opioid pills as the country\u2019s epidemic of painkiller addiction and deaths surged to record levels, according to previously secret data released by an American court. The UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said it is \u201cterrifying\u201d that Boris Johnson ally Jacob Rees-Mogg believes a no-deal Brexit will boost the economy. Johnson, meanwhile, revealed his support for the European Union\u2019s single market in \u201ca pro-European\u201d letter written the year before he decided to campaign for leave. The owner of high street fashion chain Zara has announced that all of its collections will be made from 100% sustainable fabrics before 2025. Inditex \u2013 the world\u2019s third largest apparel company \u2013 said its other brands, including Zara Home, Massimo Dutti and Pull&amp;Bear, will follow suit. Opinion and analysis Stephanie Wood, the author of Fake, Guardian Australia\u2019s new Unmissable book, says her story is far more than \u2018lonely childless woman who fell for a con artist\u2019. She writes that a \u201cflim-flam man had led me to believe he was an affluent farmer and property developer. He had spurred me to think we might have a future together. He turned out to be nothing more than a fantasist, a small, hollow man with a great capacity to inflict suffering.\u201d The government\u2019s tax plan will massively reduce the progressive nature of the tax system and also cause a large cut to the government tax base, writes Greg Jericho, but they will also increase inequality. Lower tax rates leading to lower tax revenue requiring lower government spending on services is the point of the policy, not a side effect. It will make for a very different Australia \u2013 one much less equal, and one where people will be expected to pay for services they currently take for granted will be provided by the public. Sport The 25-year-old Sydneysider Caleb Ewan has won the Tour de France stage 11, despite the Australian\u2019s usual lead-out man, Jasper De Buyst, tumbling into a ditch a few kilometres from the finish. Ewan, who rides for the Lotto-Soudal team, has now won stages in all three Grand Tours, having led the peloton across the line in stage five of the 2015 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and done so three times in the Giro d\u2019Italia, including twice this year. The Socceroos will face some familiar foes on their path to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, after being drawn with Nepal, Jordan, Taiwan and Kuwait in the second stage of Asian qualifiers. Thinking time: Why the moon landing shots are artistic masterpieces Fifty years ago this week, a former navy pilot created one of the most revolutionary artistic masterpieces of the 20th century, one we have yet to fully assimilate. His name was Neil Armstrong and his astonishing act of creativity is a photograph of his Apollo 11 crewmate Buzz Aldrin standing on the Sea of Tranquillity on the moon. Not that you can see Aldrin\u2019s face. His features and flesh are hidden inside a thickly padded white spacesuit, its visor reflecting the tiny figure of Armstrong himself, beside the gold-coloured legs of the lunar lander. This effacement of Aldrin came about because Apollo astronauts wore visors lined with gold to protect their eyes from sunlight. Yet these reflective qualities are part of what makes this such a powerful, complex image, one in which we can see two lunar horizons. Behind Aldrin, the moon\u2019s bright surface recedes to a blue horizon against the black void of space. Meanwhile, reflected and warped by the helmet, the other horizon stretches away behind Armstrong. The photographer has incorporated the making of the image into the image, to tell the story of something new in the universe: two human beings looking at each other across the dusty surface of an alien world. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reveals that the number of outright homeowners in New South Wales has collapsed by a third over the past two decades. A personal tale: How GetUp and Unions tried to break me, is a headline on the Australian\u2019s front page, with the Liberal backbencher Nicolle Flint McVeigh describing \u201ca concerted attack to destroy me mentally\u201d during the federal election. \u201cHe\u2019ll be chuffed to bits\u201d, declares the ABC after finding the author of a letter written in 1969, secured in a bottle and tossed into the Indian Ocean, which was discovered by a nine-year-old boy washed up on a South Australian beach on Wednesday. Coming up The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will attend a bush summit in Dubbo to discuss the drought. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, is in Melbourne to deliver a speech on how her government is dealing with an environment of growing uncertainty and declining trust in government. She will meet with the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews. Sign up If you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.",

      "bodyText": "Frankie Dettori\u2019s flying visit to Killarney racecourse on Wednesday evening did not result in any flying dismounts, as the most familiar face in racing failed to find a winner in four attempts. Dettori had arrived at the course in a pony-and-trap, just as Lester Piggott had done on a famous visit to the Irish track in the 1990s. Piggott too had four rides at the County Kerry course, and won with three of them. Unlike his predecessor as racing\u2019s most famous jockey, Dettori failed to find a winner in front of a huge crowd, instead chalking up two second-place finishes. Dettori\u2019s evening started with a near-miss on Time Tunnel, an 11-4 shot, who was drawn out wide but was soon at the head of affairs. Dettori held the advantage until well inside the final furlong, when Tauran Shaman ran him down to win by half a length. Hopes that Dettori was just starting to find his way around Killarney were dashed when his next mount, Mujid, was only fourth of five at 100-30. Lady Wannabe\u2019s performance in the Listed Cairn Rouge Stakes, the card\u2019s feature event, proved to be the most exciting of the night for Dettori\u2019s backers. As he had on Time Tunnel, Dettori took control from an early stage and this time he was in front until the final strides, when Colin Keane forced Viadera\u2019s head in front on the line to win by a short-head. Dettori\u2019s final ride, Finding Nero, started favourite at 2-1 but never seriously threatened to take a hand in the finish. Dettori hadn\u2019t ridden in Kerry since 1998, when he drew a crowd of 6,000 to the now-defunct course at Tralee, and he arrived at Killarney in the middle of one of his most successful seasons for many years.

      "bodyText": "The Louvre museum in Paris has removed the name of the art philanthropist family Sackler from a major wing devoted to eastern antiquities. The Sackler name came down this month after a protest by the US art photographer and activist Nan Goldin, who said it should be removed from gallery walls because some members of the multibillionaire family had benefited from the business of addictive painkillers. The Louvre said the reason the name had come down was that the legal period of donors\u2019 name rights was over. After targeting other US and UK art institutions, Goldin demonstrated outside the Louvre demanding it rename the Sackler wing of eastern antiquities because one branch of the family is accused of profiting from the US opioid crisis, being the owners of the American pharmaceutical company that produces the highly addictive prescription painkiller OxyContin. Goldin, along with Paris-based activists affiliated with her campaign group, Pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now), waded into the fountains beneath the Louvre\u2019s pyramid with more than a dozen activists carrying red banners reading \u201ctake down the Sackler name\u201d. The group said the Louvre \u2013 the world\u2019s most visited museum \u2013 should have been the first major museum to remove the name from its galleries. At the time of the protest on 1 July, the Sackler name was still on the museum walls as well as its website. The Louvre\u2019s Sackler wing was made up of 12 rooms of near eastern antiquities, including key pieces from the museum\u2019s Persian collection. On Wednesday, the Louvre confirmed in a written statement that the Sackler name had come down from the wing because the legal time-period of name-rights had ended.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Arsenal</strong></h2> <p><strong>Bukayo Saka, 17</strong>, <strong>winger</strong></p> <p>Announced himself in style with a well-taken finish in the friendly win over Colorado Rapids this week and has been tipped to follow in the footsteps of Joe Willock, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe, who have all been officially promoted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/arsenal-freddie-ljungberg\" title=\"\">to the first-team squad</a>. Saka does not turn 18 until September but made his senior debut against Vorskla in the Europa League last season after starring for Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s under-23s. He has also been utilised as a full-back in the past, although his future looks likely to be further up the pitch. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <h2><strong>Aston Villa</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/13/premier-league-transfers-club-by-club-guide\">Premier League transfers so far this summer and what each club still needs</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Jack Clarke, 20, midfielder</strong></p> <p>His namesake may have earned a \u00a310m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/26/tottenham-sign-jack-clarke-leeds-spurs-medical-ryan-sessegnon\" title=\"\">move to Tottenham </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/26/tottenham-sign-jack-clarke-leeds-spurs-medical-ryan-sessegnon\" title=\"\">this summer</a> but the boyhood Villa fan has been given a chance to impress by Dean Smith.

Has risen through the ranks with Callum O\u2019Hare, Andre Green and \u201cbest friend\u201d Jake Doyle-Hayes. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <h2><strong>Bournemouth</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mark Travers, 20, goalkeeper</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/may/04/bournemouth-v-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">Outstanding on debut against Tottenham in May</a>, 18 months on from a successful loan spell at Weymouth. The Republic of Ireland international has caught the eye of Mick McCarthy and is extremely highly regarded by Eddie Howe. Travers finished last season in between the sticks and could yet start this campaign as the first\u2011choice goalkeeper. Progress set to be rewarded with a long-term contract. <strong>BF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Brighton</strong></h2> <p><strong>Aaron Connolly, 19, striker</strong></p> <p>Prolific at youth level, the Galway\u2011born forward is determined to make a first-team breakthrough under Graham Potter. Connolly, who joined Brighton as a scholar three years ago \u2013 shortly after a trial at Manchester United \u2013 was quickly fast-tracked into the under-23 side, for whom he scored 17 goals in 20 appearances last season. He finished last term on loan at Luton, making two appearances. <strong>BF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Burnley</strong></h2> <p><strong>Josh Benson, 19, midfielder</strong></p> <p>Has yet to make a first-team appearance for Burnley but the midfielder has featured in the club\u2019s pre-season preparation in Portugal and could soon find himself named in matchday squads. While Sean Dyche will not be rushed, Benson is the same age as Dwight McNeil, who made his breakthrough last season and is now being linked with Juventus. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7694ae0d5e378d3965ffefc0552774258ae39ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7694ae0d5e378d3965ffefc0552774258ae39ca/0_86_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea's Mason Mount holds up his hand to signify the five-year contract he has just signed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mason Mount has signed a new five-year contract at Chelsea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Howes - Chelsea FC/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chelsea</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mason Mount, 20, midfielder</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/15/mason-mount-chelsea-five-year-deal\" title=\"\">Signed a new five-year contract worth around \u00a375,000</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/15/mason-mount-chelsea-five-year-deal\" title=\"\"> a</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/15/mason-mount-chelsea-five-year-deal\" title=\"\"> week</a> on Monday with Frank Lampard, under whom he excelled on loan at Derby last season, having decided he will play a role in the first-team in the campaign ahead. Mount managed 11 goals in 44 appearances at Derby with his performances in the second tier earning him a call-up into Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior England squad. If Lampard opts to play a 4-2-3-1, there would be scope for his inclusion in the trio behind the forward, harnessing his natural goalscoring ability and clever movement. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> <h2><strong>Crystal Palace</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tyrick Mitchell, 19, defender</strong></p> <p>The young left-back is one of seven academy and development squad players in the senior party competing at the Uhrencup in Switzerland. The 19-year-old, secured from Brentford towards the end of the 2015-16 campaign, has spent the last few seasons impressing in the under-18s and under-23s, signing a contract extension in January, and will aspire to emulate the achievements of Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka by breaking into the first team at Selhurst Park. Mitchell can put pressure on Patrick van Aanholt, the first-choice left\u2011back at the club, and caught the eye in the draw with Luzern with one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CPFC/status/1148897074882240518\" title=\"\">particularly finely timed challenge</a> which had his teammate Andros Townsend cooing on Twitter. \u201cNow where have I seen that tackle before?\u201d he wondered on the social media platform, with the similarities to Wan-Bissaka all too obvious. <strong>DF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Everton</strong></h2> <p><strong>Joe Williams, 22, midfielder</strong></p> <p>The Liverpool-born midfielder has already made a mark on pre-season with a goal in Everton\u2019s opening friendly against Kariobangi Sharks in Nairobi. He must continue to impress Marco Silva to finally breakthrough at the club he joined aged seven. Williams has spent the past two seasons on loan at Bolton and Barnsley and, having entered the final year of his contract, is attracting offers from the Bundesliga and Championship. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <h2><strong>Leicester</strong></h2> <p><strong>Khanya Leshabela, 19, midfielder</strong></p> <p>Leshabela, who has been at Leicester since 2013, has been training with Brendan Rodgers\u2019 first-team squad after spending the early part of the summer at the Under-20 World Cup with South Africa. Rodgers evidently sees the same high potential that persuaded Claude Puel to include the teenager in a Carabao Cup squad last December before the club awarded him a new contract in January. Strong and tricky on the ball and blessed with rapid pace and acceleration, he is savvy enough to play both centrally and out wide. He caught the eye on the wing against Scunthorpe in Leicester\u2019s first pre\u2011season outing. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <h2><strong>Liverpool</strong></h2> <p><strong>Bobby Duncan</strong><strong>, 18, striker</strong></p> <p>With Sadio Man\u00e9 still involved in the Africa Cup of Nations, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino only just beginning their holidays after international duty and Xherdan Shaqiri injured, Duncan will get his chance to impress on the upcoming US tour, alongside the highly-rated 19-year-old, Rhian Brewster. Duncan formed a prolific strike partnership with Paul Glatzel for the under-18s last season, scoring more than 60 goals in total including the equaliser against Manchester City in the FA Youth Cup final (Duncan) and the winning penalty in the shootout (Glatzel).

      "bodyText": "Arsenal Bukayo Saka, 17, winger Announced himself in style with a well-taken finish in the friendly win over Colorado Rapids this week and has been tipped to follow in the footsteps of Joe Willock, Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe, who have all been officially promoted to the first-team squad. Saka does not turn 18 until September but made his senior debut against Vorskla in the Europa League last season after starring for Freddie Ljungberg\u2019s under-23s. He has also been utilised as a full-back in the past, although his future looks likely to be further up the pitch. Ed Aarons Aston Villa Jack Clarke, 20, midfielder His namesake may have earned a \u00a310m move to Tottenham this summer but the boyhood Villa fan has been given a chance to impress by Dean Smith. Was scouted playing left-back by Jim Thomas, who also spotted Jack Grealish, as an under-nine. Has risen through the ranks with Callum O\u2019Hare, Andre Green and \u201cbest friend\u201d Jake Doyle-Hayes. Ben Fisher Bournemouth Mark Travers, 20, goalkeeper Outstanding on debut against Tottenham in May, 18 months on from a successful loan spell at Weymouth. The Republic of Ireland international has caught the eye of Mick McCarthy and is extremely highly regarded by Eddie Howe. Travers finished last season in between the sticks and could yet start this campaign as the first\u2011choice goalkeeper. Progress set to be rewarded with a long-term contract. BF Brighton Aaron Connolly, 19, striker Prolific at youth level, the Galway\u2011born forward is determined to make a first-team breakthrough under Graham Potter. Connolly, who joined Brighton as a scholar three years ago \u2013 shortly after a trial at Manchester United \u2013 was quickly fast-tracked into the under-23 side, for whom he scored 17 goals in 20 appearances last season. He finished last term on loan at Luton, making two appearances. BF Burnley Josh Benson, 19, midfielder Has yet to make a first-team appearance for Burnley but the midfielder has featured in the club\u2019s pre-season preparation in Portugal and could soon find himself named in matchday squads. While Sean Dyche will not be rushed, Benson is the same age as Dwight McNeil, who made his breakthrough last season and is now being linked with Juventus. Paul Wilson Chelsea Mason Mount, 20, midfielder Signed a new five-year contract worth around \u00a375,000 a week on Monday with Frank Lampard, under whom he excelled on loan at Derby last season, having decided he will play a role in the first-team in the campaign ahead. Mount managed 11 goals in 44 appearances at Derby with his performances in the second tier earning him a call-up into Gareth Southgate\u2019s senior England squad. If Lampard opts to play a 4-2-3-1, there would be scope for his inclusion in the trio behind the forward, harnessing his natural goalscoring ability and clever movement. Dominic Fifield Crystal Palace Tyrick Mitchell, 19, defender The young left-back is one of seven academy and development squad players in the senior party competing at the Uhrencup in Switzerland. The 19-year-old, secured from Brentford towards the end of the 2015-16 campaign, has spent the last few seasons impressing in the under-18s and under-23s, signing a contract extension in January, and will aspire to emulate the achievements of Aaron Wan\u2011Bissaka by breaking into the first team at Selhurst Park. Mitchell can put pressure on Patrick van Aanholt, the first-choice left\u2011back at the club, and caught the eye in the draw with Luzern with one particularly finely timed challenge which had his teammate Andros Townsend cooing on Twitter. \u201cNow where have I seen that tackle before?\u201d he wondered on the social media platform, with the similarities to Wan-Bissaka all too obvious. DF Everton Joe Williams, 22, midfielder The Liverpool-born midfielder has already made a mark on pre-season with a goal in Everton\u2019s opening friendly against Kariobangi Sharks in Nairobi. He must continue to impress Marco Silva to finally breakthrough at the club he joined aged seven. Williams has spent the past two seasons on loan at Bolton and Barnsley and, having entered the final year of his contract, is attracting offers from the Bundesliga and Championship. Andy Hunter Leicester Khanya Leshabela, 19, midfielder Leshabela, who has been at Leicester since 2013, has been training with Brendan Rodgers\u2019 first-team squad after spending the early part of the summer at the Under-20 World Cup with South Africa. Rodgers evidently sees the same high potential that persuaded Claude Puel to include the teenager in a Carabao Cup squad last December before the club awarded him a new contract in January. Strong and tricky on the ball and blessed with rapid pace and acceleration, he is savvy enough to play both centrally and out wide. He caught the eye on the wing against Scunthorpe in Leicester\u2019s first pre\u2011season outing. Paul Doyle Liverpool Bobby Duncan, 18, striker With Sadio Man\u00e9 still involved in the Africa Cup of Nations, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino only just beginning their holidays after international duty and Xherdan Shaqiri injured, Duncan will get his chance to impress on the upcoming US tour, alongside the highly-rated 19-year-old, Rhian Brewster. Duncan formed a prolific strike partnership with Paul Glatzel for the under-18s last season, scoring more than 60 goals in total including the equaliser against Manchester City in the FA Youth Cup final (Duncan) and the winning penalty in the shootout (Glatzel). Duncan won\u2019t be joined by his prolific strike partner, who picked up a knee injury in the friendly win over Tranmere. AH Manchester City Adri\u00e1n Bernab\u00e9, 18, midfielder The Spaniard has four minutes of first-team football \u2013 in last September\u2019s 3-0 EFL Cup win at Oxford United \u2013 and is another of Pep Guardiola\u2019s recruits from his former club Barcelona.

A forward who favours his left foot, Greenwood has made four appearances, including the final three minutes of the famous 3-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain in March. He scored against Leeds on Wednesday and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cHe will score goals this season.\u201d JJ Newcastle Matty Longstaff, 19, midfielder With his older brother Sean already turning heads away from St James\u2019 Park, there could well be another Longstaff making his name for his hometown club in the near future.

By then, annual sales of narcotic painkillers had surged past $8bn.</p> <p>US district judge Dan Polster, in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, is hearing about 2,000 civil cases brought by cities and counties coast-to-coast against opioid makers and distributors, wrapped into a giant case known as a multi-district litigation.</p> <p>He ordered the release of the data following a year-long legal battle by newspaper companies the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia, the state worst hit by the opioid epidemic, and the Washington Post.</p> <p>Deliveries of the two most common opioids, hydrocodone and oxycodone, escalated by more than 50% in the years covered by the database, to 12.6bn pills in 2012 alone, an analysis of the DEA numbers by the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/76-billion-opioid-pills-newly-released-federal-data-unmasks-the-epidemic/2019/07/16/5f29fd62-a73e-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html?utm_term=.77db6b9502aa\">found</a>.</p> <p>By then the federal agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had declared a public health crisis because of the surging death toll from overdoses. Some of the largest increases in sales were to parts of the country already devastated by opioids.</p> <p>Nearly nine out of 10 of the pills were manufactured by subsidiaries of three pharmaceutical multinationals \u2013 Mallinckrodt, Endo and Actavis, since renamed Allergan.</p> <p>These companies may not be household names but the pills they sold ardently, often allegedly inappropriately for treatment of chronic pain and while downplaying the risks of addiction, infiltrated communities all across the US in the last two decades.</p> <p>Mallinckrodt sold nearly 29bn opioids in the six years to 2012, taking 38% of the US market. Actavis was not far behind while Endo sold 11bn opioid tablets. Among Endo\u2019s drugs was a high-strength opioid, Opana, that it was forced to pull from the market because it was killing so many people.</p> <p>Meanwhile Purdue Pharma is alleged to have played a leading role in driving the mass prescribing that unleashed the epidemic by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/nov/08/the-making-of-an-opioid-epidemic\">changing</a> the practice and culture of pain treatment. It was the fourth-largest manufacturer but with a much smaller proportion of the market at about 3%.</p> <p>However, the volume of sales does not necessarily reflect the impact of individual drugs on the epidemic. Many of the more common painkillers were lower-strength opioids which helped create dependency and addiction but did not pose the same risk of overdose as stronger but less widely prescribed narcotics.</p> <p>Purdue sold $3bn of its high-strength branded drug, OxyContin, in 2010, about one-third of the opioid market by value at its peak.</p> <p>The pill consists of oxycodone, a powerful opioid derived from the opium poppy and which is stronger than morphine. The drug has been widely blamed for a surge in overdose deaths through the 2000s.</p> <p>All of the companies are targets of multiple lawsuits accusing them of driving up opioid sales with false claims about the safety and effectiveness of their drugs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/21/sackler-family-500-cities-counties-and-tribes-sue-oxycontin-maker\">as are</a> the members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma.</p> <p>The newly released DEA data will bolster the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that responsibility for the epidemic runs wide across the drug industry with manufacturers intent on grabbing as large a part of the opioid market as possible with little regard for the unfolding human tragedy.</p> <p>The opioid makers have denied wrongdoing and, among other things, sought to place blame for the epidemic on doctors overprescribing drugs. But Purdue has previously been hit with a $600m fine for a criminal conviction over its marketing of opioids, and in March the company agreed to pay $270m to settle a civil suit by the state of Oklahoma. Two years ago, Mallinckrodt paid a $35m settlement with the justice department over its opioid deliveries.</p> <p>County-by-county data shows that sales of opioids were often focused on areas most blighted by the epidemic, including some of the poorest parts of Appalachia. At one point, the highest per capita deliveries were to rural Mingo county, West Virginia, where \u201cpill mills\u201d and pharmacies were raking in money by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/28/opioid-addiction-west-virginia-lawsuit\">churning out</a> prescriptions without question to anyone who paid cash. The practice drew caravans of drug users from hundreds of miles away.</p> <p>Large numbers of the opioids delivered to Mingo county were by the country\u2019s biggest drug distributor, McKesson Corporation. The Washington Post said the DEA data showed that McKesson and five other companies, including the pharmaceutical chains Walgreens, CVS and Walmart, were responsible for the bulk of painkiller deliveries across the US.</p> <p>McKesson, which is <a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/\">listed</a> seventh in the Fortune 500 paid a record $150m fine two years ago to settle federal accusations that it was making suspiciously large deliveries of opioids to places where there could not be a legitimate demand for so many pills.</p> <p>It was also among companies that paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits by West Virginia\u2019s attorney general that they flooded his state with opioids.</p> <p>A former head of the DEA division responsible for monitoring prescription drug distribution, Joe Rannazzisi, has previously told the Guardian that he attempted to launch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/30/theyre-drug-dealers-in-armani-suits-executives-draw-focus-amid-us-epidemic\">criminal prosecutions</a> against McKesson and other distributors but he ran into the power of the industry\u2019s political lobbying and was blocked by justice department officials.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Drug makers and distributors flooded the US with more than 75bn opioid pills in the crucial years when the country\u2019s epidemic of painkiller addiction and deaths surged to record levels, according to previously secret data released by an American court. The publication of the Drug Enforcement Administration statistics is a blow to some of the country\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical firms that have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in out of court settlements in part to keep sealed evidence that they profiteered from escalating demand for opioids even as public health officials were declaring an epidemic. The database covers 2006 to 2012 when opioid prescriptions reached a peak of 282m a year, enough to supply every American adult with a month\u2019s worth of pills. By then, annual sales of narcotic painkillers had surged past $8bn. US district judge Dan Polster, in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, is hearing about 2,000 civil cases brought by cities and counties coast-to-coast against opioid makers and distributors, wrapped into a giant case known as a multi-district litigation. He ordered the release of the data following a year-long legal battle by newspaper companies the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia, the state worst hit by the opioid epidemic, and the Washington Post. Deliveries of the two most common opioids, hydrocodone and oxycodone, escalated by more than 50% in the years covered by the database, to 12.6bn pills in 2012 alone, an analysis of the DEA numbers by the Washington Post found. By then the federal agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had declared a public health crisis because of the surging death toll from overdoses. Some of the largest increases in sales were to parts of the country already devastated by opioids. Nearly nine out of 10 of the pills were manufactured by subsidiaries of three pharmaceutical multinationals \u2013 Mallinckrodt, Endo and Actavis, since renamed Allergan. These companies may not be household names but the pills they sold ardently, often allegedly inappropriately for treatment of chronic pain and while downplaying the risks of addiction, infiltrated communities all across the US in the last two decades. Mallinckrodt sold nearly 29bn opioids in the six years to 2012, taking 38% of the US market. Actavis was not far behind while Endo sold 11bn opioid tablets. Among Endo\u2019s drugs was a high-strength opioid, Opana, that it was forced to pull from the market because it was killing so many people. Meanwhile Purdue Pharma is alleged to have played a leading role in driving the mass prescribing that unleashed the epidemic by changing the practice and culture of pain treatment. It was the fourth-largest manufacturer but with a much smaller proportion of the market at about 3%. However, the volume of sales does not necessarily reflect the impact of individual drugs on the epidemic. Many of the more common painkillers were lower-strength opioids which helped create dependency and addiction but did not pose the same risk of overdose as stronger but less widely prescribed narcotics. Purdue sold $3bn of its high-strength branded drug, OxyContin, in 2010, about one-third of the opioid market by value at its peak. The pill consists of oxycodone, a powerful opioid derived from the opium poppy and which is stronger than morphine. The drug has been widely blamed for a surge in overdose deaths through the 2000s. All of the companies are targets of multiple lawsuits accusing them of driving up opioid sales with false claims about the safety and effectiveness of their drugs as are the members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma. The newly released DEA data will bolster the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that responsibility for the epidemic runs wide across the drug industry with manufacturers intent on grabbing as large a part of the opioid market as possible with little regard for the unfolding human tragedy. The opioid makers have denied wrongdoing and, among other things, sought to place blame for the epidemic on doctors overprescribing drugs. But Purdue has previously been hit with a $600m fine for a criminal conviction over its marketing of opioids, and in March the company agreed to pay $270m to settle a civil suit by the state of Oklahoma. Two years ago, Mallinckrodt paid a $35m settlement with the justice department over its opioid deliveries. County-by-county data shows that sales of opioids were often focused on areas most blighted by the epidemic, including some of the poorest parts of Appalachia. At one point, the highest per capita deliveries were to rural Mingo county, West Virginia, where \u201cpill mills\u201d and pharmacies were raking in money by churning out prescriptions without question to anyone who paid cash. The practice drew caravans of drug users from hundreds of miles away. Large numbers of the opioids delivered to Mingo county were by the country\u2019s biggest drug distributor, McKesson Corporation. The Washington Post said the DEA data showed that McKesson and five other companies, including the pharmaceutical chains Walgreens, CVS and Walmart, were responsible for the bulk of painkiller deliveries across the US. McKesson, which is listed seventh in the Fortune 500 paid a record $150m fine two years ago to settle federal accusations that it was making suspiciously large deliveries of opioids to places where there could not be a legitimate demand for so many pills. It was also among companies that paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits by West Virginia\u2019s attorney general that they flooded his state with opioids. A former head of the DEA division responsible for monitoring prescription drug distribution, Joe Rannazzisi, has previously told the Guardian that he attempted to launch criminal prosecutions against McKesson and other distributors but he ran into the power of the industry\u2019s political lobbying and was blocked by justice department officials.",

Responders in the field are facing intense violence along with deep community mistrust. They often can\u2019t get into the hot zone due to escalating violence and they can\u2019t find cases to vaccinate and treat because families are hiding the sick. There has been no clear strategy to break the vicious cycle of disease, violence and distrust.\u201d</p> <p>The status quo is no longer tenable, Gostin said. \u201cThe complacency in the international community, including the United States, is crippling the response.\u201d</p> <p>The British Red Cross, Mercy Corps and World Vision, all of which are working on the ground, said they hoped the declaration would lead to a significant scale-up in the response. \u201cA huge push and significant funding across the region are now required to contain this outbreak and bring it to an end. Otherwise, there is a real risk we will see a catastrophic spread of this deadly virus,\u201d said Sarah Clayton-Fisher of the British Red Cross.</p> <p>The possible arrival of the virus in Goma has long been feared by the agencies responding to the outbreak, because of its density and the movement of people through it to Rwanda.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/ebola-in-the-drc-everything-you-need-to-know\">Ebola in the DRC: everything you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRing\u201d vaccination of the contacts of those who fall ill and their contacts has not succeeded in limiting the spread of the virus. There is mistrust of the vaccine. Some people falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because it cannot protect anyone who is already infected when they have the shot. It is also very hard to track and trace the friends and relatives of the sick in areas where violent conflict is taking place.</p> <p>\u201cIf we cannot contain Ebola at the epicentre, we will continue to see cases spread to metropolitan areas and across borders,\u201d said Bob Kitchen, International Rescue Committee\u2019s vice-president for emergencies.</p> <p>\u201cThe inability to build community trust has proven a major barrier to stopping the spread of this disease.

      "bodyText": "The Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization has declared, calling for more funds and support to close it down. The second biggest Ebola outbreak ever, after the 2014-16 epidemic in west Africa, has reached a critical point with the diagnosis of a case in Goma, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. That follows the case last week of a women who crossed into Uganda to buy fish \u2013 and the arrival of a family harbouring the virus, three of whom died, in Uganda last month. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, appealed on Wednesday for the international community to help with funds. WHO is working on a new plan to control the epidemic, he said, which would cost \u201chundred of millions\u201d of dollars. \u201cIt is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cExtraordinary work has been done for almost a year under the most difficult circumstances. We all owe it to these responders \u2013 coming from not just WHO but also government, partners and communities \u2013 to shoulder more of the burden.\u201d He has made previous appeals for donors to provide the money they have promised. So far, only about half the pledges have come in. The WHO was not aware of any donor who has withheld funding because an emergency had not been declared, he said, \u201cbut if that was the excuse, it can no longer be used\u201d. Tedros appealed for countries not to seal their borders or close down travel to the DRC, arguing that it would only harm the attempts to end the epidemic. One year on from the start of the epidemic in North Kivu, there have been 2,512 cases of the disease and 676 deaths, most of which have been confirmed. This is the second biggest Ebola outbreak, after the west Africa epidemic, where 28,616 cases of disease and 11,310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016. The WHO is not only alarmed about the arrival of the virus in Uganda and on the Rwandan border, but also by the flare-up again in Beni. \u201cThe geographical expansion is now 500km,\u201d said Prof Robert Steffen, chair of the IHR emergency committee on Ebola in DRC, as he announced their advice to Tedros. The WHO\u2019s declaration was widely applauded by Ebola experts and the aid organisations struggling with the epidemic on the ground. \u201cThis is perhaps the most complicated epidemic the world has ever had to face, yet still the response in the DRC remains overstretched and underfunded,\u201d said Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at Wellcome. \u201cA step-up in the response, led by the DRC and with full international support, is critical if we are to bring the epidemic to an end. This must include enhanced diplomatic, public health, security and logistic efforts as well as releasing much needed financial resources.\u201d Larry Gostin, the director of the O\u2019Neill Institute in Washington DC and an expert on global health law, said the announcement gave the clearest possible signal that the WHO needs more financial and human resources. \u201cWithout a surge response, it will be impossible to bring the DRC Ebola epidemic under control.\u201d He called for bold action. \u201cStandard strategies like case identification, vaccination and treatment can\u2019t succeed in a complex humanitarian crisis like the situation in the DRC. Responders in the field are facing intense violence along with deep community mistrust. They often can\u2019t get into the hot zone due to escalating violence and they can\u2019t find cases to vaccinate and treat because families are hiding the sick. There has been no clear strategy to break the vicious cycle of disease, violence and distrust.\u201d The status quo is no longer tenable, Gostin said. \u201cThe complacency in the international community, including the United States, is crippling the response.\u201d The British Red Cross, Mercy Corps and World Vision, all of which are working on the ground, said they hoped the declaration would lead to a significant scale-up in the response. \u201cA huge push and significant funding across the region are now required to contain this outbreak and bring it to an end. Otherwise, there is a real risk we will see a catastrophic spread of this deadly virus,\u201d said Sarah Clayton-Fisher of the British Red Cross. The possible arrival of the virus in Goma has long been feared by the agencies responding to the outbreak, because of its density and the movement of people through it to Rwanda. \u201cRing\u201d vaccination of the contacts of those who fall ill and their contacts has not succeeded in limiting the spread of the virus. There is mistrust of the vaccine. Some people falsely believe that the vaccine is what is making people sick, in part because it cannot protect anyone who is already infected when they have the shot. It is also very hard to track and trace the friends and relatives of the sick in areas where violent conflict is taking place. \u201cIf we cannot contain Ebola at the epicentre, we will continue to see cases spread to metropolitan areas and across borders,\u201d said Bob Kitchen, International Rescue Committee\u2019s vice-president for emergencies. \u201cThe inability to build community trust has proven a major barrier to stopping the spread of this disease. Local communities are perplexed and frustrated by continued increase in the number of people dying juxtaposed with a massive influx of international organisations into the region during the past year.\u201d There have been four declarations of public health emergencies since 2005, when the WHO\u2019s new regulations were introduced: swine flu in 2009, polio in 2014, when there was a resurgence after near-eradication, Ebola in west Africa in 2014 and the Zika virus in Brazil in 2016.",

Being regarded as one of the worst ever prime ministers is something of a hollow crown, and for the past few weeks she has been visibly vanishing before our eyes. A flickering hologram at best. Now she enters rooms almost unnoticed, the embarrassing guest who has outstayed her welcome at a party that was over before it had even really begun. But still she rages against the dying of the light, determined to give one more speech to remind us all why she would so soon be completely forgotten.</p> <p>For her latest final valediction \u2013 no one can rule out further acts of self-destruction with final, final speeches \u2013 May had chosen a basement room of the international affairs thinktank Chatham House. She had also asked for five seats to be removed from the room, so that no sketch writers could witness her humiliation. Unfortunately no one had warned her it was to be televised. There\u2019s going to be hell to pay when she finds out, for what followed was \u2013 even by her own standards \u2013 a complete car crash.</p> <p>Here was a speech of such staggering lack of self-awareness that the prime minister could only have been auditioning for a post-Downing Street job as her own Maybot tribute act. A secondhand toy of such limited artificial intelligence, its code wasn\u2019t even written in binary. Just a babble of thoughts in noughts.

      "bodyText": "All that remains for Theresa May is her legacy. Such as it is. Being regarded as one of the worst ever prime ministers is something of a hollow crown, and for the past few weeks she has been visibly vanishing before our eyes. A flickering hologram at best. Now she enters rooms almost unnoticed, the embarrassing guest who has outstayed her welcome at a party that was over before it had even really begun. But still she rages against the dying of the light, determined to give one more speech to remind us all why she would so soon be completely forgotten. For her latest final valediction \u2013 no one can rule out further acts of self-destruction with final, final speeches \u2013 May had chosen a basement room of the international affairs thinktank Chatham House. She had also asked for five seats to be removed from the room, so that no sketch writers could witness her humiliation. Unfortunately no one had warned her it was to be televised. There\u2019s going to be hell to pay when she finds out, for what followed was \u2013 even by her own standards \u2013 a complete car crash. Here was a speech of such staggering lack of self-awareness that the prime minister could only have been auditioning for a post-Downing Street job as her own Maybot tribute act. A secondhand toy of such limited artificial intelligence, its code wasn\u2019t even written in binary. Just a babble of thoughts in noughts. She would have been more convincing if she had just remained silent for the entire 25 minutes. May began by taking us through some of the greatest hits of the last 30 years, pointing out that in many ways the world was a far better place now than it had ever been.

The chancellor expressed his horror after Rees-Mogg used a Daily Telegraph opinion piece to dismiss the \u201cpure silliness\u201d of Treasury forecasts suggesting a \u00a390bn hit to the economy. Rees-Mogg claimed there were economic models that showed \u201cthe total positive impact of no deal could be in the region of about \u00a380bn\u201d. Hammond hit back at the argument, saying on Twitter: \u201cHappy to debate scale of negative impact of no deal on the economy \u2013 but terrifying that someone this close to a potential future government can think we\u2019d actually be better off by adding barriers to access to our largest market.\u201d Rees-Mogg told the Guardian this was part of \u201cproject fear\u201d, which he claimed had been \u201cconsistently wrong\u201d, adding that his article made clear that the \u201cbarriers to trade that the chancellor is fretting about would be against World Trade Organization rules, while he ignores the benefits of future trade deals\u201d. The clash highlights the looming problems that Johnson is likely to have as prime minister if he wins the Tory leadership contest next week. The frontrunner has said he wants a deal with the EU that scraps the Northern Ireland backstop by the end of October, but if that fails, many of his Eurosceptic backers are keen to proceed to a no-deal Brexit. The Telegraph reported on Wednesday that Johnson has appointed the hardline Eurosceptic Daniel Moylan as a senior Brexit policy adviser. Moylan, who worked with Johnson early in his political career, has criticised the promise of \u201cno infrastructure\u201d at the Irish border after Brexit and argued Dublin should accept \u201ca minimally visible trade border\u201d. Hammond is one of many senior Tories on the other wing of the party who will fight hard against a no-deal outcome, with the chancellor even suggesting he could vote down his own government to stop it. Thursday\u2019s crunch Commons vote is set to expose those divisions in the House of Commons, which are likely to plague an incoming Johnson administration. On Wednesday, peers passed beefed-up protections against a new prime minister attempting to prorogue parliament to force an exit from the EU on 31 October. The amendment, which was backed by 13 rebel Tory peers, builds on an amendment to the bill passed in the Commons last week, to mandate fortnightly reports from the government on progress being made towards restoring the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline, theoretically making it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive has not been restored. Though it passed the House of Lords by a hefty majority of 103, the previous amendment by Dominic Grieve passed by just one vote \u2013 after a government whip forgot to vote. In her speech, May refused to criticise Johnson\u2019s approach directly, but suggest that refusal to shift from a rigid ideology was the cause of the UK\u2019s current predicament. Asked whether she would rule out that she was talking about Johnson or the US president Donald Trump, she called the remarks \u201ca general observation I have seen in politics across the world \u2026 I wanted to speak about it today as I think it is important to bring debate back into a more reasoned area so that people holding different views can have serious debate and discussion with each other.\u201d May said when she had brought her deal to parliament, MPs were already entrenched in their pre-referendum positions and railed against the coarsening of language in politics, highlighting that \u201cill words that go unchallenged are the first step on a continuum to ill deeds, towards a much darker place where hatred and prejudice drive not only what people say, but also what they do.\u201d \u201cSome are losing the ability to disagree without demeaning the views of others,\u201d she said, highlighting the abuse of female MPs in particular. \u201cThis descent of our debate into rancour and tribal bitterness, and in some cases even vile abuse at a criminal level, is corrosive to the democratic values which we should all be seeking to uphold.\u201d The departing prime minister also said she regretted making mistakes in her own language, particularly having referred to EU migrants as \u201cqueue-jumpers\u201d, when confronted over accusations that she had contributed to demonising language. Following her criticism of Trump for using racist language towards US congresswomen, May took aim at populism across the globe. \u201cThis absolutism is not confined to British politics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt festers in politics all across the world.

      "body": "<p>Elon Musk\u2019s secretive \u201cbrain-machine interface\u201d startup, Neuralink, stepped out of the shadows on Tuesday evening, revealing its progress in creating a wireless implantable device that can \u2013 theoretically \u2013 read your mind.</p> <p>At an event at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, Musk touted the startup\u2019s achievements since he founded it in 2017 with the goal of staving off what he considers to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo\">an \u201cexistential threat\u201d</a>: artificial intelligence (AI) surpassing human intelligence.</p> <p>Two years later, Neuralink claims to have achieved major advances toward Musk\u2019s goal of having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/01/elon-musk-neurotechnology-human-enhancement-brain-computer-interfaces\">human and machine intelligence</a> work in \u201csymbiosis\u201d. Neuralink says it has designed very small \u201cthreads\u201d \u2013 smaller than a human hair \u2013 that can be injected into the brain to detect the activity of neurons. It also says it has developed a robot to insert those threads in the brain, under the direction of a neurosurgeon.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is going to be important at a civilization-wide scale,\u201d Musk said at the event. \u201cEven under a benign AI, we will be left behind. With a high bandwidth brain-machine interface, we will have the option to go along for the ride.\u201d</p> <p>Musk\u2019s dread of AI notwithstanding, the near-term practical applications of implanting chips in brains are medical. As Neuralink president\u2019s, Max Hodak, pointed out at the event, scientists and doctors have worked for decades on devices or other means of directly interacting with the brain, from cochlear implants to deep brain stimulation treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease.</p> <p>The Neuralink device would be a significant improvement on the current state of the art, Musk claims, with 1,000 times more electrodes interfacing with the brain than the leading FDA-approved device used for Parkinson\u2019s patients.</p> <p>Neuralink plans to seek FDA approval for a human clinical trial as early as 2020, on a version of its device that is \u201conly intended for patients with serious unmet medical diseases\u201d, said Dr Matthew McDougall, Neuralink\u2019s head neurosurgeon. The first clinical trial will target patients with complete paralysis due to an upper spinal cord, and will involve installing four of Neuralink\u2019s implants in patients\u2019 brains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/01/san-francisco-big-tech-workers-industry\">'We all suffer': why San Francisco techies hate the city they transformed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the company has thus far only tested its devices on animals, a topic that Musk and Hodak acknowledged was a \u201csensitive\u201d issue. While it was previously known that Neuralink was testing its product on rats, Musk revealed during a question and answer session that the company is also working with scientists at the University of California, Davis, to conduct experiments with monkeys.</p> <p>\u201cWe definitely need to address the elephant in the room, the monkey in the room,\u201d Musk joked. \u201cA monkey has been able to control the computer with his brain. Just, FYI.\u201d</p> <p>After being lightly admonished by Hodak for revealing that information, which was not included in a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-17/elon-musk-s-neuralink-says-it-s-ready-to-begin-brain-surgery\">white paper</a> that Neuralink provided to some media outlets prior to the event, Musk responded: \u201cThe monkey is going to come out of the bag.\u201d</p> <p>The slow pace of achieving regulatory approval for a medical implant has not reined in the imaginations of Neuralink\u2019s staff, however. They foresee a future when having these devices implanted \u2013 a process that currently requires drilling small holes in the skull \u2013 will be as simple and low-risk as a Lasik procedure.</p> <p>Said Musk: \u201cThis has a very good purpose, which is to cure diseases, and ultimately secure humanity\u2019s future.\u201d</p>",

Two years later, Neuralink claims to have achieved major advances toward Musk\u2019s goal of having human and machine intelligence work in \u201csymbiosis\u201d. Neuralink says it has designed very small \u201cthreads\u201d \u2013 smaller than a human hair \u2013 that can be injected into the brain to detect the activity of neurons. It also says it has developed a robot to insert those threads in the brain, under the direction of a neurosurgeon. \u201cI think this is going to be important at a civilization-wide scale,\u201d Musk said at the event. \u201cEven under a benign AI, we will be left behind. With a high bandwidth brain-machine interface, we will have the option to go along for the ride.\u201d Musk\u2019s dread of AI notwithstanding, the near-term practical applications of implanting chips in brains are medical. As Neuralink president\u2019s, Max Hodak, pointed out at the event, scientists and doctors have worked for decades on devices or other means of directly interacting with the brain, from cochlear implants to deep brain stimulation treatments for Parkinson\u2019s disease. The Neuralink device would be a significant improvement on the current state of the art, Musk claims, with 1,000 times more electrodes interfacing with the brain than the leading FDA-approved device used for Parkinson\u2019s patients. Neuralink plans to seek FDA approval for a human clinical trial as early as 2020, on a version of its device that is \u201conly intended for patients with serious unmet medical diseases\u201d, said Dr Matthew McDougall, Neuralink\u2019s head neurosurgeon. The first clinical trial will target patients with complete paralysis due to an upper spinal cord, and will involve installing four of Neuralink\u2019s implants in patients\u2019 brains. But the company has thus far only tested its devices on animals, a topic that Musk and Hodak acknowledged was a \u201csensitive\u201d issue. While it was previously known that Neuralink was testing its product on rats, Musk revealed during a question and answer session that the company is also working with scientists at the University of California, Davis, to conduct experiments with monkeys. \u201cWe definitely need to address the elephant in the room, the monkey in the room,\u201d Musk joked. \u201cA monkey has been able to control the computer with his brain. Just, FYI.\u201d After being lightly admonished by Hodak for revealing that information, which was not included in a white paper that Neuralink provided to some media outlets prior to the event, Musk responded: \u201cThe monkey is going to come out of the bag.\u201d The slow pace of achieving regulatory approval for a medical implant has not reined in the imaginations of Neuralink\u2019s staff, however. They foresee a future when having these devices implanted \u2013 a process that currently requires drilling small holes in the skull \u2013 will be as simple and low-risk as a Lasik procedure. Said Musk: \u201cThis has a very good purpose, which is to cure diseases, and ultimately secure humanity\u2019s future.\u201d",

But as the latest household income and wealth data shows, the flow-on aspect to reduced government services will do just as much to increase inequality. Let\u2019s get a couple things out of the way straight off the bat. Cutting tax rates does not increase tax revenue. If you want to live in Laffer curve land idiocy, go off and apply for work at one of the assorted libertarian thinktanks for economic fantasy. The rest of us in the real world know lower tax rates equals lower tax revenue. Take the Trump company tax cuts \u2013 profits before tax have remained steady, even rising a bit in nominal terms, but company tax revenue? Utterly smashed, and not improving at all: The honest truth is the conservatives don\u2019t cut rates because they want to raise more tax; they cut them because they want to raise less tax. This isn\u2019t a secret, they say it out loud. They also like tax cuts that mostly favour the wealthy because they prefer to favour the wealthy in all things. Sure there might be a few conservatives who lie in bed hugging their Milton Friedman teddy bear below their life-sized portrait of Ronald Reagan, telling themselves that they are doing this because it is the best way to make life better for everyone. But come on. We know reality; let\u2019s not pretend otherwise. Thus it is clear that the government\u2019s tax cuts are set to both favour the wealthy and massively reduce revenue because they want them to. But the most recent survey on household income and wealth released last week showed that government income tax and spending on welfare are key drivers for reducing inequality, and equally important is the provision of government services. The income and wealth survey highlighted just how progressive is our tax and transfer system. Households in the lowest income quintile received on average $420 a week in cash benefits compared to $33 a week for those in the highest quintile, while the richest 25% pay on average $1,332 in tax compared to just $18 by the lowest: When we translate these amounts to a percentage of household disposable income, the bottom quintile gets 31% of their disposable income from cash benefits, compared to just 0.8% for those in the top 25%: But what is also vital to households\u2019 disposable income are things called \u201csocial transfers in kind\u201d. These are the dollar value for public services such as education, health and child care. These are more equally delivered across income groups because public education and health are open to all regardless of income. But they are very important for reducing inequality. Households in the lowest income quintile, for example, get $420 a week on average from cash benefits, and they also receive a total of $570 a week from social transfers. And this has a great impact on inequality. Households in the highest income quintile have 12.9 times the private income of those in the lowest quintile and 2.8 times those in the median quintile. After cash benefits this is reduced to 6.4 times and 2.4 times respectively. Income taxes alone only reduce it to 10.1 and 2.4, while social transfers in kind reduce it to 5.7 and 2.3: It means that while a lot of the focus for reducing inequality is on cash benefits, especially for increasing the income of the poorest, for households in the second, median and fourth quintiles the big items are the progressive nature of income tax and social security transfers in kind. The ratio of the income of the highest quintile to the median quintile is reduced by the same amount by income tax paid as it is from receiving social transfers in kind: It is worth noting that all households on average pay $437 a week in tax on income and receive $477 a week from social transfers in kind \u2013 reduce one and it is clear so too must you reduce the other. And what is the government\u2019s tax plan? It is to lower the progressivity of income tax while at the same time lowering the overall tax raise. And as the Grattan Institute noted, the government forecast that this will occur in a budgetary space that sees a surplus exceeding 1% of GDP by 2026-27. The only way that can be done is (as the budget papers show) by government expenditure falling steadily over the next decade to 23.6% of GDP in 2029-30 from the level of 24.9% in 2018-19. The last time payments were that low was at the height of the mining boom when unemployment was below 5% and 12.3% of our population was over the age of 65 compared to 14.6% now. That is important because retirees are those who are mostly dependent upon both cash benefits and social transfers. As the Grattan Institute noted, \u201cthe Parliamentary Budget Office says ageing will add 0.3% of GDP a year to spending by 2028-29\u201d: So the ageing population is adding to the need for government spending at a time the government is cutting taxes and saying it will reduce overall government expenditure. The only way this and a surplus can be achieved is through massive cuts in spending that does not affect retirees directly. That means cuts to spending on education, health care for non-retirees, and also reductions in non-aged pension cash benefits. It will make for a very different Australia \u2013 one much less equal, and one where people will be expected to pay for services they currently take for granted will be provided by the public. And don\u2019t think that this is just an unfortunate consequence.

      "bodyText": "Large energy users would be paid to reduce their power demand at peak times under a proposed new rule for the sector aimed at boosting competition and reducing wholesale prices. The Australian Energy Market Commission will release its draft rule for a demand-response mechanism on Thursday, which will allow large commercial and industrial users to sell forsaken demand directly into the wholesale market for the first time. But the draft ruling, which is aimed at taking pressure off the power system in times of peak demand, is not scheduled to come into effect until July 2022 and will initially preclude households and small businesses from the scheme. Under the new rule, the Australian Energy Market Operator will be able to bypass retailers and pay large energy users to cut their power use via a third-party service provider. The measure, which will put the so-called \u201cdemand response\u201d on an equal footing to generation for the first time, will see energy users paid as if they are generators. It is expected to put downward pressure on wholesale prices, lower emissions and prevent blackouts. Demand response has long been advocated by consumer and energy groups as a way to improve the operation of the energy market, and was a key element of chief scientist Alan Finkel\u2019s proposed remedy for the Australian energy market, centred on the now abandoned national energy guarantee. The ACCC\u2019s Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry report, released in June 2018, also strongly recommended demand response measures. The AEMC\u2019s draft ruling, which will now be subject to an eight-week consultation period, came about after the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the Australia Institute and Total Environment Centre applied for a rule change, along with a separate request from the South Australian government. The AEMC chairman, John Pierce, said the changes, which are slated to begin on 1 July 2022, when the Liddell coal-fired power station is due to retire, would push more expensive electricity generation \u2013 such as that produced by so-called peaking plants \u2013 to the back of the queue. \u201cThis draft rule is all about large commercial and industrial consumers in the wholesale market who can now participate directly in the wholesale market by offering in demand reductions,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cThese are times in which those consumers have agreed not to consume electricity or consume less or later. \u201cTaking demand pressure off the power system is a substitute for generation and helps tackle rising wholesale prices at peak times reducing electricity costs for everyone. \u201cMost simply, demand response is a consumer choice to turn down or turn off their electricity use in response to a signal to do so. So if wholesale prices are higher, there is more incentive for demand response. It makes sense to manage demand for electricity if we are going to deliver reliable energy at the least possible cost.\u201d The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission chairman, Rod Sims, said the mechanism would make it \u201ceasier and more attractive\u201d for big energy users to reduce their demand on the power system. \u201cThis is a vital development in the reform of the national electricity market, and will help to bring electricity prices down,\u201d Sims said. \u201cA demand response measure allows the electricity system to be more efficient, limiting the need for additional generation and, importantly, constraining the power of generation businesses, both leading to lower prices for consumers. \u201cWe will be closely examining the detail of the draft determination and are looking forward to seeing it come to fruition.\u201d The three groups who lodged the request for a rule change in August 2018 said the allowance of a new category of energy market participant \u2013 a demand response service provider \u2013 would allow consumers to freely compete against generators in the National Energy Market. The Australia Institute\u2019s Dan Cass said the three biggest electricity markets in the world \u2013 China, America and the EU \u2013 were pursuing similar reforms and Australia needed to \u201ckeep up\u201d. \u201cAustralia has a peak demand problem that means households, businesses and farms are paying too much for electricity,\u201d Cass said. \u201cHigh peaks during heatwaves put reliability at risk and the AEMC has recognised that demand response is a smart, efficient solution.\u201d Mark Byrne of the Total Environment Centre said the \u201conly losers\u201d from the reform were the energy companies \u201cthat want to dominate the generation and retail markets and keep prices high.\u201d The AEMC rule will not allow households and small business users to take par but the AEMC\u2019s executive general manager, security and reliability, Suzanne Falvi, told Guardian Australia that given the scheme was not due to come into effect until 2022, there was time to refine protections that could see them included in the scheme by that time. \u201cBefore we open it up to households and small businesses, we need to be sure that they have got the right protections in place,\u201d she said. She said that while there had long been advocacy for demand response, technology was only now at a point where doing so was feasible. \u201cTechnology has evolved to the point where now is probably the right time to be doing this,\u201d Falvi said. \u201cIn order to to be able to do demand response well you need to be able to have the technology to be able to control your consumption.\u201d",

A new study, released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) on Thursday, found the declining number of publicly owned homes was offset by a 55,470 increase in homes run by non-profit providers. Although overall social housing, which includes government and non-profit run stock, increased by about 27,401 \u2013 or about 6% \u2013 over the 10 years to 2017-18, the study found the increase had \u201cnot kept pace with the growth in households\u201d. That meant about a quarter of new public housing tenants in 2017-18 who were classified as in \u201cgreatest need\u201d had been on the waiting list longer than 12 months, with 13% waiting longer than two years to be housed. The Australian Council of Social Service\u2019s Peter Davidson said the report confirmed that governments were \u201cunder-investing in public and community housing\u201d, while the Homelessness Australia chair, Jenny Smith, called on the commonwealth \u201cto turn the dial on decline in social housing\u201d. The report pointed to a \u201cconsiderable change in provision of social housing\u201d resulting from a \u201cgradual but steady policy focus\u201d on \u201cgrowing the community housing sector and transferring ownership\u201d. It comes as public housing advocates have decried moves from state governments to sell public housing land to developers. The states argue the extra revenue allows them to boost social housing elsewhere, mostly through non-profit providers, but critics say the reduction in publicly owned homes will have consequences. Mark Feenane, the executive officer of the Victorian Public Tenants Association, said community housing providers did not face the same obligations as public housing authorities, meaning leases were more insecure. \u201cAdditionally, community housing providers are not obliged to fill all new vacancies from the waitlist which leads to an effective shrinkage in stock over time,\u201d Feenane said. The long wait for a home The AIHW report said there were 140,600 applicants on the waiting list for public housing in Australia in June 2018, down from 154,600 in June 2014. But 45,800 were considered in \u201cgreatest need\u201d because they were homeless, their safety was at risk or they had very high rental costs. That was an increase of 2,600 among the most vulnerable. About 4,100 \u2013 or a quarter \u2013 of all new \u201cgreatest need\u201d tenants had been waiting longer than 12 months for a home. It\u2019s a familiar situation for Adelaide woman Wendy Morgan, who found herself living in her car in 2013 after she was retrenched at work and could no longer pay her rent. When Morgan found herself facing an ongoing eviction battle again in late 2015, she contacted South Australia\u2019s public housing authority asking for a home. Only last December, it finally happened. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get that house when I did, I was within days of living in my car again,\u201d Morgan, 57, told Guardian Australia. She said it had only been when was facing imminent homelessness that her application appeared to progress. Morgan, who is a member of the Anti-Poverty Network, said her public housing unit was small, and that she felt \u201clike a hoarder\u201d fitting her belongings in there. But it had also helped her get her life back on track. \u201cThe stability of this house has given me the opportunity to get some part-time work, which has improved my situation a bit,\u201d she said. The report also found about 4% of tenants in public and community housing units were living in overcrowded dwellings, while about 7,300 social housing units were currently considered \u201cuntenantable\u201d. Of the 20,400 new public housing tenants in 2017-18, 35% were homeless at the time, while 27% were at risk of homelessness.",

I really am crazy!</p> <p>But midway through writing Fake I came to understand something: my three essays were actually one, separated only in time. They form a continuum. They tell the story of how one woman\u2019s life has unfolded at a point in the 21st century. Mine has not been an uncommon trajectory.</p> <p>In my 20s and 30s, I spent too long in relationships that were doomed to fail (who hasn\u2019t?). I travelled for work. I lived in multiple cities as I built my career \u2013 Brisbane (twice), London, Melbourne (twice), Hong Kong. In each city, I knew no one and battled loneliness as I built social circles. It was years before I realised how detrimental that transience had been to the growth of substantial and stable relationships, to the sense of belonging in a community, to the chance to meet a man with whom I could establish a family before it was too late.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/13/i-needed-to-deal-with-my-destructive-demons-before-i-could-write-about-my-past\">I needed to deal with my destructive demons before I could write about my past | Vicki Laveau-Harvie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the time I landed in Sydney I had not met a partner. I had just turned 40. By then, most of my contemporaries were busy with young families. My childhood friends, my school friends, my university friends, my first-job friends were all in other cities. Establishing new networks at that stage in your life as a single woman is a challenge. Sydney is a transient city. Friends I have made since I arrived have moved elsewhere.</p> <p>And to meet a partner? The statistics are grim for women who have hit 40. No woman in the western world doubts the existence of a demographic black hole: there is barely an available heterosexual man over the age of 30, never mind an available decent man.</p> <p>I had been single and lonely on and off for years when this unsavoury character contacted me on a dating website.

I threw thoughts and quotes into it as I came upon them. Writers, of course, provided the greatest wisdom. I loved what Ana\u00efs Nin had to say: \u201cSomething is always born of excess: great art was born of great terrors, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities.\u201d And I found solace in the words of Jorge Luis Borges: \u201cAll that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art.\u201d</p> <p>But Oprah Winfrey encapsulated everything for me, and more succinctly: \u201cSpeaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have.\u201d I may not have written my last personal essay.

I had not lost money \u2013 he never asked for it \u2013 but I had lost my trust in myself and the world. The Good Weekend article \u2013 again a cover story, \u201cLove lies bleeding\u201d \u2013 did not include expert voices, research or other people\u2019s stories. It was my story alone. It became a sensation. For weeks after publication I was assailed with messages from readers. Many told me their own devastating stories of relationships with such characters. That third essay became my book, Fake. I have joked with friends about my tragic trifecta of essays. Get the violins out, I say. Look: a lonely childless woman who fell for a con artist. Look at the label I\u2019ve affixed to myself. I really am crazy! But midway through writing Fake I came to understand something: my three essays were actually one, separated only in time. They form a continuum. They tell the story of how one woman\u2019s life has unfolded at a point in the 21st century. Mine has not been an uncommon trajectory. In my 20s and 30s, I spent too long in relationships that were doomed to fail (who hasn\u2019t?). I travelled for work. I lived in multiple cities as I built my career \u2013 Brisbane (twice), London, Melbourne (twice), Hong Kong. In each city, I knew no one and battled loneliness as I built social circles. It was years before I realised how detrimental that transience had been to the growth of substantial and stable relationships, to the sense of belonging in a community, to the chance to meet a man with whom I could establish a family before it was too late. By the time I landed in Sydney I had not met a partner. I had just turned 40. By then, most of my contemporaries were busy with young families. My childhood friends, my school friends, my university friends, my first-job friends were all in other cities. Establishing new networks at that stage in your life as a single woman is a challenge. Sydney is a transient city. Friends I have made since I arrived have moved elsewhere. And to meet a partner? The statistics are grim for women who have hit 40. No woman in the western world doubts the existence of a demographic black hole: there is barely an available heterosexual man over the age of 30, never mind an available decent man. I had been single and lonely on and off for years when this unsavoury character contacted me on a dating website. Is it any surprise I should have been more vulnerable to his manipulations, to stick with him for longer than sensible? I see now that my three essays have been one story told in chapters. The label \u201clonely childless woman who fell for a con artist\u201d may be factually correct but texturally, not so. It does not tell the truth of my story at all. I am anything but a poor damaged soul. My story is not one of failure. I have a rich and interesting life. I have work that I adore. I have dear friends, although too many in other cities. As I wrote Fake, all the while grappling with the sanity, or insanity, of exposing myself again and on a grander scale, I started a document I titled \u201cWhy Do This\u201d. I threw thoughts and quotes into it as I came upon them. Writers, of course, provided the greatest wisdom. I loved what Ana\u00efs Nin had to say: \u201cSomething is always born of excess: great art was born of great terrors, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities.\u201d And I found solace in the words of Jorge Luis Borges: \u201cAll that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art.\u201d But Oprah Winfrey encapsulated everything for me, and more succinctly: \u201cSpeaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have.\u201d I may not have written my last personal essay. There is much more to be said. \u2022 Stephanie Wood is a journalist and the author of Fake, available now through Vintage (PRH)",

      "bodyText": "A no-deal showdown is expected in the House of Commons on Thursday after peers passed stronger protections against the prospect of a Boris Johnson administration attempting to prorogue parliament to force an exit from the EU in October. The House of Lords passed an amendment by a majority of 103 on Wednesday that would ensure parliament would sit in the weeks leading up to the 31 October deadline. Fears have been growing that Johnson could prorogue or dissolve parliament in order to allow the deadline to pass without MPs interfering. Thirteen Tory peers rebelled against the government to vote for the amendment from the crossbench peer David Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terror legislation, with support from Labour and the Lib Dems. The amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill builds on an amendment passed in the Commons last week, when MPs backed a proposal from the pro-European Tory Dominic Grieve calling for fortnightly reports from the government on the efforts to restore the power-sharing executive. The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline. The bill could theoretically make it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland has not been restored.

The FCA\u2019s enforcement team was warned three years ago about the company, but failed to act.</p> <p>One victim claimed FCA staff assured her that dealings with LC&amp;F were protected by the regulator. But complex regulation meant that while LC&amp;F was authorised by the regulator, the mini-bond products it sold were not. It left investors unable to recover their cash through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme once the firm went under.</p> <p>One attendee challenged the FCA to be more proactive in training staff and explaining which products and services are protected \u2013 referred to as the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d.</p> <p>But the FCA\u2019s chairman, Charles Randell, said that rules governing the regulatory perimeter are hard to understand, given how much they have changed over time. \u201cIt\u2019s actually almost impossible to explain.

      "bodyText": "The City watchdog has admitted that its rules are so complex that even its staff may not understand which investment products come under its jurisdiction. The chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority made the concession during a tempestuous annual public meeting in London on Wednesday, where consumers criticised the regulator for failing to protect them from a growing list of scandals. Attendees demanded answers over the collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance, which is now at the centre of a mounting \u00a3236m financial scandal in which more than 11,000 investors lost money. The FCA\u2019s enforcement team was warned three years ago about the company, but failed to act. One victim claimed FCA staff assured her that dealings with LC&amp;F were protected by the regulator. But complex regulation meant that while LC&amp;F was authorised by the regulator, the mini-bond products it sold were not. It left investors unable to recover their cash through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme once the firm went under. One attendee challenged the FCA to be more proactive in training staff and explaining which products and services are protected \u2013 referred to as the \u201cregulatory perimeter\u201d. But the FCA\u2019s chairman, Charles Randell, said that rules governing the regulatory perimeter are hard to understand, given how much they have changed over time. \u201cIt\u2019s actually almost impossible to explain. There\u2019s tremendous risk of confusion, either on the part of consumers, or \u2026 on the part of our staff. So it\u2019s not a good situation and I\u2019ll be the first to acknowledge that,\u201d he added. \u201cFor many people in this country \u2026 unregulated investment, particularly high-risk investments, have absolutely no place in their savings and retirement planning. They\u2019re not suitable products for people, and they should go in to those products with their eyes much wider open than the perimeter enables them to be at the moment.\u201d Randell and the FCA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, were also questioned over compensation for overcharged HSBC credit card customers, allegations of misconduct at Lloyds Bank\u2019s business support unit in Bristol, and its lack of action around Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s now-defunct Global Restructuring Group [GRG]. Some of the nearly 350 people present turned angry when the FCA failed to extend the meeting, which lasted two hours, inciting a shout of \u201cyou\u2019re running away\u201d from one. Last month the FCA confirmed it would not punish either RBS or any current or former RBS managers, despite finding evidence of \u201csystemic and widespread\u201d mistreatment of small and medium-sized business customers between 2008 and 2013. The regulator said its powers were limited as business lending is not regulated in the UK. When asked what would constitute \u201ccriminal behaviour\u201d in the GRG case, Bailey said the FCA introduced the senior managers\u2019 regime in 2016, which aims to hold individuals at the bank responsible when things go wrong. He stopped short of confirming whether any crimes would have been committed under the new rules, and stressed that the regulation could not applied retroactively.",

Should the Labour leadership move closer to a pro-EU approach, the pound may reach $1.35.\u201d Sterling has already lost 1% against the euro this month and more than 2% against the dollar, putting it on track for its biggest monthly drop since June 2018. With the pound already the worst-performing major currency against the dollar this year, Morgan Stanley were not alone in predicting further falls. HSBC strategists said a no-deal outcome would push the pound all the way to $1.10, while Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon raised the prospect of it hitting the post EU-referendum low of $1.15 reached briefly during the flash crash of October 2016. \u201cClearly the issues facing the UK currently have not been faced in the last decade or so, even during the global financial crisis, and the potential for the pound to hit the 2016 lows is there,\u201d Mellor said. Sterling\u2019s weakness in the currency markets has been exacerbated by the strength of the dollar, which Donald Trump has said puts US exporters at a disadvantage. In a finding likely to be seized upon by the US president, the International Monetary Fund said the US currency was 6-12% too high while the euro was 18% undervalued for Germany. The IMF\u2019s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said Germany was running an excessive current account deficit.",

      "bodyText": "The Dutch airline KLM is facing a storm of protest after warning that women who breastfeed their babies on its flights may be asked to cover up to avoid offending other passengers. The company\u2019s policy emerged after a woman claimed on Facebook she had been asked to shield herself from view while feeding her one-year-old on a flight between San Francisco and Amsterdam last month. Shelby Angel, from Sacramento in California, said a flight attendant had approached her with a blanket, which she refused, saying she felt \u201cuncomfortable and disrespected\u201d. Angel said she always sought to be discreet but that her daughter did not like to be covered. After complaining to KLM she was told it was the airline\u2019s official policy and that passengers needed to be \u201crespectful of people of other cultures\u201d. A KLM Twitter account later tweeted in response to the criticism prompted by the woman\u2019s Facebook post, confirming that \u201cto ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this\u201d. It added: \u201cAs an international airline company, we transport passengers with a variety of backgrounds. Not all passengers feel comfortable with breastfeeding in their vicinity and sometimes these passengers complain to the cabin staff.\u201d The response has led to other airlines being asked on social media to explain their stance. British Airways said it did not have an official policy but that passengers who required privacy should \u201cplease speak with one of the crew when you are board\u201d. KLM, which recently sought to burnish its credentials as an environmentally conscious airline by encouraging passengers to take fewer flights, has been accused of stigmatising mothers. Niki Kandirikirira, from the Equality Now lobby group, said: \u201cNegative attitudes about breastfeeding in public stem from the over-sexualisation of women\u2019s bodies. Breastfeeding is a totally natural process and women should have the freedom to do it wherever and whenever they want, rather than being forced to hide as if they are doing something inappropriate.\u201d Physicians and health campaigners have expressed their frustration on social media at the \u201cantiquated\u201d policy of the airline. One doctor tweeted: \u201cI find it uncomfortable and offensive when people chew with their mouths open, infinitely more so than breastfeeding. Can you cover up the heads of passengers who do so with a blanket? Thanks!\u201d The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for their first six months, then have a diet of breast milk and other food until they are two years old or beyond. The NHS advises new mothers that breastfeeding reduces a baby\u2019s risk of infection, diarrhoea and vomiting, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood leukaemia, obesity and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Ayala Ochert, from the campaign group Better Breastfeeding, said: \u201cIn their effort to avoid offence in the tiny minority of people disturbed by the sight of a child feeding, KLM has instead chosen to offend a mother trying to feed and nurture her child.\u201d The chief executive of the Breastfeeding Network, Shereen Fisher, added: \u201cCompanies and employers should be taking a lead on supporting and protecting breastfeeding. \u201cThe recent poor treatment of a KLM customer who happened to also be a breastfeeding mother is another disappointing example of how treating people badly is not only bad for business but perpetuates a myth that breastfeeding in a public space is likely to invite controversy. \u201cMany mothers tell us they already feel isolated and embarrassed when breastfeeding, despite the irony of most of us being surrounded by images of nudity from a young age. \u201cEmployers and providers of services can play an important role in putting women and their families at ease by supporting breastfeeding, which is a normal feeding practice across all societies and cultures.

They still suggest that the most likely outcome is that the UK has not left at all. And for all the talk of no deal, they give it a chance of only one in three.</p> <p>Therefore, sterling could still fall a lot further in the event of no deal, as this outcome is far from being fully discounted. In fact, they are assigning it about the same probability as they did a vote to leave the EU in the original referendum \u2013 something which came as a huge shock when it actually happened.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Meanwhile, even if a deal is reached, we doubt that sterling would do very well this year. This is because we expect appetite for risk to wane across the globe as the world economy slows, prompting the dollar to strengthen against most currencies, including sterling. </p> <p>The upshot is that, in our view, the near-term risks for the currency are still skewed to the downside. But there is a chance that the pound will rebound in 2020 or 2021, if inflation rises and the BoE tightens monetary policy as a result</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div

Looking ahead to the rest of the summer, Pound risk is surely to the downside.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2ed6a88f08d0b6ca53223d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-17T08:11:03.051Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fec9dc4c0eaa1b9c587cce33cc84f53f7a1a49b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fec9dc4c0eaa1b9c587cce33cc84f53f7a1a49b/0_0_5079_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Turgutreis Beach in Bodrum Turkey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turgutreis Beach in Bodrum Turkey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>UK holidaymakers heading abroad this summer will feel the impact of the pound\u2019s slide.</strong> Sterling will buy less at the foreign exchange desk, so hotels, meals and ice-creams on the beach will all cost more.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-17/brexit-bulletin-the-pound-pays-the-price?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=brexit&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-facebook-brexit&amp;utm_source=twitter\">As Bloomberg puts it</a>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The currency is down 4% against the euro, 5% against the dollar and 6% against the Turkish lira since mid-April.

      "bodyText": "Talk of an early general election has also hurt the pound. Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said: \u201cElection talk is why the pound is underperforming again, not much of a surprise to hear given the working majority is close to no majority at all. Hence why suspending parliament talk is in the air still. It\u2019s hard to see any possible positive news for the rest of this week to stop the current trend.\u201d Capital Economics also predict further losses for the pound, pushing it towards dollar parity. Analyst Hubert de Barochez points to Brexit worries, and recent weak economic data. He told clients today: As far as the outlook for Brexit is concerned, bookmakers\u2019 odds indicate that investors have now all but ruled out the possibility that the UK leaves the EU with a deal before the end of 2019. They still suggest that the most likely outcome is that the UK has not left at all. And for all the talk of no deal, they give it a chance of only one in three. Therefore, sterling could still fall a lot further in the event of no deal, as this outcome is far from being fully discounted. In fact, they are assigning it about the same probability as they did a vote to leave the EU in the original referendum \u2013 something which came as a huge shock when it actually happened. Meanwhile, even if a deal is reached, we doubt that sterling would do very well this year. This is because we expect appetite for risk to wane across the globe as the world economy slows, prompting the dollar to strengthen against most currencies, including sterling. The upshot is that, in our view, the near-term risks for the currency are still skewed to the downside. But there is a chance that the pound will rebound in 2020 or 2021, if inflation rises and the BoE tightens monetary policy as a result Time for a quick recap Analysts have warned that the pound could slump towards parity against the US dollar, if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal. Morgan Stanley warned: The pound has come under intense selling pressure since Prime Minister May withdrew from her party leadership position, leaving markets with increased concern that the U.K. may be heading towards a harder Brexit. Should this scenario materialize, pound-dollar could fall into the $1.00-$1.10 range.\u201d The pound hit a fresh 27-month low against the dollar this morning, amid growing fears that Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt could trigger a disorderly Brexit. Sterling hit $1.2382 for the first time since March 2017, and also scraped a six-month low against the euro at \u20ac1.1075. The IMF has warned, meanwhile, that the US dollar is already overvalued, while Germany is benefitting from an unduly-weak euro. UK house prices continue to be hurt by Brexit uncertainty. In London, they plunged by 4.4% year-on-year in May, the worst decline since the financial crisis. Across the country, growth slowed to 1.2%. Consumer price inflation stuck at 2% in June, hitting the Bank of England\u2019s target for the second month running. The pound is struggling back from this morning\u2019s 27-month low, to around $1.243 to the US dollar.... but there could be worse to come. US investment bank Morgan Stanley has warned that sterling could slump to parity against the US dollar if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal. That would be a record low, even worst than the $1.05 level plumbed in 1985 during the Thatcher-era sterling crisis. In a research note published today, Morgan Stanley warn: \u201cThe pound has come under intense selling pressure since Prime Minister May withdrew from her party leadership position, leaving markets with increased concern that the U.K. may be heading towards a harder Brexit. Should this scenario materialize, pound-dollar could fall into the $1.00-$1.10 range.\u201d The IMF is also concerned by the gap between countries who run a trade surplus, and those who run a deficit. Gita Gopinath, head of the Fund\u2019s research department, says politicians need to do more to improve their fiscal position while also boosting growth: Many countries are now near full employment and have limited room to maneuver in their public budgets. So, governments need to carefully calibrate their policies to achieve domestic and external objectives. Countries with excess current account deficits, like the United Kingdom and the United States, should adopt or continue with growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, while those with excess current account surpluses, like Germany and Korea, should use fiscal space to boost public infrastructure investment and potential growth. The International Monetary Fund has declared that the US dollar is overvalued, a development that may cheer Donald Trump. In a new report, the IMF estimates that the dollar\u2019s effective exchange rate is between 6% and 12% too high, based on economic fundamentals. Conversely, it believes that the euro is up to 18% undervalued for Germany, but up to 4% too valuable for France. The Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, the Fund adds, are trading at levels that are \u201cwarranted\u201d by economic fundamentals. Trump has long complained that other countries are taking advantage of America by devaluing their currencies, often singling out the yuan and the euro. Today\u2019s report may bolster his argument that the US Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to push the dollar down. The IMF\u2019s new External Sector Report also warned that Brexit, and the US-China trade war, could threaten the global economy. \u201cAn intensification of trade tensions or a disorderly Brexit outcome - with further repercussions for global growth and risk aversion - could .... affect other economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand and external financing.\u201d Many economists and commentators are alarmed by the slowdown in America\u2019s building sector. Here\u2019s some early reaction: America\u2019s housing market is also slowing. The number of permits granted to build a new home plunged by 6.1% in June, new government data shows. It hit an annual rate of just 1.22 million units, the lowest since May 2017. That suggests a drop in demand, or that builders are nervous about taking on new projects. The number of actual housing starts also slowed, down 0.9% to an annual rate of 1.253 million, according to the Commerce Department. America\u2019s housing market has looked lacklustre for several months -- this may bolster the case for US interest rate cuts. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has faced the wrath of UK citizens who have lost money from various scandals. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, received a rough ride at the FCA\u2019s annual meeting. He was challenged over Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s Global Restructuring Group (which drove small firms into bankruptcy) and the London Capital &amp; Finance scandal (which collapsed owing money to cost thousands of customers). Attendees at today\u2019s meeting blasted the FCA for not doing a better job -- some even accused its top managers of being \u201ccrooks\u201d who belonged in jail. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports: Paul Smith, chief executive of Haart estate agents, agrees that London house prices have further to fall: \u201cThe Tory leadership battle is soon to come to a head. Whilst Boris\u2019 proposals to cut stamp duty are attractive, the constant uncertainty and political instability is impacting property markets across the UK, with price growth slowing to just 1.2% this month. This reduction is largely being driven by price falls in London which tends to feel the impact of political unrest more acutely than other regions of the UK. As we edge ever closer towards the October 31st deadline, and indeed the prospect of a potential no deal scenario, we can perhaps expect a further decline to London house prices over coming months, but thereafter more positive headlines.\u201d More expensive London houses have suffered the biggest price hit. The price of a detached home has slumped by 6% in the last 12 months, while terraced homes are only 2.9% cheaper. London\u2019s Evening Standard newspaper is splashing on the capital\u2019s house price slump: Ironically, the Standard\u2019s editor played a role in London\u2019s house price boom. When he was chancellor, George Osborne introduced the Help To Buy scheme that helped people borrow more money for a house. This drove prices higher - boosting housebuilders\u2019 profits rather than making property affordable. This is a neat way of showing how the UK housing market has cooled (green = strong growth, while red = weak) Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on the house price slowdown: House prices in London have fallen at their fastest pace since the financial crash a decade ago as the capital bears the brunt of the nationwide torpor in the property market. Amid a dearth of potential buyers, the cost of a home in London was 4.4% lower in May than a year earlier, according to the latest official snapshot of the market from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said it was the biggest drop in London prices since the 7.0% annual fall recorded in August 2009 \u2013 a period that included the near-meltdown of the global banking system in the autumn of 2008.... More here: With Britain just three months away from a possible no-deal Brexit, you need strong nerves to consider signing up for a large mortgage. Paul Stockwell, Chief Commercial Officer of Gatehouse Bank (a Sharia-compliant challenger bank) says economic uncertainty is keeping potential buyers out of the market: \u201cFalling house prices in London have become the norm, but the small annual decline in the North East points to low transaction volumes having an impact on the market across England. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time prices fell in the North East this year, they also took a small dent back in February and March, but declining buyer activity is almost certainly forcing sellers to drop their prices. \u201cBrexit uncertainty is playing a role, with buyers still in the dark over which way the wind is going to end up blowing, but affordability is almost certainly dampening price growth. \u201cIf the annual price growth drops any lower, we will see the lowest figures in six years, and with price falls registering outside London and the South East, this is starting to look more likely. Further price falls may be needed to bring buyers back to the table, especially while they wait on Brexit to be decided.\u201d There\u2019s a big difference between \u2018more affordable\u2019 and \u2018actually affordable\u2019. Despite the recent slowdown, getting onto the UK housing ladder - or shimmying up a few rungs - is a real challenge. That\u2019s because house prices accelerated much faster than earnings in the last decade, creating a huge affordability gap that will take a long time to close (unless wages really boom or prices crash). The Resolution Foundation thinktank have tweeted the details: Economist Rupert Seggins points out that London house prices have still outpaced the rest of the UK over the last decade, despite weakening since the EU referendum: Richard Donnell of property website Zoopla predicts that the London house prices slide could bottom out next year: \u201cAnnual price falls in London are acting as a drag on the headline rate of UK house price growth, but after three years of price falls in London there are signs that the coverage of price falls is starting to narrow, especially looking at growth over the last three months. We expect the pace of annual price falls in London to moderate over 2019 and in 2020. In late 2018 the proportion of local London markets experiencing annual price falls peaked at 80% and has been steadily declining since this time, over the last three months just 28% of markets registered price falls in London. Average residential values in London are bottoming out for now and we predict sales volumes will slowly start to grow across late 2019 and market fluidity will gradually return. More reaction to the slide in London house prices: UK house prices actually peaked last summer, when the average property changed hands for \u00a3232,000. Today\u2019s data shows the average UK house price was \u00a3229,000 in May 2019, up \u00a32,000 compared with the previous year. UK house price growth has been slowing steadily since the EU referendum in 2016. At just 1.2%, house price inflation is at its joint lowest since 2013. This offers some relief to those trying to get onto the housing ladder, as wages are rising by 3.6% (according to yesterday\u2019s labour market data). Brexit uncertainty and the sheer cost of buying property in London are both weighing on the capital\u2019s housing market. So argues Jonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris: \u2019House price growth is slowing as sentiment continues to weaken, partly as a result of Brexit uncertainty. While prices fell in London by 4.4% over the year to May 2019, affordability is still an issue for those buying in the capital and south east as prices remain relatively high compared to incomes. \u2018Mortgage rates remain low and continue to support transactions. Remortgaging remains strong as many people stay and improve rather than footing the considerable bill for a move to another address.\u2019 The slump in London house prices is a reminder that the capital is vulnerable to Brexit uncertainty. Some City banks have already begun moving jobs to other European countries, for example, as they expect to lose their \u2018passporting\u2019 rights to offer services across the EU after Brexit. European Union migrants based in the capital may also be holding off buying a home until they know the UK\u2019s future relationship with the rest of the Europe. Many have already left Britain, with net migration turning negative late last year. On a regional basis, house prices are rising faster in Scotland (+2.8%), Wales (+3%) and Northern Ireland (+3.5%) than in England (+1.0%). This chart shows how English house price growth has slowed sharply, dragging the UK-wide growth rate down to 1.2%. And within England, house price growth has been rather stronger in the North than the South: The slump in London house prices is quite a shock - here\u2019s some snap reaction: The average London house now costs \u00a3457,000, the ONS says, compared with \u00a3488,527 in July 2017. Despite recent declines, London is still the most expensive place to buy a house, followed by the South East (\u00a3324,000 on average) and the East of England (\u00a3324,000). In the North East, property is changing hands for \u00a3128,000 on average -- still below the levels before the financial crisis a decade ago (when Northern Rock\u2019s reckless lending policies had driven prices up). OUCH! London house prices have suffered their biggest fall in a decade. Prices in the capital slumped by 4.4% year-on-year in May, the ONS reports, worse than the 1.7% decline recorded in April. That\u2019s the weakest performance since August 2009, after the financial crisis, when prices slumped by 7% year-on-year. Prices in the North East also declined, by 0.7%. Overall, UK house prices increased by 1.2% in the year to May 2019, down from 1.5% in April 2019. The ONS says: Over the past three years, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England. More to follow! Newsflash: Britain\u2019s inflation rate stuck at 2.0% in June for the second month running. That means workers are still benefitting from real wage gains -- earnings grew by 3.6% per year in the last quarter. The Office for National Statistics says that the prices of motor fuels, accommodation services and electricity, gas and other fuels dropped month-on-month, while clothing and food prices rose. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, explains: The overall rate of inflation remains steady, with no change in pace this month. Petrol and diesel prices fell this year but rose a year ago, while clothes prices dropped by less than this time last year.\u201d Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, fears that the pound will be pummelled to fresh lows through the summer: The Pound hit a two-and-a-half-year low against the US Dollar and is currently trading below $1.2390. Sterling weakness, to some extent, results from seasonal factors, as it tends to happen during the British summer, but is mainly explained by what is going on in the political sphere. The willingness to stomach a no-deal Brexit has been growing in the UK, as the political debate concerning who will be the next British Prime Minister has reduced itself to that lowest common denominator, with both candidates boasting about their readiness to walk away from the EU without a deal. It is therefore hardly surprising that the markets are stepping up preparations for what is seen as the worst possible scenario for the UK\u2019s economy. Looking ahead to the rest of the summer, Pound risk is surely to the downside. UK holidaymakers heading abroad this summer will feel the impact of the pound\u2019s slide. Sterling will buy less at the foreign exchange desk, so hotels, meals and ice-creams on the beach will all cost more. As Bloomberg puts it: The currency is down 4% against the euro, 5% against the dollar and 6% against the Turkish lira since mid-April. Those holidaying in Brazil will find their spending power particularly diminished, thanks to sterling\u2019s 8% drop against the real in the period. The slump in the pound this week underlines the fact that political risk is a key threat to the UK economy. A Bank of England survey released last week showed that political instability is the top threat worrying banks, asset managers, hedge funds, pension funds and other investors. Other worries include a house price crash, a slowdown in the global economy, or a crippling cyber attack. Credit rating agency DBRS has cited this work in a new report this morning, warning that instability in Westminster could rock the markets. They say: The number one risk cited this year is U.K. political risk. The second- and third-largest risks identified were geopolitical risk and the risk of a cyber attack. These three risks have been consistently at the forefront of survey respondents\u2019 minds for over a year and roughly represent a combined 50% of the worries of the financial market participants. Notably, the risks that have shown signs of rising are that of an economic downturn (though not in the U.K.), and, likely as a result, a risk of financial market disruption. Historical worries such as sovereign risk, funding, interest rates, regulation and property prices have all diminished. Between 2011 and 2013, sovereign risk was highlighted as the top risk to the financial system in the U.K., but since 2006, the number one concern has been by U.K. political risk. Things aren\u2019t looking too rosy in Europe\u2019s economy either. European car sales plunged by 7.8% year-on-year in June, new figures from industry body ACEA show. That includes an 8.4% slide in France, an 8.3% slump in Spain, and a 4.7% decline in Germany. ACEA says the sharp drop is partly because there were fewer working days in June 2019 than a year earlier. But the wider picture isn\u2019t good. So far his year, EU car registrations are down 3.1% compared to 2018. This may indicate that consumer confidence is weakening, as the wider European economy slows. Brexit worries are also weighing on the London stock market this morning. Shares in housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon are down 1% -- they would be hit hard if a no-deal Brexit hurt consumer confidence. The broader FTSE 100 has dipped a little, down 9 points at 7568. Neil Wilson of Markets.com fears that the pound could slump back towards the $1.21 mark, last seen in March 2017. He explains: Make no mistake, this decline in the pound is down to traders pricing in a higher chance of a no-deal exit. Ongoing uncertainty about the direction of Brexit it what is really driving the pound. We need to await the outcome of the Tory leadership race. There is a chance that the pound could find some bargain hunters if they feel likely winner Boris Johnson will soften his views on a hard exit on October 31st. Both leadership candidates are taking the hard line on Brexit to appeal to the Tory membership, but once faced with the granite reality of Number 10, recalcitrant MPs and the EU, realpolitik will win. That said, we are hurtling towards no deal and it may prove a disastrous move for a future PM to delay again. The pound has now lost eight whole cents against the US dollar in the last two months, as the Conservative Party leadership contest has rumbled on. This chart, from the Financial Times, shows how sterling has been the weakest major currency since March - when the Brexit deadline was delayed by another six months. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is under the cosh this morning as another bout of Brexit jitters grip the financial markets. After a nervy selloff yesterday, sterling is suffering again this morning. It is languishing below the $1.24 mark at just $1.2389, its weakest point since early April 2017. It\u2019s also struggling against the euro, having dropped to just \u20ac1.1056 for the first time since January. Anxiety over a no-deal Brexit has risen, after both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt vowed to ditch the Northern Ireland backstop - something Europe has rejected several times. News that Johnson could schedule the next Queen\u2019s Speech to ensure Parliament was shut before the 31st October Brexit deadline is also worrying investors. The established view in the City had been that a no-deal Brexit was unlikely, and that a further delay, perhaps accompanied by a general election, was on the cards. The prospect that the next prime minister might slam his foot down on the no-deal accelerator is making traders rethink. Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets says sterling could easily suffer further losses: With markets still underestimating a hard Brexit and a potentially dovish Bank of England the Pound will remain extremely vulnerable in a dynamic shift to a \u2018no-deal\u2019 stance from Brussels before the autumn. David Lowe, head of international trade at law firm Gowling WLG, is also concerned: \u201cA Boris Johnson proposal to scrap the Irish backstop has a high chance of being rejected and not seen by the EU as a good reason. And then the UK risks stepping off into the unknown of a no-deal Brexit on Halloween.\u201d Also coming up today The latest UK inflation data is released this morning, showing how the cost of living keeps rising. Economists predict consumer prices rose by 2.0% year-on-year in June, as in May, and bang on the Bank of England\u2019s target. If so, that would mean earnings are still rising faster than prices [ we learned yesterday that wages are rising at 3.6%]. But despite wages picking up, UK households\u2019 incomes have just suffered the weakest growth outside of recessions since records began in 1961, according to the Resolution Foundation. We\u2019ll also check out the latest official house price data - likely to show a slowdown, led by London and the South East. The markets may be subdued, as anxiety over US-China trade talks weighs on shares.

      "bodyText": "Italian and US police have launched a coordinated crackdown on a Sicilian mafia family that was seeking to rebuild its power base after years of exile in the United States, Italian investigators said on Wednesday. More than 200 police, including officers from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), arrested 18 people in Sicily as part of their investigation into the Inzerillo clan in the island\u2019s capital Palermo and the allied New York-based Gambino family. A 19th suspect was arrested in the United States. Sicily\u2019s organised crime group, known as Cosa Nostra (Our Thing), has been in a state of flux since 2017, when its boss of bosses Salvatore \u201cTot\u00f2\u201d Riina died in prison, where he had spent almost a quarter of a century. Riina launched a ferocious mafia war on the Mediterranean island in the 1980s, chasing the Inzerillo family out of their stronghold in the Palermo suburb of Passo di Rigano and into self-imposed US exile. But Riina\u2019s death gave the Inzerillo family a chance to attempt to reclaim its old territory, with the help of allies in New York, said police. \u201cThose Riina wanted dead were creating a special link between Palermo and New York,\u201d said the Italian prosecutor Roberto Tartaglia. Salvatore Lupo, a history professor and mafia expert at the University of Palermo, said that those seeking to rebuild power in Palermo are \u201cthe cousins, sons of the mobsters who were forced to move out\u201d. \u201cThe surname is the same,\u201d added Lupo. \u201cRiina said that if they ever came back, his men would kill them. We\u2019ve had some tensions in recent years, as there were mobsters in Palermo still loyal to the Corleonesi and didn\u2019t want the Inzerillos to come back, they don\u2019t want Americans in Italy. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the police have arrested them before they started to kill people. We no longer want to see dead bodies in Palermo.\u201d The investigation \u2013 dubbed \u201cNew Connection\u201d by the Italian police \u2013 has registered the strong bond established between Cosa Nostra Palermo and US organised crime,\u201d particularly the Gambino clan, a police statement said. There was no immediate comment from either the Gambino or Inzerillo families. The Gambinos are one of the five historic Italian-American mafia families in New York. Past charges against family operatives have included murder, loan sharking and illegal drug distribution. The reported crime boss of the family, Francesco \u201cFranky Boy\u201d Cali, was gunned down in front of his Staten Island home in March \u2013 a killing that deeply alarmed the Inzerillo clan. FBI officers and Italian colleagues with international search warrants carried out raids on three properties in New Jersey, Staten Island and Philadelphia, police said. Italian police said the suspects arrested on Wednesday faced a string of charges, including membership of the mafia, aggravated extortion, fraud and \u201cunfair competition\u201d. Among those detained was Salvatore Gambino, the mayor of a village near Palermo, and Tommaso and Francesco Inzerillo, close relatives of Salvatore Inzerillo who was killed by Riina in 1981. Once all-powerful in Sicily, Cosa Nostra has been squeezed over the past two decades, with many bosses jailed, businesses sequestered and locals increasingly ready to defy it. Prosecutors have warned repeatedly that the group is looking to rebuild. The state\u2019s fight against the mafia got serious in 1992 after the group murdered two of Italy\u2019s top magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, triggering national outrage and finally forcing complacent politicians to act. Friday marks the 27th anniversary of Borsellino\u2019s death. The Italian daily La Repubblica reported the arrests under the headline \u201cThe Godfather returns\u201d. \u201cIn Palermo, it\u2019s 3am, and muggy. In New York, it\u2019s 9pm on an evening that looks like rain,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cA WhatsApp message is sent.

Peter White Emeritus professor of psychological medicine, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff writes that research into anorexia shows substantial genetic causation (Opinion, 17 July) but history shows little record of self-starving behaviour. It was thankfully very rare. The current tragedy of anorexia is of great concern. But it is a quite recent phenomenon. To suggest its causes are rooted in DNA is clearly incorrect. To suggest this to a person suffering anorexia is at best to distract them from what to do to relieve their troubles.

It did not \u201cland\u201d happily. He said the press could be like a \u201cferal beast\u201d and, unsurprisingly, when they wrote it up the following day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/12/tonyblair.labour\">the newspapers took a dim view. </a>In some ways it was a gutless speech - he singled out the Independent for criticism, but not the Daily Mail - but some of its analysis was sound, and it was vindicated by the Leveson inquiry.</p> \n  <p>Theresa May has also given a valedictory speech on a general topic, the state of politics. Her general point, that opinion in Britain and elsewhere is becoming increasingly polarised and that this is making compromise harder, was a sound one. In fact, it is one of the great truths of our time. And yet the speech as a whole was exceptionally poor, mainly for two reasons.</p> \n  <p>First, as many people have been pointing out on Twitter (roundup coming soon), May refused to accept any responsibility at all for this state of affairs. As a speech, it was striking for its lack of self-awareness. You can understand why a prime minister might not want to telegraph their flaws at the start of their premiership, but with just seven days left in office to go, an element of contrition would have been welcome. It would be wrong to claim that May is wholly to blame for our Brexit deadlock (it is possible that no other PM could have found a compromise acceptable to parliament), but May herself played a part in entrenching divisions by pandering to the Brexiter right in her first few months in office,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/16/tory-leadership-latest-news-johnson-will-bring-down-government-if-he-goes-for-no-deal-brexit-says-top-tory-live-news?page=with:block-5d2de76e8f08d0b6ca531ba8#block-5d2de76e8f08d0b6ca531ba8\"> when she was laying down red lines that made subsequent compromise much harder. </a>This was the period when Nigel Farage found it hard to fault a word she said. When she was asked to address this in the Q&amp;A, she just reacted angrily. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2f325c8f08d0b6ca5326fa#block-5d2f325c8f08d0b6ca5326fa\">3.39pm.) </a></p> \n  <p>The second problem with the speech, partially related to the first, was that it was almost devoid of analysis. May painted a recognisable picture of a world where opinions are increasingly divided and extreme, but had nothing to say about how we\u2019ve got here. Is it social media? Loss of faith in neoliberalism, or capitalism generally, to deliver rising prosperity? A backlash against multiculturalism? A rise in nationalism? Russian meddling? I don\u2019t know. But May does not seem to know either, and she supposedly has access to the finest minds in government. The absence of an analytic framework in the speech also meant its prescriptions were rather meaningless. We should all be a bit nicer to each other and compromise, she said. But if she had worked out the cause of the problem, she would have been better placed to argue for a solution.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-17T15:48:56.158Z\">at 4.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2f35968f0845f89e30ef3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-17T14:52:20.645Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: How worried are you about what is happening in the US?

The invasion took place 16 years ago. But it still affects political thinking in Britain profoundly (it helps to explain Jeremy Corbyn becoming Labour leader, for example) and so it is surprising that an interview given by <strong>Tony Blair</strong> to Prospect magazine has not attracted more attention.</p> \n  <p>Blair does not go as far as to admit that the decision to join the US invasion of Iraq was wrong. But in the interview he does seems to go further than he has ever done before in suggesting that, if he had his time again, he would have taken a different decision.</p> \n  <p>Blair spoke to Prospect\u2019s <strong>Steve Bloomfield </strong>for <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/tony-blair-second-thoughts-war-iraq-liberal-interventionism\">a long article Bloomfield was writing about the case for liberal intervention.</a> Bloomfield raises the Chicago speech Blair gave in 1999, in which Blair set five tests he thought should apply before a country intervenes militarily in another. Bloomfield goes on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Few speeches by a British prime minister have been as influential, so the tests are worth recapping: \u201cFirst, are we sure of our case? [\u2026] Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? [\u2026] Third, on the basis of a practical assessment of the situation, are there military operations we can sensibly and prudently undertake? Fourth, are we prepared for the long term? [\u2026] And finally, do we have national interests involved?\u201d</p> \n   <p>Calling a question a test, however, doesn\u2019t make the answer to it any less subjective\u2014or contentious. While there was relatively little opposition to Britain\u2019s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and in Sierra Leone a year later, the same could not be said for Iraq. Blair still won\u2019t admit that Iraq missed his tests, although many others certainly do. But in talking, he did admit for the first time that \u201cthere were elements that were missing\u201d from his original doctrine. He now wanted \u201cvery strongly\u201d to add two more tests, narrowing the circumstances in which going to war is wise.</p> \n   <p>The first\u2014and most controversial\u2014is to consider \u201cif you\u2019re going into a country, where there are going to be strong, Islamist influences at play\u2026 whose very purpose is to destabilise what you\u2019re trying to do\u2026 who are prepared to kill and die in pursuit of that.\u201d This, he said, is \u201cwhat we found in Iraq and Afghanistan, what the Russians and Iranians and others found in Syria, and what the [Saudi-led] coalition forces are finding in Yemen.\u201d His use of the very specific word \u201cIslamists,\u201d when \u201cinsurgents\u201d would make the same point more generally, is telling.</p> \n   <p>Blair\u2019s second new test is public opinion at home. \u201cI think it is difficult to do this if it\u2019s going to be a long-term project, and your own country is divided about it.\u201d Especially, he added, if there is a change in government \u201cand the people who come after you have no particular interest in seeing that long-term project through.\u201d These extra tests might seem almost custom-made to acknowledge the disaster of Iraq. All he wants to say about that conflict however is that it was \u201cnot a bad or ignoble mission.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>From this account Blair seems unwilling to publicly acknowledge the implications of his two new tests. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/06/03/remembering-iraq\">The Iraq invasion did have public support in 2003,</a> but that support was shallow and did not last long, and soon the invasion was unpopular. So on the public opinion test, given what Blair says about a \u201clong-term project\u201d, Iraq would fail. And obviously it would fail on the \u201cIslamist influences\u201d test. Blair seems to be implying the UK should not have participated, even if he does not want to so explicitly.</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve phrased it like that because, as <strong>J</strong><strong>on Davis </strong>and<strong> John Rentoul</strong> argue in their excellent new book on the Blair government, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/heroes-or-villains-9780199608850?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Heroes or Villains? The Blair Government Reconsidered, </a>Blair is treated as if he were single-handedly responsible for what happened in Iraq, when in fact George W Bush was determined to invade anyway. Davis and Rentoul explain:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In fact, the US government had already decided to invade Iraq and the decision for the British government was whether United Kingdom forces would join them.

It wasn\u2019t a glorious triumph, and even on the Tory side there is precious little evidence of MPs willing to credit her with a legacy (if Roger Gale is the best you can get when looking for a character reference, see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2f05418f0845f89e30ec3b#block-5d2f05418f0845f89e30ec3b\">12.25pm, </a>you\u2019re not doing well), but in the key encounter with Jeremy Corbyn, May assailed him unremittingly. You can argue that PMQs is meant to be about the PM defending her record, not the leader of the opposition defending his, but that rather misses that point that PMQs it not so much a career performance evaluation as a contest for political authority, and that means attacks on the opposition can be fair. Given the unusual circumstances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/tom-watson-backs-labour-motion-auto-exclude-racism\">Labour peers taking out a newspaper advert to rubbish their own leader, </a>May\u2019s decision to go on about it was reasonable. Corbyn did not allow himself to be wholly derailed, and on air quality more than climate change, he had May in real difficulty, because she did not seem to have any defence to the points he was putting. But he was on the defensive throughout. In response to May\u2019s jibes about antisemitism Corbyn could probably have made more of the point about 60% of Tory members thinking Islam is a threat to society (it wasn\u2019t enough to raise the point - he should have challenged May to say whether she agreed with them) and the whole racism row eclipsed the arguments he was seeking to make. To the public at large it may not have been very edifying - two politicians arguing who\u2019s the more racist - but May seemed to leave her MPs quite cheered by the exchanges, whereas Corbyn didn\u2019t, and so on that metric she came out top.</p> \n  <p>In recent PMQs Corbyn has said little about the probable next Tory leader, Boris Johnson. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford has been much more willing to focus on the opponent his party will be facing in the autumn, and we saw that again today when he referenced Boris Johnson\u2019s history of using racist language in newspaper columns. But it was only a short reference, and mostly what was strange about today was about how little was said about the Tory leadership contest, or the Brexit crisis that is likely to erupt soon afterwards. Earlier, after Philip Hammond labelled some of the Brexit thinking prevalent in the Johnson camp \u201cterrifying\u201d (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/17/brexit-tory-leadership-pmqs-boris-johnson-theresa-may-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-strategies-for-ending-in-work-poverty-live-news?page=with:block-5d2ee8cd8f0845f89e30ead0#block-5d2ee8cd8f0845f89e30ead0\"> 10.29am)</a>, I said this was bound to come up at PMQs.

Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Last week, the chancellor, Philip Hammond warned against a no-deal Brexit, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/02/brexit-european-parliament-tory-leadership-nigel-farage/\">suggesting it would cost the UK economy \u00a390 billion</a>. It is disappointing to see his predictions still so heavily reliant on the Treasury\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d economic model first published in November 2018 \u2013 especially when several recent models employed by economists independent of the government, notably the<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2018/09/23/chancellor-must-come-clean-doom-laden-forecasts/\"> World Trade Model developed at Cardiff University</a>, have found the opposite: that the total positive impact of no-deal could be in the region of about \u00a380 billion.</p> \n   <p>This \u00a3170 billion discrepancy can be accounted for by examining the assumptions fed into the Treasury model, which range from the absurd to the merely dubious.

But we also are asking ourselves more fundamental questions.</p> \n   <p>We need a structurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision, and of course a financial safety net as well.</p> \n   <p>Without any one of these three elements, we will not be able to achieve the sustained eradication of poverty, the dramatic narrowing of inequality, and the transformation of people\u2019s lives that will be the central purpose of the next Labour government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McDonnell will be speaking at the launch of the Resolution Foundation\u2019s annual living standards audit.

      "bodyText": "Peers have voted by a majority of 103 for an amendment intended to stop the next prime minister being able to prorogue parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, has welcomed the vote, saying he hopes it does not get overturned by the government in the Commons tomorrow. Tomorrow\u2019s vote should be close because the government lost by just one vote when MPs last debated something similar, and then only because a whip failed to vote by mistake. (See 5.03pm.) Theresa May has criticised absolutism in politics in what appeared to be a coded swipe at populist politicians such as Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said it is \u201cterrifying\u201d that one of Boris Johnson\u2019s close allies, Jacob Rees-Mogg, believes a no-deal Brexit will boost the economy. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have traded blows in the House of Commons over antisemitism and Islamophobia, each demanding an apology for racism in their respective parties. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Thirteen Tory peers rebelled against the government and voted for the Anderson amendment, according to the division list. The Anderson amendment (see 4.50pm) has passed by 272 votes to 169 - a majority of 103. This means the bill, as now amended, could make it illegal for the government to prorogue parliament in the autumn if the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland has not been restored. The government will almost certainly try to reverse this when the bill returns to the Commons tomorrow. Dominic Grieve only got his amendment passed by a single vote in the Commons last week, after a government whip forgot to vote, and Grieve lost votes on other related amendments, and so there must be a good chance of this afternoon\u2019s vote being overturned. In the House of Lords peers are now voting on an amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation bill) that is designed to stop a future prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. The amendment has been tabled by the crossbench peer David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terror legislation, with support from Labour and the Lib Dems. It builds on an amendment to the bill passed in the Commons last week when MPs backed a proposal from Dominic Grieve, the Tory pro-European, calling for fortnightly reports from the government on progress being made towards restoring the power-sharing executive. Anderson\u2019s amendment, amendment 3, would ensure these have to be debated. This is what it says: Page 2, line 20, leave out subsection (2) and insert\u2014 \u201c(2A) The secretary of state must make arrangements for\u2014 (a) a copy of each report published under subsection (1) to be laid before each house of parliament by the end of the day on which it is published, (b) a motion in neutral terms, to the effect that the House of Commons has considered the report, to be moved in the House of Commons by a minister of the crown, and (c) a motion for the House of Lords to take note of the report to be tabled in the House of Lords and moved by a minister of the crown. (2B) The motions required under subsections (2A)(b) and (c) must be moved in the relevant house by a minister of the crown within the period of five calendar days beginning with the end of the day on which the report is laid before parliament.\u201d This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about Theresa May\u2019s speech. In the Westminster village, it is getting panned. From my colleague John Crace From the Times\u2019 Quentin Letts From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire From my colleague Paul Johnson From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From the Independent\u2019s Ashley Cowburn From my colleague Owen Jones From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From my colleague Jessica Elgot From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes From ConservativeHome\u2019s Mark Wallace This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Shortly before Tony Blair stood down he gave a speech on the media. It did not \u201cland\u201d happily. He said the press could be like a \u201cferal beast\u201d and, unsurprisingly, when they wrote it up the following day, the newspapers took a dim view. In some ways it was a gutless speech - he singled out the Independent for criticism, but not the Daily Mail - but some of its analysis was sound, and it was vindicated by the Leveson inquiry. Theresa May has also given a valedictory speech on a general topic, the state of politics. Her general point, that opinion in Britain and elsewhere is becoming increasingly polarised and that this is making compromise harder, was a sound one. In fact, it is one of the great truths of our time. And yet the speech as a whole was exceptionally poor, mainly for two reasons. First, as many people have been pointing out on Twitter (roundup coming soon), May refused to accept any responsibility at all for this state of affairs. As a speech, it was striking for its lack of self-awareness. You can understand why a prime minister might not want to telegraph their flaws at the start of their premiership, but with just seven days left in office to go, an element of contrition would have been welcome. It would be wrong to claim that May is wholly to blame for our Brexit deadlock (it is possible that no other PM could have found a compromise acceptable to parliament), but May herself played a part in entrenching divisions by pandering to the Brexiter right in her first few months in office, when she was laying down red lines that made subsequent compromise much harder. This was the period when Nigel Farage found it hard to fault a word she said. When she was asked to address this in the Q&amp;A, she just reacted angrily. (See 3.39pm.) The second problem with the speech, partially related to the first, was that it was almost devoid of analysis. May painted a recognisable picture of a world where opinions are increasingly divided and extreme, but had nothing to say about how we\u2019ve got here. Is it social media? Loss of faith in neoliberalism, or capitalism generally, to deliver rising prosperity? A backlash against multiculturalism? A rise in nationalism? Russian meddling? I don\u2019t know. But May does not seem to know either, and she supposedly has access to the finest minds in government. The absence of an analytic framework in the speech also meant its prescriptions were rather meaningless. We should all be a bit nicer to each other and compromise, she said. But if she had worked out the cause of the problem, she would have been better placed to argue for a solution. Q: How worried are you about what is happening in the US? How should your successors handle this relationship? May says the special relationship will remain, regardless of who is in the White House. She says the US should accept the need for multilateral organisations. And that\u2019s it. The speech is over. I will post a verdict and reaction shortly. Q: What advice do you have for your successor in terms of dealing with China? May says the UK wants good economic ties with China. But the UK will continue to express its concerns over matters like the joint declaration for Hong Kong. Q: Have you left the country and your party in a better or worse state? And you do not seem to take any responsiblity for the effects your own words have had, like talking about EU nationals as queue jumpers? May says she did accept that she should not have used the phrase about EU nationals jumping the queue. She says it is a matter of deep regret that she has not been able to get Brexit over the line. She did everything she could, including putting her own job on the line. She says the Tory party has rising membership. (That is probably largely to do with people joining over the last few months because they knew a leadership election was coming.) Q: What is your message for investors thinking about the future? Come to the UK, says May. She says investment in the UK had held up despite the Brexit negotiations. She says that is a tribute to the underlying strength of the British economy. May is now taking questions from non-journalists. Q: You set up Women2Win to get female candidates selected for the Tories. But progress has been glacial. Will you come back and help? May says she will continue to champion this cause. She says you get better decisions with greater diversity. Q: Did you play any part in the extradition of Hashem Abedi to the UK over the Manchester bombing? May says this is an important moment for the investigation. Q: Who were you referring to when you spoke about absolutism? Did you mean President Trump or Boris Johnson? May says she was making a general point. Q: Boris Johnson says the backstop is dead. He wants to sort out the border issue after the UK has left. Is this sensible? May says it will be up to her successor to decide how they proceed. She says the Belfast/Good Friday agreement contains an essential compromise. People in Northern Ireland can have Irish citizenship, and cross the border easily. That is why she thought that was important. Q: Philip Hammond said today that he is terrified of how people close to Boris Johnson think a no-deal Brexit would not harm the economy. Are you terrified to? May repeats her point about wanting a Brexit deal. Q: Do you share any responsibility for this? You are spoke about citizens of nowhere and used glib language, like referring to a red, white and blue Brexit. Is the naughtiest thing you have ever done still running through a wheat field? May says the stupidest thing she has done is answering this question. She says not all the language she has used has been perfect. But there has been a coarsening of language, she says. She says people should not ascribe bad motives to people who disagree with them. Q: To what extent do you think the Tory leadership contest has illustrated your arguments about extremism? May says she was not talking about the leadership contest. She says her speech reflected ideas she has been considering for some time. Q: Could you accept a no-deal Brexit? May says she thinks it would be best for the UK to leave the EU with a deal. May stressed the need to reclaim the middle ground. If we can do this, we can live together peacefully, she says. May says Dwight Eisenhower planned D-day from the building she is in. She quotes him saying people talk about the middle of the road as being a bad place. But it is where you can make progress, he said. The extremes are in the gutter. May says being prepared to compromise means knowing when not to compromise, and when to stand firm, as the UK did after the Salisbury poisoning attack by Russia. From MLex\u2019s Matthew Holehouse May says the UK is the first country trying to put forward a comprehensive set of standards for internet companies. May says compromise is needed to address the Brexit impasse. She says some people think she should have gone for a no-deal in March. Some people wanted Brexit stopped. But most people wanted Brexit done with a deal, she says. She says the problem was that politics retreated into its binary, pre-referendum positions. May says the far left wants to scrap the free market. But it is free and competitive markets that drive innovation, she says. May says Vladimir Putin claims liberalism is redundant. That is a falsehood, she says. But if we are to stand up for our values, we must rebuild support for them, she says. She calls for a politics of \u201cpragmatic conviction\u201d. May says we are living through a period of profound change. Technology is expanding opportunities, she says. But people are also feeling anxious about their prospects in the future. May says international institutions, like the UN, were also built by compromise. Only a mission from the US to Stalin persuaded the Russians to drop their demand for an all-encompassing veto. The Russians back down. And that compromise meant the UN could operate. May says it is easy to assume these international agreements will endure. But they should not be taken for granted, she says. May says the NHS was a joint effort. It was the idea of a coaltion government. The white paper proposing it was announced by a Conservative minister. Then a Labour government introduced it. When Churchill\u2019s Conservative government returned to power, it built on what had been achieved. May says this is not just a domestic problem. International politics is increasingly adversarial too, she says. She says politics is seen as a zero-sum game. This is not what politics should be about, she says. She says it is important for there to be common ground. This does not have to mean abandoning principles, she says. May says getting things done, rather than getting them said, requires qualities that have become unfashionable. One is being willing to compromise, she says. She says persuasion, team work and a willingness to make concessions are features of politics at its best. But today people are unwilling to compromise. She says our whole political discourse seems to be heading down the wrong path. There is an element of absolutism in this, she says. People are losing the ability to disagree honourably. She says the debate has descended into \u201crancour and tribal differences\u201d. May says applicants at Tory selection meetings always used to be asked if they were conviction politicians, or pragmatists. She says she never accepted the distinction. She thought politics was about implementing one\u2019s convictions. May says this could be a crucial century. Democratic politics, free speech and the rule of law have provided the nexus for progress over the last century. On that basis, today there are grounds for \u201cserious concern\u201d. Theresa May is speaking now. She says she has lived politics for 50 years, starting as an activist stuffing envelopes. In every job she has done she has been inspired by the potential of politics. Looking at the world and this country, there is a lot to be optimistic about. Extreme poverty and child mortality have been halved. People are richer and healthier than before. There is more concern for the environment. There are more women in positions of power than every before. When she was born, homosexuality was illegal. And casual bigotry has common. That has changed, she says. Robin Niblett from Chatham House is introducing the prime minister. He says the PM will take questions afterwards. Theresa May is about to give a speech on \u201cthe state of politics domestically and internationally\u201d. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Unusually, Number 10 has not given any steer at all as to what she will say. But we have been told that the speech will be quite long. Which is not necessarily very surprising. If she is determined to cover everything wrong with politics at the moment, we could be here until Friday ... In journalistic terms the Iraq war almost counts as ancient history. The invasion took place 16 years ago. But it still affects political thinking in Britain profoundly (it helps to explain Jeremy Corbyn becoming Labour leader, for example) and so it is surprising that an interview given by Tony Blair to Prospect magazine has not attracted more attention. Blair does not go as far as to admit that the decision to join the US invasion of Iraq was wrong. But in the interview he does seems to go further than he has ever done before in suggesting that, if he had his time again, he would have taken a different decision. Blair spoke to Prospect\u2019s Steve Bloomfield for a long article Bloomfield was writing about the case for liberal intervention. Bloomfield raises the Chicago speech Blair gave in 1999, in which Blair set five tests he thought should apply before a country intervenes militarily in another. Bloomfield goes on: Few speeches by a British prime minister have been as influential, so the tests are worth recapping: \u201cFirst, are we sure of our case? [\u2026] Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? [\u2026] Third, on the basis of a practical assessment of the situation, are there military operations we can sensibly and prudently undertake? Fourth, are we prepared for the long term? [\u2026] And finally, do we have national interests involved?\u201d Calling a question a test, however, doesn\u2019t make the answer to it any less subjective\u2014or contentious. While there was relatively little opposition to Britain\u2019s intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and in Sierra Leone a year later, the same could not be said for Iraq. Blair still won\u2019t admit that Iraq missed his tests, although many others certainly do. But in talking, he did admit for the first time that \u201cthere were elements that were missing\u201d from his original doctrine. He now wanted \u201cvery strongly\u201d to add two more tests, narrowing the circumstances in which going to war is wise. The first\u2014and most controversial\u2014is to consider \u201cif you\u2019re going into a country, where there are going to be strong, Islamist influences at play\u2026 whose very purpose is to destabilise what you\u2019re trying to do\u2026 who are prepared to kill and die in pursuit of that.\u201d This, he said, is \u201cwhat we found in Iraq and Afghanistan, what the Russians and Iranians and others found in Syria, and what the [Saudi-led] coalition forces are finding in Yemen.\u201d His use of the very specific word \u201cIslamists,\u201d when \u201cinsurgents\u201d would make the same point more generally, is telling. Blair\u2019s second new test is public opinion at home. \u201cI think it is difficult to do this if it\u2019s going to be a long-term project, and your own country is divided about it.\u201d Especially, he added, if there is a change in government \u201cand the people who come after you have no particular interest in seeing that long-term project through.\u201d These extra tests might seem almost custom-made to acknowledge the disaster of Iraq. All he wants to say about that conflict however is that it was \u201cnot a bad or ignoble mission.\u201d From this account Blair seems unwilling to publicly acknowledge the implications of his two new tests. The Iraq invasion did have public support in 2003, but that support was shallow and did not last long, and soon the invasion was unpopular. So on the public opinion test, given what Blair says about a \u201clong-term project\u201d, Iraq would fail. And obviously it would fail on the \u201cIslamist influences\u201d test. Blair seems to be implying the UK should not have participated, even if he does not want to so explicitly. I\u2019ve phrased it like that because, as Jon Davis and John Rentoul argue in their excellent new book on the Blair government, Heroes or Villains? The Blair Government Reconsidered, Blair is treated as if he were single-handedly responsible for what happened in Iraq, when in fact George W Bush was determined to invade anyway. Davis and Rentoul explain: In fact, the US government had already decided to invade Iraq and the decision for the British government was whether United Kingdom forces would join them. If it had decided that they should not, the invasion would have gone ahead anyway ... Nothing the British government decided would have made much difference to what happened in Iraq, or to the bloodshed that followed the invasion, or to subsequent events, such as the rise of Islamic State across the Iraqi-Syria border ... Indeed [if the UK had not participated in the invasion] British troops would probably have been sent to Iraq as part of the UN-endorsed occupation afterwards, and the situation would have been roughly the same as it is today. This is what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the Press Association this morning about the advert placed by Labour peers attacking Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s record on antisemitism. Adverts in the Guardian are quite expensive ... they could have used it on a Jewish charity tackling antisemitism, for example. But that\u2019s the way they want to communicate, they\u2019ve done it. I\u2019d have rather they just picked up the phone and came and met Jeremy. This is what Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said about the antisemitism row after PMQs. I think the polling shows it is completely rampant among members of the Conservative party, who are currently choosing Britain\u2019s next prime minister, on a scale far, far, far bigger than the incidents of antisemitism in the Labour party. And I think as a matter of anti-racist commitment it\u2019s essential that that is properly dealt with and at the moment there is no sign of that taking place. This is what the Press Association has filed about PMQs exchanges between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn trashed each other\u2019s record in dealing with allegations of racism within their parties during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. May switched focus on to Labour\u2019s approach to antisemitism after Corbyn began by asking about the government\u2019s record on climate change. Labour leader pushed back with criticism of the Conservative party\u2019s response to Islamophobia and the views of some of its members. On climate change, he also claimed that at the current rate the government will not meet its 2050 net zero emissions target \u201cuntil 2099\u201d - warning at this point it will be \u201ctoo late for our planet and our children\u201d. Speaking in the Commons, Corbyn started by asking why the government had been accused of \u201ccoasting\u201d over climate change, to which the prime minister replied: \u201cThe government has a fine record on climate change, including our recent legislation on net zero emissions. \u201cBut there is an issue that needs to be addressed in this house, and before [Corbyn] stands up and parades himself as the champion of climate change or the champion of the people or the defender of equality and fairness, he needs to apologise for his failure to deal with racism in the Labour party.\u201d May held up a newspaper advertisement, telling MPs: \u201cJust today, 60 distinguished members of the Labour party have written in the newspapers \u2018the Labour party welcomes everyone ... except, it seems, Jews. This is your legacy Mr Corbyn. You still haven\u2019t opened your eyes. You still haven\u2019t told the whole truth. You still haven\u2019t accepted your responsibility. You have failed the test of leadership\u2019. \u201cApologise now.\u201d Corbyn replied: \u201cThis party was the first to introduce anti-racist legislation into law in Britain. \u201cThis party totally opposes racism in any form whatsoever. \u201cAntisemitism has no place in our society, no place in any of our parties, and no place in any of our dialogue. Neither does any other form of racism. \u201cAnd when 60% of Tory party members think Islam is a threat to Western civilisation, and the prime minister has said she will act on Islamophobia within her own party, I hope she does. \u201cI look forward to that being dealt with as we deal with any racism that occurs within our own party as well\u201d ... In his final remarks, Corbyn said: \u201cAir pollution levels breached legal limits in 37 of the 43 areas of this country. Two-thirds of our children are growing up in an area where pollution breaches legal limits. This crisis is literally suffocating our children and damaging their health. Once again, this government is dodging its responsibility, while Labour leads the way. May, in her reply, highlighted tens of thousands of new jobs linked to renewables and clean growth before warning she would not take \u201cany lectures\u201d from Labour on the issue. She went on: \u201cHe talks about dodging responsibility - the person who has been dodging his responsibility during this PMQs is [Corbyn]. \u201cThe real disgrace is his handling of racism in the Labour Party. \u201cActivists protesting, MPs leaving, staff resigning. \u201cWhat would his great heroes of Attlee, Bevan and Benn think? \u201cLook what he has done to their party, we will never let him do it to our country.\u201d These are from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh and the Daily Mirrors\u2019 Pippa Crerar on what Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman has been saying about the advert placed by Labour peers attacking Corbyn\u2019s record on antisemitism. Here is a picture of the advert. PMQs - Snap verdict: By recent standards, that went rather well for Theresa May. It wasn\u2019t a glorious triumph, and even on the Tory side there is precious little evidence of MPs willing to credit her with a legacy (if Roger Gale is the best you can get when looking for a character reference, see 12.25pm, you\u2019re not doing well), but in the key encounter with Jeremy Corbyn, May assailed him unremittingly. You can argue that PMQs is meant to be about the PM defending her record, not the leader of the opposition defending his, but that rather misses that point that PMQs it not so much a career performance evaluation as a contest for political authority, and that means attacks on the opposition can be fair. Given the unusual circumstances, Labour peers taking out a newspaper advert to rubbish their own leader, May\u2019s decision to go on about it was reasonable. Corbyn did not allow himself to be wholly derailed, and on air quality more than climate change, he had May in real difficulty, because she did not seem to have any defence to the points he was putting. But he was on the defensive throughout. In response to May\u2019s jibes about antisemitism Corbyn could probably have made more of the point about 60% of Tory members thinking Islam is a threat to society (it wasn\u2019t enough to raise the point - he should have challenged May to say whether she agreed with them) and the whole racism row eclipsed the arguments he was seeking to make. To the public at large it may not have been very edifying - two politicians arguing who\u2019s the more racist - but May seemed to leave her MPs quite cheered by the exchanges, whereas Corbyn didn\u2019t, and so on that metric she came out top. In recent PMQs Corbyn has said little about the probable next Tory leader, Boris Johnson. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford has been much more willing to focus on the opponent his party will be facing in the autumn, and we saw that again today when he referenced Boris Johnson\u2019s history of using racist language in newspaper columns. But it was only a short reference, and mostly what was strange about today was about how little was said about the Tory leadership contest, or the Brexit crisis that is likely to erupt soon afterwards. Earlier, after Philip Hammond labelled some of the Brexit thinking prevalent in the Johnson camp \u201cterrifying\u201d (see 10.29am), I said this was bound to come up at PMQs. It didn\u2019t. It is almost as if the Commons is in denial about what might happen next. Perhaps that\u2019s just as terrifying. Labour\u2019s Kerry McCarthy asks about a constituent with spinal muscular atrophy. Recently May expressed the hope that he would be able to get the drug Spinraza. But he has not had a response yet, she says. Will May ensure he gets a response? May says she will ensure that McCarthy gets a response before she leaves office. And that\u2019s it. The SNP\u2019s John McNally asks about the seafood industry in Scotland. Longer delays for exports will lead to insurance costs going up, he says. May says her Brexit deal would have protected jobs. But the SNP did not support it, she says. The SNP\u2019s Neil Gray asks about someone with learning difficulties who has had their disability benefit cut. Disability benefits have been cut four times faster than other benefits under this government, she says. May says spending on disability benefits is at a record high. And the number of disabled people in work has increased, she says. The SNP\u2019s Kirsty Blackman says May has no right to be proud of her record on modern slavery. She says records show, according to a BuzzFeed investigation, only 16 out of 326 victims had their applications to stay in the UK approved. May says she makes no apologies for passing the Modern Slavery Act. Her government took this seriously when others did not. Nigel Evans, a Conservative, asks what the government is doing to promote LGBT rights abroad. May says she raised this issue at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting last year. She urged countries to change their laws, and she offered them UK support with this. The SNP\u2019s Patrick Grady says the hostile environment of migrants will be May\u2019s legacy. How can she spend millions on a marketing campaign saying Britain is great when for many traders from Africa the UK is closed. May says visas are an important tool to tackle illegal immigration. Visa applications from African nationals are at their highest level since 2013, she says. The SNP\u2019s Chris Stephens asks May to intervene to stop asylum seekers being made homeless in Glasgow. May says the government takes the wellbeing of asylum seekers seriously. She says in Glasgow Serco has been providing accommodation to asylum seekers at its own expense. Those people then have to move on, she says. George Freeman, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that Brexit should be a moonshot moment for British science. May says one of the first receptions she held at Number 10 was for Tim Peake, the astronaut. She says the UK is a global leader in science. Robert Halfon, a Conservative, says he recently met constituents who moved into Help to Buy homes build by Persimmon. The houses are shoddy, he says. He says his constituents view Persimmon as \u201ccrooks, cowboys and con artists\u201d. May says developers should be building good quality housing under this scheme, Labour\u2019s Virendra Sharma asks if May will work to ensure that the next government sticks not just to the letter of the 0.7% aid spending commitment, but its spirit too. May says she is proud of the government\u2019s aid record. And this target is now in legislation, she says. She says the Conservatives committed to maintain it in their election manifesto. Rachel Maclean, a Conservative, asks about local prostate services in her constituency. May says she will consider the point raised. Labour\u2019s Paula Sherriff says rail passengers in the north asks which has been delayed the longest - the Northern Powerhouse or the next train. Does she back renationalise the railway? May says the Northern Powerhouse is there. There is a record level of funding for transport in the north. Labour\u2019s Sharon Hodgson says thousands of families will be worried about how to feed their childen over the school holiday, let alone take them on holiday. Will she ensure people who qualify for free school meals get free meals over the summer? May says a programme giving free meals and activities to children who get free school meals is being expanded this summer. Sir Roger Gale, a Conservative, says May is one of only three PMs on whose watch the world cup has been brought home. Will May allow herself the luxury of thinking history will treat her captaincy more kindly than those who have campaigned against her? May thanks Gale for his support. And she turns to the World Cup (which was not the point of Gale\u2019s question.) The Tory Daniel Kawczynski asks about a health reorganisation in his constituency. May says the government thinks clinicians should have the final say. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says May finally did the right thing this week when she criticised President Trump\u2019s racist tweets. Will she now finally condemn her own racist \u2018go home\u2019 vans? May says she said at the time that those were too blunt an instrument. But the public expect the government to deal with immigration. Blackford says the Tories were silent when May implemented a hostile environment policy for immigrants. And they were silent about Boris Johnson\u2019s racist newspaper columns. Isn\u2019t the Tory MP Guto Bebb right to criticise the party for appealing to nationalism. Scotland looks on in horror. May says the only party appealing to blatant nationalism is the SNP. Corbyn says if all emissions were counted (ie, using the Labour approach), emissions would be more than 60% higher. The government promised to take action on air pollution in poorer areas. What action has been taken? May says the government\u2019s air quality strategy is ambitious. Wonderful words, says Corbyn. But he says air pollution limits are broken in 37 out of 42 areas in this country. The Labour mayor of London is leading the way on better air quality. She says May promised action, but has not delivered. She has effectively banished onshore wind. When will this government face up and get a grip on this crisis. May says more than 400,000 jobs have been created in the renewable energy market. But she will not take any lectures when the last Labour government incentivised diesel. And Corbyn talks about dodging responsibility. But the real person dodging responsibility is Corbyn. What would Labour heroes like Attlee and Bevan think? What Corbyn is doing to Labour he must never be allowed to do to the country. Corbyn says May should look at her own record. She introduced \u201cgo home vans\u201d when she was home secretary. He says the government will not meet its zero emissions target until 2099 at the current rate of progress. Still no apology, says May. She says the government has outperformed on some of her zero emission targets. Her party is acting on climate change, she says. She is dealing with the issues that matter to people. Corbyn needs to deal with the issues that matter to her party. Corbyn says Labour passed climate change legislation. He says the government has cut measures to help renewable energy. Labour would measure total UK emissions, including what is funded abroad. Will May match that? May says her government uses the international definiton. She says last year renewable energy use hit a record level. Jeremy Corbyn also congratulates the England team, but adds some praise for the New Zealand team too. Why did the Climate Change Committee accuse the government of coasting on climate change? May says the government has a good record on climate change. Switching subject, she says Corbyn must apologise for his record on antisemitism in the Labour party. She mentions the advert placed by Labour peers. She holds it up, and quotes from it. Corbyn says Labour was the first party to pass anti-racist legislation. Antisemitism has no place in the party he says. And he says 60% of Tory members think Islam is a threat to civilisation. He hopes May will deal with Islamphobia in her party, as he will deal with racism in his party. Going back to climate change, he quotes again from the Climate Change Committee. May quotes the committee chairman praising the UK\u2019s record. She goes back to antisemitism. She says she deals with Islamophobia in her party. Any allegations are dealt with, unlike antisemitism in Labour. Corbyn can say what he wants. But last week Trevor Phillips, the former equalities commission chair, said Labour was like a textbook case of institutional racism. Sir Peter Bottomley, a Tory, asks about the a book looking at the involvement of criminals in the Olympics. And he asks about this report on the topic. May says police should investigate allegations of crime and corruption fairly. Theresa May starts by congratulating all those who she said took part in \u201ca great weekend of sport\u201d. She welcomed the England cricket team to Downing Street on Monday, she says. She says she told they they represented the best of Britain. Labour\u2019s Lilian Greenwood says Notts County, the world\u2019s oldest professional football club, is facing extinction. Will May urge the FA, the Football League and the national league to see if they can help. May says the government is not complacent. It will hold the football authorities to account. Inquiries should be made into the suitability of owners, she says. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. PMQs is starting in five minutes. The Brexit committee hearing is about to wrap up. Hilary Benn, the chairman, ends with some final questions. Q: If there is a no-deal Brexit, will EU fishermen lose the right to fish in British waters immediately? Steve Barclay says there is a difference between the legal position, and what the UK would seek to arrange. Q: Would the government ban French fishing waters from UK waters on 1 November under no-deal? Barclay says, legally, the UK would have control. But the government would try to agree a \u201ccontinuity approach\u201d. It would be in the country\u2019s interests to have reciprocal arrangements. Barclay says, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government would seek to agree a \u2018continuity approach\u2019 on fishing, allowing EU boats continued access to British waters. Q: Why should firms prepare for no-deal if Boris Johnson is saying the chances of that are just a million to one? Barclay says the legal default is no-deal. In the committee Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory Brexiter, is asking the questions now. Q: What impact do you think the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen as the new European commission president will have on the Brexit process? Barclay says Von der Leyen has been German defence minister. She has a good understanding of what the UK can contribute to Europe\u2019s security, he says. Here is the Labour MP David Lammy on Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Telegraph article about a no-deal Brexit. (See 10.29am.) The Tory MP Jonathan Djanogly goes next? Q: Would you put the chances of a no-deal Brexit at one million to one (Boris Johnson\u2019s figure)? Barclay says the government has been doing a lot of work warning people about the prospects of no-deal. Q: You seem to be saying the chances are rather higher than one million to one. Barclay says there are 24 sitting days for the Commons in September and October. The withdrawal agreement bill is complicated, he says. He says you cannot programme business in the Lords. Q: What is your assessment of the likelihood of no-deal? Barclay says he thinks no-deal is \u201cunderpriced\u201d. Barclay says no-deal Brexit is more likely than people assume. He refuses to back Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are just one million to one. (Barclay is backing Johnson for the Tory leadership.) This is what Steve Barclay told MPs about his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, at the start of today\u2019s hearing. (See 10.04am and 10.07am.) In terms of the withdrawal agreement, what I said was that the house had rejected it three times, including the third time by a significant margin; that the European election results in my view had further hardened attitudes across the house and that the text, unchanged, I did not envisage going through the house. I don\u2019t think that was a particularly controversial observation. Barclay also claimed a lot of \u201cmisleading information\u201d about his meeting had been published. The Labour MP Stephen Timms is asking questions now. Q: Would the UK lose access to EU police databases from day one under a no-deal Brexit? Barclay says that is a matter for discussion. The legal position is yes. But he says he thinks, if a no-deal looked as if it were going to happen, he thinks there would be a \u201crenewed focus\u201d on finding a solution. For example, he says the European arrest warrant system is used more by EU countries than by the UK. Barclay suggests British access to EU police and criminal databases could be maintained in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In the committee John Whittingdale, the Tory Brexiter, is asking the questions now. Q: Are Defra drawing up plans to compensate sheep farmers in the event of tariffs being imposed under a no-deal Brexit? Steve Barclay says a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of work has been done. The government is \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the potential problems. Barclay confirms car manufacturers (see 10.16am) and sheep farmers could receive compensation in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Back in the committee, Steve Barclay was asked about Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt saying any withdrawal agreement containing a Northern Ireland backstop would be unacceptable. Barclay said it was not just Johnson and Hunt saying this. He said they were reflecting the views of parliament. Turning away from the Brexit committee for a moment, the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has written an article in today\u2019s Telegraph attacking claims that a no-deal Brexit will make the UK poorer. Here is an extract. Last week, the chancellor, Philip Hammond warned against a no-deal Brexit, suggesting it would cost the UK economy \u00a390 billion. It is disappointing to see his predictions still so heavily reliant on the Treasury\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d economic model first published in November 2018 \u2013 especially when several recent models employed by economists independent of the government, notably the World Trade Model developed at Cardiff University, have found the opposite: that the total positive impact of no-deal could be in the region of about \u00a380 billion. This \u00a3170 billion discrepancy can be accounted for by examining the assumptions fed into the Treasury model, which range from the absurd to the merely dubious. The most egregious is the failure to include the annual savings from no longer paying the \u00a320 billion annual gross budget contribution to the EU. This omission tells you all you need to know about the Treasury\u2019s pessimistic mindset ... Put simply, the idea that we will be poorer in the long-term and even in the short-term after Brexit is a myth. In response Hammond has posted a tweet saying it is \u201cterrifying\u201d that someone this close to the next government (Rees-Mogg is one of Boris Johnson\u2019s leading parliamentary supporters, and could be offered a job in a Johnson government) can make these claims. We will be hearing more about this at PMQs, almost certainly. Peter Bone, a Tory Brexiter, goes next. Q: Does \u201cno-deal\u201d mean there would be no deals at all? No, says Barclay. He says there are some agreements in place that would operate in the event of no-deal. People use no-deal to mean the UK leaving without a withdrawal agreement, he says. Barclay says some side agreements with the EU would be in place in the event of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. Q: Is the government considering buying extra roll-on, roll-off ferry capacity? Barclay says a framework is in place to enable the government to purchase extra capacity. Q: Are you talking about ferries? Yes, says Barclay. Q: Do you accept the Treasury\u2019s claim that a no-deal Brexit could cost \u00a390bn? Barclay says that figure represents a cost going up to 2035. And it does not take into account any mitigating measures the Treasury might take. Q: Would the government compensate car manufacturers from the impact of tariffs that would be imposed under no-deal? Barclay says the government has been in discussion with the car industry. He says other policy decisions would have to be taken into account. The picture is \u201cmore nuanced\u201d than Benn suggests, he says. What I\u2019m saying is we are having extensive discussions with the industry, including the prime minister this week, because it is more nuanced ... Of course there will be impact, but the future trend is into areas such as electric vehicles and there\u2019s a huge amount the government can do in those areas, it\u2019s not just what we have got in terms of the status quo. Q: But a 10% tariff is not a nuance. It is a cost. Barclay says 80% of goods would be tariff free under the new regime. But the car sector would be affected. He says the tariffs on parts being imported would not be as high as Benn implies. Q: You imply this problem can be managed. But the evidence we have had from these sectors shows they are not relaxed. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says a no-deal Brexit is not an option. Barclay says it is factually incorrect to say no-deal is not an option. It would be disruptive, he says. But there would be mitigating things the government could do. They would not be a panacea, he says. He says the government would have to look at what support it could give to the industry. Barclay suggests the government is considering compensation for the car industry to make up for the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Benn asks about a claim from the president of the National Farmers Union that \u201ca large percentage\u201d of the country\u2019s sheep would have to be slaughtered in the event of a no-deal Brexit because they could not be exported. Barclay says the government has been talking to the farming sector about this. He admits that some sectors of the economy would be damaged by a no-deal Brexit. Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Brexit committee, asks about the Times\u2019 story. (See 10.04am.) Steve Barclay says his meeting with Michel Barnier has been misrepresented. He says he was just making the point to Barnier that the withdrawal agreement as it stands would not get through parliament. He says all members of the committee would agree with this assessment. Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. There will be a live feed here. Barclay is going to to be asked about his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels last week. According to the Times\u2019 Bruno Waterfield, the encounter was acrimonious. Here is an extract from his story (paywall). Brussels is preparing for \u201cbrutal\u201d talks with the next prime minister after the Brexit secretary told Michel Barnier five times during a bad-tempered meeting that the withdrawal agreement was dead. Stephen Barclay left Mr Barnier, the EU\u2019s lead negotiator, astonished and dismayed in a \u201cconfrontational\u201d exchange last Tuesday. \u201cHe told Barnier that the withdrawal agreement was dead \u2014 not once but five times,\u201d a senior EU diplomat said. \u201cIf this is what is coming then we will be heading for no deal very quickly\u201d ... One senior diplomat close to the negotiations said it was the most hostile encounter in three years since the Brexit referendum, adding that Mr Barclay had seemed to \u201ctear up the previously constructive approach taken by Theresa May\u201d. \u201cIt worked like a megaphone but it has hardened attitudes,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIt is not the smart thing to do if a new prime minister is serious about getting a withdrawal agreement across the line. I guess Barclay is applying for a job in the Johnson cabinet.\u201d There has been speculation that the pro-European Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who has announced that he is standing down at the next election because he does not like the direction in which his party is heading, might join the Liberal Democrats. Not true, he told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics this morning. These stories keep appearing. It doesn\u2019t matter how often I deny them, they keep appearing. I will not be joining the Liberal Democrats. Bebb also confirmed that, if necessary, he might be willing to vote against the government in a no confidence debate to stop a no-deal Brexit. He explained: My farming community would be devastated by a no-deal Brexit. So I\u2019ll say very clearly, I was not elected to see a quarter of all the farmers in my constituency [Aberconwy] disappear. So I have been very clear. I would not want to do it [vote against the government on a no confidence motion]. But if I have to do something of that nature in order to stop the destruction of communities in my constituency, then it might have to come to that. On the Today programme this morning Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter former leader of the Commons who is backing Boris Johnson for the Tory leadership, said she would not support any move to prorogue parliament to stop MPs trying to block a no-deal Brexit. Johnson has not ruled out trying this strategy. Leadsom said she would not back him if he did, although she also stressed that in practice she did not think it would happen. She said: I don\u2019t think that prorogation is the right thing to do and I don\u2019t think a prime minister would choose to do that. Asked if she would support Johnson if he did try this, she replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe I would and I don\u2019t believe it will happen.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is giving a speech this morning setting out the three strategies Labour would use to eliminate in-work poverty in the first term of a Jeremy Corbyn government. According to the briefing sent out in advance, he will set out three strategies the party would adopt. 1) Structural changes to the economy: including industrial strategy, a network of regional public banks, expanded trade union rights, a \u00a310ph real living wage, workers on boards and public investment across the country 2) Public services free at the point of use paid for through taxation: ending austerity in existing public services, free school meals, free buses for young people, free childcare, restoring funding for public libraries, leisure centres and parks; 3) A strong social safety net: stopping the universal credit roll-out and fundamental review of our social security system, including an end to sanctions, establishing the principle of universalism and looking after each other in times of need. In his speech, McDonnell will also explain why Labour has abandoned promoting social mobility as its preferred means of addressing poverty. He will say: Behind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind. I reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life\u2019s essentials. A rejection of the belief that it\u2019s OK if your local factory closes, as long as you have cash transfers from the finance sector in the south east or a new warehouse opening on the edge of town paying minimum wage on its zero hour contracts. Ending poverty won\u2019t just be done in the workplace: we need to make sure the essentials of life are never denied to people because of their circumstances. So parents aren\u2019t forced to choose between feeding themselves and feeding their children or the unemployed teenager doesn\u2019t give up on job interviews because they cost \u00a35 in bus fares each time. Labour has already committed ourselves to ending sanctions and bringing work capability assessments in-house by medical professionals. But we also are asking ourselves more fundamental questions. We need a structurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision, and of course a financial safety net as well. Without any one of these three elements, we will not be able to achieve the sustained eradication of poverty, the dramatic narrowing of inequality, and the transformation of people\u2019s lives that will be the central purpose of the next Labour government. McDonnell will be speaking at the launch of the Resolution Foundation\u2019s annual living standards audit. You can read the full report here, and Larry Elliott\u2019s write-up here. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech on ending in-work poverty. As Rowena Mason reports, he will promise that Labour will eliminate the \u201cmodern-day scourge\u201d of in-work poverty by the end of the party\u2019s first full term back in office. 9.45am: Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, gives evidence to the Commons transport committee 10am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Afternoon: May gives a speech on the state of politics. Late afternoon: Peers start debating the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill. They are expected to vote on a move to beef up an amendment to the bill intended to stop the next PM proroguing parliament in the autumn to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

To be successful you have to put in a tremendous amount of hard work and not give up.\u201d",

With savoury smoothies, veg takes centre stage, and is often the only ingredient. Think of it as a cold soup in a tall glass, your morning smoothie regreened, with no sugar rush and subsequent hunger pangs; the veg\u2019s fibre hasn\u2019t been juiced out of existence and you have a bank of classic salads from which to take inspiration.</p> <p>Most recipes suggest a base \u2013 cucumber, tomato, courgette, carrot \u2013 then adding greenery (smoothie staples kale and spinach, obviously, but also lettuce, rocket, etc), season to taste, spice it up (fresh chilli, hot sauce, cayenne, ginger) and add a twist (citrus, vinegar). Lastly, texture stops a smoothie being baby food: nuts, seeds, fresh herbs, or a bit of everything, blended in but also torn and scattered on top as a garnish.

      "bodyText": "Propelled by the sugar-free movement, it\u2019s time to embrace \u2013 and imbibe \u2013 the savoury smoothie. As the US writer Sarah Barnes recently observed, \u201cin the realm of edible stuff that might make me immortal, are we all drinking our salads now?\u201d Of course, people have been putting veg \u2013 mostly green leaves \u2013 in smoothies for ages, but blending them with the likes of dates, bananas, berries, nut butters and milk. With savoury smoothies, veg takes centre stage, and is often the only ingredient. Think of it as a cold soup in a tall glass, your morning smoothie regreened, with no sugar rush and subsequent hunger pangs; the veg\u2019s fibre hasn\u2019t been juiced out of existence and you have a bank of classic salads from which to take inspiration. Most recipes suggest a base \u2013 cucumber, tomato, courgette, carrot \u2013 then adding greenery (smoothie staples kale and spinach, obviously, but also lettuce, rocket, etc), season to taste, spice it up (fresh chilli, hot sauce, cayenne, ginger) and add a twist (citrus, vinegar). Lastly, texture stops a smoothie being baby food: nuts, seeds, fresh herbs, or a bit of everything, blended in but also torn and scattered on top as a garnish. Here are three ideas to start with. Tomato, courgette, spinach and almond Put one large ripe tomato, a quarter of a large red pepper and a small courgette (all roughly chopped) into a blender with a handful each of mint and spinach (or kale) leaves. Add half a glass of water. Blitz until smooth. Add a handful of almonds and a dash of both Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce to taste. Blitz until the almonds are chopped up, then garnish with finely chopped almonds. Carrot, cucumber, celery and yoghurt Like a cheat\u2019s kanji (a fermented, probiotic Indian drink). Put one carrot, 10cm cucumber and one stick of celery with leaves (all roughly chopped) into a blender with 175g plain yoghurt, 45g oats, 1tsp wholegrain mustard, half a teaspoon of curry powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper and asafoetida. Add a little water and blitz until smooth. Season with salt, pepper and cider vinegar to taste. Garnish with cayenne or fresh coriander. Play around with the spices \u2013 you can use beetroot in here, too. Sorrel, lettuce, avocado and lemon Combine one roughly chopped carrot, a large knob of ginger, half an avocado, the juice of one lemon and handfuls of sorrel and lettuce leaves in a blender with a little water and blitz until smooth. Season with more lemon juice, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper, and garnish with some minced ginger. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2019 because during the editing process, the addition of a large knob of ginger and half an avocado were lost from the last recipe.",

We\u2019re going for a super over!\u201d</p> <p>The ICC montage of the last moments of the Cricket World Cup final has almost four million views \u2013 which isn\u2019t that impressive considering three million of them are mine. Ian Smith\u2019s commentary, in that gravelly Kiwi drawl, is spine tingling to the last second.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the moment. It\u2019s Archer to Guptill. Two to win.

The reason you turn to these back pages before the boring but important stuff at the front. I literally cannot stop thinking about that final ball. It\u2019s almost too much for those of us who don\u2019t play elite sport to comprehend. Everyone on that pitch at that moment is at the pinnacle of their sport. They have trained for years for this moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/17/real-fans-cricket-world-cup-final-freeloaders-adrian-chiles\">Real fans should have been at the Cricket World Cup final \u2013 not freeloaders | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jofra Archer is in the game. Martin Guptill is in the game. Jos Buttler is in the game. Jimmy Neesham knows he has to run as fast as he can for 44 yards. Everyone else is just waiting. Will any of what transpires be in their control? I can\u2019t stop thinking about Jason Roy. The ball is hurtling towards him off Guptill\u2019s bat, two balls after a misfield which probably cost a run out. Every time I watch it I worry he might not gather the ball cleanly, or fall over, or get cramp in both legs and just collapse \u2013 it happened to me once clean through in the last minute of a Sunday League football match.</p> <p>Then I worry about the throw. It could be wild, high, to the wrong end, right on the bounce or just straight through the square. I asked Darren Gough on TalkSport this week if he would have wanted the ball to come to him at that moment \u2013 the chance to be one of the heroes, to be part of a clip to be repeated on loop until the end of cricket. A beaming grin crossed Goughie\u2019s face, as it often does. \u201cI said to my kids as Archer was running up to bowl: \u2018Whatever you do don\u2019t hit that ball at me\u2019 \u2013 every other fielder, every single one, would have been delighted when that ball went to Roy.\u201d Even then I can\u2019t relax \u2013 I check the montage again \u2013 what if Jos Buttler doesn\u2019t take it cleanly, or treads on the stumps? I know he\u2019s practised this. I know it\u2019s regulation. And more pertinently, I know it\u2019s already happened \u2013 it\u2019s been set to music. Even still I\u2019d like to check Guptill definitely hasn\u2019t made his ground.</p> <p>There was nothing that could take away from this moment. But then there was. Jacob Rees-Mogg. I was enraged by his attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/not-cricket-jacob-rees-mogg-criticised\" title=\"\">politicise England\u2019s victory</a> with an idiotic nonsensical tweet about not needing Europe to win.

It was brave because he wasn\u2019t there. You can see the two minutes online \u2013 where I play the role of a poor man\u2019s James O\u2019Brien \u2013 listing the reasons why it\u2019s stupid, before explaining that I love this team precisely because they represent the England I know \u2013 diverse, different, interesting \u2013 as Moeen Ali <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/diversity-strength-england-win-cricket-world-cup\" title=\"\">articulated so well</a> Monday.</p> <p>The below the line comments were, in the main, surprisingly positive \u2013 plenty of \u201cwell said\u201d and \u201cspot on\u201d to the equally supportive if slightly less helpful \u201cimagine the absolute lake of gammon and white van man piss he\u2019d have boiled when he said this on air\u201d.</p> <p>At the same time I was told to \u201cgive it a rest mate. Making a mountain out of a molehill just to show how PC you are is very boring\u201d, while of course receiving many \u201cDon\u2019t mix politics and sport\u201d and the mandatory \u201cMax Rushden is a left-wing nonce though\u201d.</p> <p>The conflict of politics and sport is a frustrating one. We want it to be pure. It felt pure on Sunday. We don\u2019t want them to overlap, even if we know they do. Of course the players had to be invited to Downing Street. There\u2019s precedent. What if they hadn\u2019t been? Although I do wonder if Theresa May quickly hid the Windrush file in a pot plant as Archer walked in to the drawing room. And perhaps I\u2019m as guilty as Rees-Mogg. I criticised him for politicising a moment none of us wanted to be political. Yet my response was and still is politically charged. Another response was slightly more provocative: \u201cYou guys creamed your pants when Meghan or whatever her name is politicised sport but now don\u2019t like it when Moggy talks about it. Have a consistent standard you cunts.\u201d</p> <p>At this point I turned off my notifications because I want to put my head in the sand, just for a little while, to enjoy an incredible contest that neither side deserved to lose. New Zealand certainly didn\u2019t. And though winning matters because sport needs someone to hold the trophy, it also doesn\u2019t matter at all. That\u2019s why it\u2019s in the sports pages, and not the boring but important bit at the front of the paper.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone at the moment has a steady heart \u2026 Seven weeks of cricket, 48 games, one ball. Here\u2019s Boult, they\u2019re going to push, are we in for a super over? They\u2019ve got to go quick, they\u2019ve got to go quick. OUT! I\u2019m sure he\u2019s OUT! We\u2019re going for a super over!\u201d The ICC montage of the last moments of the Cricket World Cup final has almost four million views \u2013 which isn\u2019t that impressive considering three million of them are mine. Ian Smith\u2019s commentary, in that gravelly Kiwi drawl, is spine tingling to the last second. \u201cThis is the moment. It\u2019s Archer to Guptill. Two to win. Guptill\u2019s going to push for two. They\u2019ve got to go \u2026 The throw\u2019s got to go to the keeper\u2019s end \u2026 he\u2019s got it! England have won the World Cup! By the barest of margins \u2026 BY THE BAREST OF ALL MARGINS \u2026 absolute ecstasy for England. Agony, agony for New Zealand.\u201d And there is sport. Right there. The reason you turn to these back pages before the boring but important stuff at the front. I literally cannot stop thinking about that final ball. It\u2019s almost too much for those of us who don\u2019t play elite sport to comprehend. Everyone on that pitch at that moment is at the pinnacle of their sport. They have trained for years for this moment. Jofra Archer is in the game. Martin Guptill is in the game. Jos Buttler is in the game. Jimmy Neesham knows he has to run as fast as he can for 44 yards. Everyone else is just waiting. Will any of what transpires be in their control? I can\u2019t stop thinking about Jason Roy. The ball is hurtling towards him off Guptill\u2019s bat, two balls after a misfield which probably cost a run out. Every time I watch it I worry he might not gather the ball cleanly, or fall over, or get cramp in both legs and just collapse \u2013 it happened to me once clean through in the last minute of a Sunday League football match. Then I worry about the throw. It could be wild, high, to the wrong end, right on the bounce or just straight through the square. I asked Darren Gough on TalkSport this week if he would have wanted the ball to come to him at that moment \u2013 the chance to be one of the heroes, to be part of a clip to be repeated on loop until the end of cricket. A beaming grin crossed Goughie\u2019s face, as it often does. \u201cI said to my kids as Archer was running up to bowl: \u2018Whatever you do don\u2019t hit that ball at me\u2019 \u2013 every other fielder, every single one, would have been delighted when that ball went to Roy.\u201d Even then I can\u2019t relax \u2013 I check the montage again \u2013 what if Jos Buttler doesn\u2019t take it cleanly, or treads on the stumps? I know he\u2019s practised this. I know it\u2019s regulation. And more pertinently, I know it\u2019s already happened \u2013 it\u2019s been set to music. Even still I\u2019d like to check Guptill definitely hasn\u2019t made his ground. There was nothing that could take away from this moment. But then there was. Jacob Rees-Mogg. I was enraged by his attempt to politicise England\u2019s victory with an idiotic nonsensical tweet about not needing Europe to win. At a time when a divided nation comes together for one tiny moment, why try to score political points? I had my say on the radio \u2013 basically repeating many other more eloquent critiques. It was brave because he wasn\u2019t there. You can see the two minutes online \u2013 where I play the role of a poor man\u2019s James O\u2019Brien \u2013 listing the reasons why it\u2019s stupid, before explaining that I love this team precisely because they represent the England I know \u2013 diverse, different, interesting \u2013 as Moeen Ali articulated so well Monday. The below the line comments were, in the main, surprisingly positive \u2013 plenty of \u201cwell said\u201d and \u201cspot on\u201d to the equally supportive if slightly less helpful \u201cimagine the absolute lake of gammon and white van man piss he\u2019d have boiled when he said this on air\u201d. At the same time I was told to \u201cgive it a rest mate. Making a mountain out of a molehill just to show how PC you are is very boring\u201d, while of course receiving many \u201cDon\u2019t mix politics and sport\u201d and the mandatory \u201cMax Rushden is a left-wing nonce though\u201d. The conflict of politics and sport is a frustrating one. We want it to be pure. It felt pure on Sunday. We don\u2019t want them to overlap, even if we know they do. Of course the players had to be invited to Downing Street. There\u2019s precedent. What if they hadn\u2019t been? Although I do wonder if Theresa May quickly hid the Windrush file in a pot plant as Archer walked in to the drawing room. And perhaps I\u2019m as guilty as Rees-Mogg. I criticised him for politicising a moment none of us wanted to be political. Yet my response was and still is politically charged. Another response was slightly more provocative: \u201cYou guys creamed your pants when Meghan or whatever her name is politicised sport but now don\u2019t like it when Moggy talks about it. Have a consistent standard you cunts.\u201d At this point I turned off my notifications because I want to put my head in the sand, just for a little while, to enjoy an incredible contest that neither side deserved to lose. New Zealand certainly didn\u2019t. And though winning matters because sport needs someone to hold the trophy, it also doesn\u2019t matter at all. That\u2019s why it\u2019s in the sports pages, and not the boring but important bit at the front of the paper. The Kiwis\u2019 humility and humour in defeat, led by Kane Williamson, was maybe the most impressive part of all of this. Nasser Hussain\u2019s assessment of the New Zealand skipper nails it. \u201cYou end careers with wins and statistics and what you won but you also end your career with what sort of bloke were you, how did you play that game, and the way Kane Williamson carried himself \u2013 there are so many things that went against the Kiwis, and yet their skipper stood there at the end and did not make any excuses, what a man he is.\u201d If there is a conclusion to any of this, it\u2019s that I\u2019d rather be Kane Williamson than Jacob Rees-Mogg.",

      "bodyText": "Gibraltar\u2019s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, has flown to London to hold talks with Theresa May about the possible release of an Iranian-owned tanker that was seized a fortnight ago by the Royal Marines. The detention of the Grace 1 and its cargo of 2.1m barrels of oil, which was believed to have been headed to Syria in breach of EU sanctions, has turned into a focal point of severe friction between Tehran and London as Iran threatens to take further steps way from the nuclear deal it signed in 2015 with the US, China, Russia and 3 EU states. The UK has been under pressure from some European and Gulf allies to release the ship. Suggested by the US, the capture occurred on 4 July when the ship unexpectedly put down an anchor in what the UK regards as its waters. Spain monitored the capture. Iranian sources say its intermediaries took up a weekend offer from Picardo to meet to discuss the situation. Speaking in the Commons, the UK\u2019s Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison, said decisions about the Panamanian-flagged tanker were a matter for Picardo. But in reality the Foreign Office will have influence over the key strategic decisions around whether the retention of the ship is either legally or diplomatically wise. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, following consultations with Picardo and the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, offered on Saturday to release the ship as long as Iran gave assurances that the ship\u2019s oil was not bound for Syria, or any other entity under EU sanctions. In a statement, Picardo said: \u201cWe would be prepared to facilitate the release of the detained assets to the rightful owner if we received guarantees that it would not be going to Syria.\u201d Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Hardtalk programme in New York on Monday, Zarif said the ship had never been bound for Syria, but would not identify the true destination. He said: \u201cWe announced from the very beginning this ship was not going to Syria.\u201d Asked where it was going, he said: \u201cIt was going to a place in the Mediterranean other than Syria. We made it clear.\u201d Iran has been exporting oil to western Turkey, and looked to have resumed oil sales to Syria after a gap of more than a year in March this year. Zarif said he would \u201cdo anything to avoid the US knowing what we are doing\u201d, pointing out that the US was unilaterally attempting to force Iran back to the negotiating table by trying to impose an unprecedented ban all Iranian oil exports. \u201cThe UK by confiscating our ship is helping the US in imposing its illegal oil sanctions against Iran,\u201d said Zarif. It is not clear if Iran has been able to give stronger assurances through other private diplomatic channels that would satisfy the Gibraltar supreme court about the oil\u2019s destination. Iran believes it is not party to the EU sanctions on Syria, one of its close allies, and has described the ship\u2019s seizure as unlawful and an act of piracy. Some independent observers say it is unusual for the UK to have intervened to force a non-EU state to comply with EU sanctions. Gibraltar\u2019s authorities arrested the Indian captain and first officer of the Grace 1, but have not pressed any charges.",

      "body": "<p>So, you want to write a record-breaking radio smash. Bad news: Snow Patrol beat you to it. Their song Chasing Cars has just been named as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/17/chasing-cars-by-snow-patrol-is-most-played-song-on-uk-radio-this-century\" title=\"\">the most popular UK radio hit of the 21st century</a>. But don\u2019t despair, because we can still learn plenty from the song\u2019s enduring success.</p> <h2><strong>Play the long game</strong></h2> <p>Fun fact: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GemKqzILV4w\" title=\"\">Chasing Cars</a> was never a No 1 record in the UK. On its release in 2006, it enjoyed a slow climb to No 6, during which time it was outsold by Paris Hilton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icpqB22c4G8\" title=\"\">Stars Are Blind</a> (which got to No 5). It was the 14th best-selling song of the year, which sounds OK until you learn that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2jDz6w-r4\" title=\"\">I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair)</a> by Sandi Thom was the fifth. But now we can prove definitively: slow and steady wins the race.</p> <h2><strong>Get it on a big TV show</strong></h2> <p>Or any TV show \u2013 every one helps. Just before its release, Chasing Cars was used in the season-three finale of One Tree Hill.

      "bodyText": "So, you want to write a record-breaking radio smash. Bad news: Snow Patrol beat you to it. Their song Chasing Cars has just been named as the most popular UK radio hit of the 21st century. But don\u2019t despair, because we can still learn plenty from the song\u2019s enduring success. Play the long game Fun fact: Chasing Cars was never a No 1 record in the UK. On its release in 2006, it enjoyed a slow climb to No 6, during which time it was outsold by Paris Hilton\u2019s Stars Are Blind (which got to No 5). It was the 14th best-selling song of the year, which sounds OK until you learn that I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair) by Sandi Thom was the fifth. But now we can prove definitively: slow and steady wins the race. Get it on a big TV show Or any TV show \u2013 every one helps. Just before its release, Chasing Cars was used in the season-three finale of One Tree Hill. Then it was used in the season-two finale of Grey\u2019s Anatomy, exposing it to a further 22.5 million US viewers and for ever entwining it in popular culture with the fates of lovelorn and preposterously attractive medical professionals. Keep it basic Chasing Cars is simple: it is based around a two-note guitar riff, while the verses consist of three lines, each containing just three or four syllables. It suits rock, pop and easy-listening stations, while the lyrics are so oblique that listeners can project their own meaning on them, for any situation. In 2016, Chasing Cars topped a list of \u201cmost requested indie funeral songs\u201d, prompting the disquieting mental image of looking at a corpse while listening to a song where someone asks you to lie down with them \u201cand just forget the world\u201d.

He\u2019s spoken to me about this issue of Normandy veterans having this benefit removed. Ted is a wonderful community activist, he is someone who contributes hugely to his community ... It doesn\u2019t sit right with me that we\u2019re withdrawing benefits from such people.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said he had the \u201cdeepest respect\u201d for the D-Day veteran who has \u201cbeen through things I hope I never have to go through\u201d.</p> <p>However, he said it was about intergenerational fairness and that channels would close if the BBC picked up the cost: \u201cThe board have come to the decision to balance two fairnesses \u2013 the fairness to people over-75, while also being fair to the majority of licence fee payers who would have to fund the \u00a3750m if the concession was to carry on.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC has repeatedly pointed out that over-75s today are wealthier than previous generations, although charities point out that this is not the case across the board and television often provides a lifeline for the lonely.</p> <p>Individuals who refuse to pay the licence fee will be committing a criminal offence, raising the prospect of elderly Britons appearing in court over their refusal to pay for the BBC. Women are also <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/07/237240/tv-licence-evasion-women\">disproportionately prosecuted</a> for non-payment of the licence fee.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s policy director, Claire Sumner, said she would contact veterans\u2019 organisations to make sure they were aware of their rights. She said one issue was that only 60% of individuals eligible for pension credit currently claim the benefit, meaning many poor over-75s will not currently be able to claim their free TV licence despite being eligible.</p> <p>Hall said the BBC was forced to pick up the cost of providing free TV licences in the immediate aftermath of the 2015 general election, following the decision made by Osborne, with no opportunity to make any counter arguments.</p> <p>\u201cI had a call from the then secretary of state, John Whittingdale, saying \u2018I\u2019ve lost the argument over the weekend and they\u2019re going to impose the over-75s concession on you\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018that\u2019s nuclear\u2019, and I laid out the consequences of that decision.\u201d</p> <p>Hall was also baffled by the Conservatives\u2019 pledge in their 2017 election manifesto to ensure TV licences remained free for over-75s, since the responsibility for the decision had already been transferred to the BBC.</p> <p>Tory party sources have previously suggested the pledge was included in error by copying and pasting lines from the 2015 manifesto in a rush to produce a manifesto to fit the deadline of Theresa May\u2019s snap election.</p>",

Lucas highlighted the case of individuals in his constituency who will have to pay for television: \u201cI\u2019ve got a constituent whose name is Ted Edwards, who\u2019s 93 years of age, who\u2019s a Normandy veteran. He\u2019s spoken to me about this issue of Normandy veterans having this benefit removed. Ted is a wonderful community activist, he is someone who contributes hugely to his community ... It doesn\u2019t sit right with me that we\u2019re withdrawing benefits from such people.\u201d The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said he had the \u201cdeepest respect\u201d for the D-Day veteran who has \u201cbeen through things I hope I never have to go through\u201d. However, he said it was about intergenerational fairness and that channels would close if the BBC picked up the cost: \u201cThe board have come to the decision to balance two fairnesses \u2013 the fairness to people over-75, while also being fair to the majority of licence fee payers who would have to fund the \u00a3750m if the concession was to carry on.\u201d The BBC has repeatedly pointed out that over-75s today are wealthier than previous generations, although charities point out that this is not the case across the board and television often provides a lifeline for the lonely. Individuals who refuse to pay the licence fee will be committing a criminal offence, raising the prospect of elderly Britons appearing in court over their refusal to pay for the BBC. Women are also disproportionately prosecuted for non-payment of the licence fee. The BBC\u2019s policy director, Claire Sumner, said she would contact veterans\u2019 organisations to make sure they were aware of their rights. She said one issue was that only 60% of individuals eligible for pension credit currently claim the benefit, meaning many poor over-75s will not currently be able to claim their free TV licence despite being eligible. Hall said the BBC was forced to pick up the cost of providing free TV licences in the immediate aftermath of the 2015 general election, following the decision made by Osborne, with no opportunity to make any counter arguments. \u201cI had a call from the then secretary of state, John Whittingdale, saying \u2018I\u2019ve lost the argument over the weekend and they\u2019re going to impose the over-75s concession on you\u2019.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018that\u2019s nuclear\u2019, and I laid out the consequences of that decision.\u201d Hall was also baffled by the Conservatives\u2019 pledge in their 2017 election manifesto to ensure TV licences remained free for over-75s, since the responsibility for the decision had already been transferred to the BBC. Tory party sources have previously suggested the pledge was included in error by copying and pasting lines from the 2015 manifesto in a rush to produce a manifesto to fit the deadline of Theresa May\u2019s snap election.",

To win without winning a stage (not incl a TT) would of course be fine for him. Just imagine if all the other bigger teams raced like Sky/Ineos there would be no Alaphilippe, Pinot, Sagan etc, riders with panache and flair. Mitchelton-Scott are here for Adam Yates but fine for Impey to go for a stage win etc.\u201d</p> <p>Well, he\u2019s hardly kept that a secret over the years. The Sky/Ineos/Brailsford plan for the Tour de France has always been to win the Tour de France. Rightly or wrongly, their tactics are purely focused on doing that and only that.

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s it from me. Tomorrow? THERE BE MOUNTAINS! Be sure to join us again. Thanks for your emails and tweets today but for now, cheerio! Here\u2019s today\u2019s quick report: Jeremy Whittle\u2019s full report will be there soon enough. Here\u2019s Caleb Ewan: \u201cThere\u2019s no other race that I\u2019ve dreamt of winning since I was a young kid. It was something so distant from Australia. To win a stage is a real dream come true.\u201d Ewan\u2019s clearly a popular man in the peloton \u2013 having spent the minutes since crossing the line being hugged by just about everyone, he can\u2019t even get through the TV interview without another rider leaning in to shake his hand and congratulate him. Tell you what, there is a tiny change at the top of the GC. Ciccone, who was caught up in the crash that did for Niki Terpstra, drops out of the top 10. Thibaut Pinot jumps back in. All the GC contenders finished in the group so there\u2019ll be no change at the top of the GC standings. Sagan stays in green, Wellens keeps the polka dots \u2026 it\u2019s very much as-you-were. A terrific sprint there from the Australian, who picks up his first win of the Tour. The sprinters have really shared out the wins thus far in this year\u2019s race and the lack of dominance has made for some incredibly tight finishes. That might have been the tightest. Van Aert gives Dylan Groenewegen the perfect lead out but Caleb Ewan storms past him to win by an inch, maybe two. A right-hander then the final straight \u2026 1km to go. Oss peels away and Van Aert takes up the strain again. 2km to go. Alex Dowsett gets on the front \u2026 and turns around to see no teammates with him. He peels off and leaves things to Daniel Oss of Bora-Hansgrohe. 3km to go. Jumbo-Visma, UAE and Sunweb are all over the front. Alaphilippe is also prominent, helping steer Viviani through these roads \u2026 4km to go. De Gendt is about to get swallowed up \u2013 he cracks with 4.6km left to the line. 6km to go. The peloton have got themselves sorted out and have the gap to De Gendt back to 30 seconds. It\u2019s a brave effort, though, and he\u2019s into the outskirts of Toulouse. 8km to go. Aime De Gendt has attacked hard. He\u2019s built up a 40 second lead. 9km to go. Another (minor) chute. De Buyst ends up in a ditch on a narrow stretch. He\u2019s Caleb Ewan\u2019s leadout man and landed pretty softly so he\u2019ll be able to recover. 10km to go. De Gendt attacks from the break \u2026 and no one can go with him. Rossetto is furious with Calmejane as the Belgian disappears up the road. Cofidis will get nothing from this despite having two riders out of four in the break, 11km to go. Jumbo-Visma, as they have been all day, are well positioned on the front of the group. Katusha-Alpecin also prominent. 15km to go. Just 26 seconds for the break now. 21km to go. Terpstra has, in fact, abandoned. Ciccone, Langeveld and Nizzolo are four minutes adrift from the peloton. The break has just under a minute on the group. 26km to go. And the peloton is one once more. Niki Terpstra has apparently remounted and is continuing, though he\u2019s on his own and a couple of minutes adrift. 27km to go. Porte and Quintana have 30 seconds to make up. Plenty of their teammates have joined them to help with the recovery effort. They should get back on in no time. Looks like Nairo Quintana and Richie Porte were caught up in that crash and now have to race to get back to the main group. Ciccone, 10th in GC, was also caught up in it and has gingerly remounted. Terpstra looks in a very bad way \u2013 could be race over for him. 31km to go. Crash in the group. Sunweb, EF and Direct Energie riders are down on the road. 32km to go. Ineos put their noses in the wind for the first time today. This is the section that might be vulnerable to crosswinds \u2026 35km to go. The peloton is beginning to get a little strung out as the pace on the front goes up. But the gap to the break is remaining consistent. 41km to go. The lead quartet have stabilised things a touch, with the gap back to the peloton 1min 10sec or thereabouts. 48km to go. The break\u2019s lead is tumbling. The quartet have only just over a minute now. 50km to go. And the break\u2019s lead is down below two minutes. Some emails \u201cI once heard the time trial be described as \u2018televised admin\u2019, so let\u2019s not forget that Miguel Indur\u00e1in won five Tours without ever winning a race stage \u2013 12 stage victories, all in time trials. So Ineos\u2019 tactics are positively thrilling,\u201d writes Simon Thomas. \u201cThroughout my time of watching the tour (since 87), there has always been a dominant rider with a team to match and routinely their dominance is \u2018bad for the sport\u2019. Until the next team that is \u2026\u201d \u201cWatching TDF in a Spanish bar in the Costa Blanca with other cyclists,\u201d writes Gareth. \u201cGuess who nobody is talking about? Team Ineos. So I\u2019m a bit concerned that Brailsford is talking about \u2018sticking the knife in\u2019. Seems uncharacteristic hubris on his part. People here are no longer seeing that team as central to the race this year, even if Thomas and Bernal are looking good.\u201d Musettes all round as the peloton go through the feed zone. The breakaway have 2min 25sec \u2013 which is more or less what they\u2019ve had since kilometre zero. Just over 72km to go. The break reach the intermediate sprint, and Perez holds off De Gendt to cross the line first and bag top points. A couple of minutes later Bora-Hansgrohe look to lead out Sagan but Viviani follows Colbrelli\u2019s wheel before popping past his Italian rival and pipping the Slovakian. My US colleague and old mucker Tom Lutz gets in touch to point out that NBC Sports haven\u2019t done their research on Geraint Thomas\u2019s heritage. And his countryman Luke Rowe is listed as hailing from Germany. Perez pops over the top of the climb first, claiming the solitary mountain point. \u201cAs an accountant, can I just assure Dan Jenkins that it\u2019s nothing like being on Team Ineos,\u201d writes Thomas Atkins. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Jonathan Castroviejo\u2019s excel skills are rubbish, and I wouldn\u2019t trust Wout Poels to put our Q2 reforecast together if my life depended on it. Horses for courses.\u201d The break have 2min 30sec and are heading towards the foot of the category four Cote de Castelnau-de-Montmiral (2.5km at 3.8%). After that it\u2019s a flat road all the way to Toulouse with the only danger the dreaded wind. It\u2019ll be a bit like that scene in The Happening \u2026 A Deceuninck-Quickstep rider sets the pace on the front of the peloton but the front end of the group is stacked with Jumbo-Visma riders prepping to set things up for Dylan Groenewegen. The break has 2min 33sec with 100km to go. \u201cPffh, most teams in Ineos\u2019 position do the same thing,\u201d writes Dan Jenkins. \u201cIf they think they\u2019ve got a real chance for the GC they put everything into winning it. Mitchelton Scott at the Giro &amp; Vuelta last year, Sunweb whenever Dumoulin\u2019s is racing. Even FDJ at this year\u2019s tour. Sunweb even had Michael Matthews training to support Dumoulin in the mountains for this year\u2019s Tour! Michael Matthews! \u201cThey\u2019re all in for the GC until they don\u2019t think they can win it. People just complain when Ineos do it because they\u2019re dominant and have the best GC riders. Oh, and if the way they raced on Monday is what it\u2019s like to be an accountant then sign me up.\u201d Having scrolled through the social media feeds of the four breakaway riders in search of an interesting tidbit or two (don\u2019t judge \u2013 there\u2019s not a huge amount happening out on the road), the best thing I can report is that Lilian Calmejane has an incredibly cute dog: An email: \u201cRe David Brailsford\u2019s \u201ctwisting the knife\u201d comments: he seems to allude patronisingly that to win stages is for the others while his focus is always as ever on the GC win,\u201d writes Alan McFarlane. \u201cSurely the whole point of cycling racing is first across the line and not race like his teams as accountants. To win without winning a stage (not incl a TT) would of course be fine for him. Just imagine if all the other bigger teams raced like Sky/Ineos there would be no Alaphilippe, Pinot, Sagan etc, riders with panache and flair. Mitchelton-Scott are here for Adam Yates but fine for Impey to go for a stage win etc.\u201d Well, he\u2019s hardly kept that a secret over the years. The Sky/Ineos/Brailsford plan for the Tour de France has always been to win the Tour de France. Rightly or wrongly, their tactics are purely focused on doing that and only that. And, given the results of the past seven years, you could say it\u2019s paid off. The breakaway quartet have extended their lead over that hill to nearly three and a half minutes. Perez crests the hill first for a couple of mountains points with De Gendt just behind him. Highlight of the day so far is the glorious scenery of the Tarn region \u2013 absolutely stunning. One kilometre to the summit of this climb. The gap is still stable just under 2min 30sec as the leaders close in on the foot of the category three Cote de Tonnac. Local interest today: Calmejane was born in Albi, while Perez lives in Toulouse. The peloton have held the gap at just over two minutes so the sprinters\u2019 teams clearly want to keep them within a manageable range. That has to be pretty dispiriting with 160km to ride. The breakaway lead stretches to over two minutes. The quartet are all over an hour down on GC so can be given plenty of space. Calmejane is either horribly out of form or has been deliberately keeping his powder dry in an attempt to gain admittance to a break. He\u2019s got decent TDF pedigree, winning a stage in 2017 and finishing 35th and 30th in the past two years. The riders exit the neutralised early kilometres and immediately a four-man break scampers up the road. Anthony Perez of Cofidis, St\u00e9phane Rossetto also of Cofidis, Total Direct Energie\u2019s Lilian Calmejane and Aim\u00e9 De Gendt of Wanty. Three French riders and a Belgian. \u201cThanks John, for sharing the EF racing film and for the tour coverage,\u201d writes Robert Betts. \u201cOn a similar theme are the films made by the Morton brothers (Lachlan and Gus) as they go on various cycle touring adventures. The brothers are good company as they ponder life outside the sport and cycling for the love of it: Thereabouts. There are three \u2018Thereabouts\u2019 films each around an hour in length.\u201d Thanks for that Robert. I have to say, I get very jealous of how good these videos look. Whenever I go out on a ride, the only photos I generally take (because I\u2019m a mature individual) are of \u2018hilarious\u2019 street names. Yesterday, for example: Off we go then. The riders roll slowly out of Albi (which looks rather lovely) in glorious sunshine. There\u2019s the chance of a bit of wind later in the stage and therefore potential for nervousness in the peloton as we get close to Toulouse. The last time the Tour finished in Toulouse was 2008. That day \u2013 in the rain \u2013 Mark Cavendish sprinted to his second stage victory. Such a shame he\u2019s not in France this time around. The riders are congregating in Albi \u2013 we\u2019ll have some racing very soon. This is how today\u2019s finish shapes up: Fancy it could be a day for Caleb Ewan to finally get a win under his belt, but we shall see. As this stage is short and pretty damn flat there\u2019s a slightly later start today \u2013 racing will get under way around 12.45pm BST with the sprint to the line coming at around 4.30pm. One man who won\u2019t be on the startline is Rick Zabel, the Katusha-Alpecin rider has the flu and has had to withdraw from the race. While we wait for things to get going here\u2019s some rest day news from our man in France, Jeremy Whittle: Rest day can often bring some pretty decent #content from teams across their social media channels. It\u2019s not Tour-related but I thought this from EF Education First on the GBDuro event was a really good watch: I can\u2019t see anything changing much in these today (fact fans: the yellow jersey has never changed hands on a stage to Toulouse). Hello all. Hope you\u2019re all feeling refreshed after a hard-earned rest day. Today the peloton blasts across Tarn, from Albi to Toulouse. It\u2019s a day for the sprinters, the last one for a while with the first taste of the Pyrenees coming up on Thursday. That said, if Monday\u2019s madness tells us anything it\u2019s to take nothing for granted in this bike race. Here\u2019s what William Fotheringham has to say about today\u2019s stage: An amuse-bouche before the serious general classification racing begins, this is a short and probably rapid sprint stage across the south of France with only an early third-category climb to trouble the sprinters. There will be a break, but there are only two more sprint stages after this, so the fastmen will want their teams to control the race.",

He was also convicted under the Goa children\u2019s code for not providing a safe environment for a child, according to MacKeown\u2019s lawyer, Vikram Varma.</p> <p>It is expected that D\u2019Souza will be sentenced on Friday or Saturday, when he could face decades in prison. A second man, Placido Carvalho, accused of abetting a crime, had his acquittal upheld.</p> <p>Scarlett\u2019s bruised and half-naked body was found on the popular Anjuna beach in the north of Goa after a Valentine\u2019s Day beach party.</p> <p>From the start, the police made no effort to properly investigate the case, said MacKeown. She remembers finding Scarlett\u2019s underwear and broken sandals on the beach the day after her murder. \u201cI knew the police had lied to me and not looked for any evidence \u2013 it was right there. I was so shocked, it made the ends of my fingers ache.\u201d</p> <p>Through chance, a woman whose son was friends with Scarlett put MacKeown in touch with Varma. They went from police station to police station on a moped, demanding that the case be treated as a murder investigation.</p> <p>Police initially said Scarlett\u2019s death was an accidental drowning, but MacKeown insisted on a second autopsy.</p> <p>\u201cThey were saying it was an accident. I knew she hadn\u2019t drowned accidentally,\u201d she said. While Varma spoke to the pathologist who had carried out an autopsy, she sneaked in behind them and took photographs of Scarlett\u2019s body \u201cto prove that she had injuries on her because they were denying that\u201d.</p> <p>A later postmortem showed there was ecstasy, cocaine and LSD in the teenager\u2019s body. It also revealed 50 cuts and bruises and evidence of sexual assault. It was alleged that D\u2019Souza plied her with drugs, raped her and left her unconscious face down on the beach.</p> <p>Following D\u2019Souza\u2019s acquittal in 2016 on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/23/scarlett-keeling-goa-judge-clears-men-of-beach-death\">charges of rape and culpable homicide at Goa children\u2019s court</a>, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/09/two-men-in-scarlett-keeling-case-in-india-face-court-again\">it would appeal against the judgment</a>, stating that the judge had not \u201capplied her judicial mind both on points of law and on facts of the case\u201d.</p> <p>The CBI also said the judge had wrongly concluded that there was a delay in recording witness statements.</p> <p>The investigation into Scarlett\u2019s murder was fraught with setbacks including years of delays in India\u2019s sluggish justice system, a change of prosecutor and the failure of a key British witness to testify. Michael Mannion told police he had last seen the schoolgirl hours before, lying in the car park of nearby Lui\u2019s Bar, with local bartender D\u2019Souza lying on top of her, but he did not testify during the trial in 2016<strong>.</strong></p> <p>When Mannion pulled out, MacKeown said she thought it was over. \u201cYou think you\u2019re coping but you\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I look at the pictures of myself coming out of court [on the day the men were acquitted], I look like I\u2019d been slapped.\u201d</p> <p>At every stage of the investigation process, she faced closed doors, she added. It took four and half years for Scarlett\u2019s body to be released because the defendants had the right to an independent pathology report, which they did not take up, said MacKeown.</p> <p>Scarlett\u2019s murder attracted global media attention. The press in Goa was supportive, she said: \u201cThey want the truth at the end of the day.\u201d</p> <p>The UK press, in the beginning, was less so. MacKeown has faced intense scrutiny, including questions over her decision to allow her daughter to travel alone to Anjuna while the family toured further along the coast. \u201cThey\u2019ve been fair to me in most of the last years,\u201d she added.</p> <p>She has had to endure coverage of her daughter\u2019s drug use and sex life, and close scrutiny of her own lifestyle. Scarlett\u2019s death also became the subject of a Bollywood film, which was made without her mother\u2019s consultation.</p> <p>Initially, MacKeown thought the CBI appeal would be over quickly, but it took years. She said she had lost count of the number of trips she had made to Goa, which have left her in substantial debt. Every time she went away, her children worried about what will happen, she added.</p> <p>\u201cThey normalise a lot of stuff that most people shouldn\u2019t have to normalise,\u201d she said of her children. Her seven living children have each moved forwards with their lives, building careers, families and going to university or college.</p> <p>MacKeown said she would continue to support other families who were seeking justice for relatives who had been murdered in Goa, and said she hoped Wednesday\u2019s verdict would hearten them.</p> <p>\u201cI never thought we were going to get this. I never thought this was going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully, it will mean that it\u2019s over now, we won\u2019t have to deal with this as a family now. We can get on.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A man has been convicted in relation to the death of 15-year-old Scarlett Keeling, more than 10 years after she was found dead on a beach in Goa. Fiona MacKeown, Scarlett\u2019s mother, said she was shocked but delighted. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit hard to take it in, that this might actually be the end of it all for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has been traumatic for the children every time I\u2019ve had to go to Goa, and for me, it\u2019s put me into huge debt. It\u2019s been an absolute nightmare for 11 years.\u201d At a hearing on Wednesday, the high court in Goa reversed an earlier acquittal to convict of Samson d\u2019Souza of culpable homicide, criminal assault and outraging a woman\u2019s modesty, providing narcotics to a person with knowledge that it could cause serious harm or death, and destruction of evidence. He was also convicted under the Goa children\u2019s code for not providing a safe environment for a child, according to MacKeown\u2019s lawyer, Vikram Varma. It is expected that D\u2019Souza will be sentenced on Friday or Saturday, when he could face decades in prison. A second man, Placido Carvalho, accused of abetting a crime, had his acquittal upheld. Scarlett\u2019s bruised and half-naked body was found on the popular Anjuna beach in the north of Goa after a Valentine\u2019s Day beach party. From the start, the police made no effort to properly investigate the case, said MacKeown. She remembers finding Scarlett\u2019s underwear and broken sandals on the beach the day after her murder. \u201cI knew the police had lied to me and not looked for any evidence \u2013 it was right there. I was so shocked, it made the ends of my fingers ache.\u201d Through chance, a woman whose son was friends with Scarlett put MacKeown in touch with Varma. They went from police station to police station on a moped, demanding that the case be treated as a murder investigation. Police initially said Scarlett\u2019s death was an accidental drowning, but MacKeown insisted on a second autopsy. \u201cThey were saying it was an accident. I knew she hadn\u2019t drowned accidentally,\u201d she said. While Varma spoke to the pathologist who had carried out an autopsy, she sneaked in behind them and took photographs of Scarlett\u2019s body \u201cto prove that she had injuries on her because they were denying that\u201d. A later postmortem showed there was ecstasy, cocaine and LSD in the teenager\u2019s body. It also revealed 50 cuts and bruises and evidence of sexual assault. It was alleged that D\u2019Souza plied her with drugs, raped her and left her unconscious face down on the beach. Following D\u2019Souza\u2019s acquittal in 2016 on charges of rape and culpable homicide at Goa children\u2019s court, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation announced that it would appeal against the judgment, stating that the judge had not \u201capplied her judicial mind both on points of law and on facts of the case\u201d. The CBI also said the judge had wrongly concluded that there was a delay in recording witness statements. The investigation into Scarlett\u2019s murder was fraught with setbacks including years of delays in India\u2019s sluggish justice system, a change of prosecutor and the failure of a key British witness to testify. Michael Mannion told police he had last seen the schoolgirl hours before, lying in the car park of nearby Lui\u2019s Bar, with local bartender D\u2019Souza lying on top of her, but he did not testify during the trial in 2016. When Mannion pulled out, MacKeown said she thought it was over. \u201cYou think you\u2019re coping but you\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I look at the pictures of myself coming out of court [on the day the men were acquitted], I look like I\u2019d been slapped.\u201d At every stage of the investigation process, she faced closed doors, she added. It took four and half years for Scarlett\u2019s body to be released because the defendants had the right to an independent pathology report, which they did not take up, said MacKeown. Scarlett\u2019s murder attracted global media attention. The press in Goa was supportive, she said: \u201cThey want the truth at the end of the day.\u201d The UK press, in the beginning, was less so. MacKeown has faced intense scrutiny, including questions over her decision to allow her daughter to travel alone to Anjuna while the family toured further along the coast. \u201cThey\u2019ve been fair to me in most of the last years,\u201d she added. She has had to endure coverage of her daughter\u2019s drug use and sex life, and close scrutiny of her own lifestyle. Scarlett\u2019s death also became the subject of a Bollywood film, which was made without her mother\u2019s consultation. Initially, MacKeown thought the CBI appeal would be over quickly, but it took years. She said she had lost count of the number of trips she had made to Goa, which have left her in substantial debt. Every time she went away, her children worried about what will happen, she added. \u201cThey normalise a lot of stuff that most people shouldn\u2019t have to normalise,\u201d she said of her children. Her seven living children have each moved forwards with their lives, building careers, families and going to university or college. MacKeown said she would continue to support other families who were seeking justice for relatives who had been murdered in Goa, and said she hoped Wednesday\u2019s verdict would hearten them. \u201cI never thought we were going to get this. I never thought this was going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully, it will mean that it\u2019s over now, we won\u2019t have to deal with this as a family now. We can get on.\u201d",

Nestled near the Rocky Mountains, it has natural beauty to spare, from lush forests to rolling farm fields \u2013 plus a growing collection of publicly displayed art and innovative architecture within the downtown core. There\u2019s a great NHL team \u2013 the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NTygiM\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calgary Flames</a> \u2013 and every July the city hosts a 10-day party called the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NWfuXZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calgary Stampede</a>, as well as an outstanding <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2O5pDBE\" rel=\"nofollow\">folk music festival</a>.</p> <p>Calgary embodies a rare blend of frontier roots, urban modernity, and has more community spirit than I\u2019ve ever seen. There\u2019s a lot to love here, so what did it take for me to truly appreciate this city?</p> <p>In 2013 Calgary experienced floods of catastrophic proportions. There was an estimated $5bn (CAD) in property damages. Calgary residents took evacuees into their homes and the outpouring of love was phenomenal. Calgary and the surrounding areas were rebuilt, the city suddenly looked better than ever and I felt a change ripple through my community. I knew then that I would never take Calgary for granted again.</p> <p>The best way to experience the city is to start in the centre and work your way out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71d4eb54eea86bd905451a5580ffeb3bcaa998b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d4eb54eea86bd905451a5580ffeb3bcaa998b9/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"The Plaza cinema in Kensington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Plaza cinema in Kensington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cooper &amp; O'Hara/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Plaza cinema in Kensington shows indie gems and cult hits</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Be charmed in Kensington<br></strong>Across the river (and the iconic red Peace Bridge) is the endlessly charming Kensington, which has always been one of my favourite neighbourhoods.

Located along the Bow River, it\u2019s got a fabulous pond for pedal-boating in the summer and ice-skating in the winter, a tea shop, playgrounds, and onsite barbecues. Whether you\u2019re travelling with little ones (who will get a kick out of riding the miniature train through the park) or on a romantic getaway, this is a wonderful place to spend the day.</p> <p><strong>Raft along</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Bow River<br></strong>But to truly experience Calgary like a local, I\u2019d suggest a \u201cBow float\u201d along the river that runs through the city\u2019s heart. Hop in a canoe or raft (you can rent them from various companies, such as <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NWUXmn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lazy Day Raft Rentals</a>) and take to Bow River with the sun on your cheeks and wind in your hair. There are plenty of stop-off points for a sandwich as you make your way downriver, and the longest trip, at roughly three hours, runs from Baker park to Prince\u2019s Island park.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccc941142490a1752b843b8831447eab831e00c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccc941142490a1752b843b8831447eab831e00c8/3_0_1393_836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bow River flows through the heart of the city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bow River flows through the heart of the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cooper &amp; O'Hara/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1bfa20f06806034c7fc6a1a0016a5aa01f49586b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfa20f06806034c7fc6a1a0016a5aa01f49586b/0_0_2310_1106/1000.png\" alt=\"Bridgeland and the Central Library in East Village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"479\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bridgeland and the Central Library in East Village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cooper &amp; O'Hara/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Bow River flows through the heart of the city; to the north is Bridgeland (left) with East Village, home of the Central Library (right), to the south</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Elbow Falls/Bragg Creek<br></strong>If you jump in a car and hit the road to the Rocky Mountains, within 45 minutes you\u2019ll be at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2LYGqnp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elbow Falls</a>. It takes its name from a couple of small but mighty waterfalls and is a great destination for outdoorsy types of all levels. Elbow Falls also provides perfect fodder for budding and professional photographers alike.</p> <p>Bragg Creek is an adorable hamlet that\u2019s great for a stop on your way to or from Elbow Falls. There\u2019s a row of shops that includes restaurants serving comfort foods, an ice-cream and candy shop that just might have every sweet treat imaginable, and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2NVO7O0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spirits West</a> \u2013 where wines are organised according to flavour and mood, rather than country.</p> <p><strong>Hike</strong> <strong>Canmore and Grassi Lakes<br></strong>Banff gets a lot of well-deserved attention from residents and tourists alike and is definitely worth checking out. That said, I often opt to stay in Canmore, where you\u2019ll find some great hotel options (I recommend <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2Sew57U\" rel=\"nofollow\">Solara Resort &amp; Spa</a>), as well as local craft breweries and innovative restaurants. The standout activity in Canmore is the hike up to Grassi Lakes. You\u2019re given the option of taking the easy trail or the hard trail upon arrival. The latter offers incredible views, while the former is nice for those with limited mobility. At the top, be prepared to be stunned when you gaze over the Rockies from the summit. But the best views are still to come when you reach the actual Grassi Lakes, which are aquamarine and so clear it\u2019s like looking through glass. Their beauty may just render you speechless.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"fcfe0cad865b218c60a79c1338f183dd4dded851\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcfe0cad865b218c60a79c1338f183dd4dded851/0_0_4291_5363/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Grassi Lakes near Canmore.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grassi Lakes near Canmore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cooper &amp; O'Hara/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"dd0584a305fbb6fccc237b17eeb6bb4af79d31a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0584a305fbb6fccc237b17eeb6bb4af79d31a7/0_0_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking to the Grassi Lakes.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hiking to the Grassi Lakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cooper &amp; O\u2019Hara</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3aec6456da3725b1dd1fccc2bb65c36d27a0b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3aec6456da3725b1dd1fccc2bb65c36d27a0b45/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The path through the forest to the Grassi Lakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The path through the forest to the Grassi Lakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cooper &amp; O\u2019Hara/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The Grassi Lakes are reached on foot; there are easy or hard trails</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>The markets and artists of Calgary<br></strong>Calgary has myriad markets and fairs to enjoy \u2013 it\u2019s a city that values creativity.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s definitely a lot to love about Calgary. For a start, it was ranked the world\u2019s fourth most livable city by the Economist last year. Nestled near the Rocky Mountains, it has natural beauty to spare, from lush forests to rolling farm fields \u2013 plus a growing collection of publicly displayed art and innovative architecture within the downtown core. There\u2019s a great NHL team \u2013 the Calgary Flames \u2013 and every July the city hosts a 10-day party called the Calgary Stampede, as well as an outstanding folk music festival. Calgary embodies a rare blend of frontier roots, urban modernity, and has more community spirit than I\u2019ve ever seen. There\u2019s a lot to love here, so what did it take for me to truly appreciate this city? In 2013 Calgary experienced floods of catastrophic proportions. There was an estimated $5bn (CAD) in property damages. Calgary residents took evacuees into their homes and the outpouring of love was phenomenal. Calgary and the surrounding areas were rebuilt, the city suddenly looked better than ever and I felt a change ripple through my community. I knew then that I would never take Calgary for granted again. The best way to experience the city is to start in the centre and work your way out. The Plaza cinema in Kensington shows indie gems and cult hits Be charmed in Kensington Across the river (and the iconic red Peace Bridge) is the endlessly charming Kensington, which has always been one of my favourite neighbourhoods. There\u2019s a historic movie theatre called the Plaza, which shows everything you won\u2019t see in mainstream theatres, from indie gems to older cult hits. Rows of cool shops line the streets. Hit up Hot Wax Records for new and used vinyl, or check out Kismet Clothing for an updated ensemble. Miss your furry friend back home? Go to the Regal Cat Cafe to snuggle some kitties. If you come to Kensington hungry, I highly recommend checking out Hayden Block Smoke &amp; Whiskey for mouthwatering barbecue and cocktails, or popping into Niko\u2019s Bistro for fresh pasta in an intimate atmosphere. Here, Niko \u2013 who came to Calgary from Croatia \u2013 is likely to applaud you for ordering and eating two main courses (not that I\u2019m speaking from experience. Except I\u2019m definitely speaking from experience). Niko\u2019s Bistro (top); Hayden Block Smoke &amp; Whiskey Visit a food truck As well as great restaurants, like a lot of cities, some of the best food you\u2019ll taste here comes from a food truck. Want to find them? Download the YYCFoodTrucks app to see who\u2019s out and where, like you\u2019re a local in the know. Travelling from downtown to the outskirts of the city, the trucks tend to move around daily, but are all well represented on social media and easy to find on the app map. Eat like a local from one of the city\u2019s many food trucks Get spooked in Inglewood Calgary\u2019s original main street, now the historic neighbourhood of Inglewood, has managed to keep its charm. This quirky area somehow manages to be downtown and hidden from downtown all at once. Grab a cup of the smoothest coffee you\u2019ll ever taste at local roasters Rosso, then search for hidden gems in one of the vintage shops. If you\u2019re curious about the occult, you shouldn\u2019t miss the Inglewood Ghost Tour. A cape-wearing guide will lead you through the streets and give you a taste of Calgary\u2019s spookier history. Do I believe in ghosts? No. Am I afraid of ghosts? Absolutely. The Inglewood area of the city; grab a coffee at Rosso A day out in Bowness park Bowness park is a beautiful area that\u2019s easy to miss if you don\u2019t know where to look. Located along the Bow River, it\u2019s got a fabulous pond for pedal-boating in the summer and ice-skating in the winter, a tea shop, playgrounds, and onsite barbecues. Whether you\u2019re travelling with little ones (who will get a kick out of riding the miniature train through the park) or on a romantic getaway, this is a wonderful place to spend the day. Raft along the Bow River But to truly experience Calgary like a local, I\u2019d suggest a \u201cBow float\u201d along the river that runs through the city\u2019s heart. Hop in a canoe or raft (you can rent them from various companies, such as Lazy Day Raft Rentals) and take to Bow River with the sun on your cheeks and wind in your hair. There are plenty of stop-off points for a sandwich as you make your way downriver, and the longest trip, at roughly three hours, runs from Baker park to Prince\u2019s Island park. The Bow River flows through the heart of the city; to the north is Bridgeland (left) with East Village, home of the Central Library (right), to the south Elbow Falls/Bragg Creek If you jump in a car and hit the road to the Rocky Mountains, within 45 minutes you\u2019ll be at Elbow Falls. It takes its name from a couple of small but mighty waterfalls and is a great destination for outdoorsy types of all levels. Elbow Falls also provides perfect fodder for budding and professional photographers alike. Bragg Creek is an adorable hamlet that\u2019s great for a stop on your way to or from Elbow Falls. There\u2019s a row of shops that includes restaurants serving comfort foods, an ice-cream and candy shop that just might have every sweet treat imaginable, and Spirits West \u2013 where wines are organised according to flavour and mood, rather than country. Hike Canmore and Grassi Lakes Banff gets a lot of well-deserved attention from residents and tourists alike and is definitely worth checking out. That said, I often opt to stay in Canmore, where you\u2019ll find some great hotel options (I recommend Solara Resort &amp; Spa), as well as local craft breweries and innovative restaurants. The standout activity in Canmore is the hike up to Grassi Lakes. You\u2019re given the option of taking the easy trail or the hard trail upon arrival. The latter offers incredible views, while the former is nice for those with limited mobility. At the top, be prepared to be stunned when you gaze over the Rockies from the summit. But the best views are still to come when you reach the actual Grassi Lakes, which are aquamarine and so clear it\u2019s like looking through glass. Their beauty may just render you speechless. The Grassi Lakes are reached on foot; there are easy or hard trails The markets and artists of Calgary Calgary has myriad markets and fairs to enjoy \u2013 it\u2019s a city that values creativity. One of the most exciting platforms for our community of artists comes in the form of the Market Collective, which has weekend events throughout the summer at the St Louis hotel in East Village. I nearly went bankrupt at the last market I attended, snatching up candles, beauty products, jewellery, and baked goods (I\u2019m still having dreams about flavoured cream puffs and elderflower soda). It\u2019s a family-friendly affair that can include food trucks, bouncy castles, a miniature skateboard park, and live music.

GRIMES: My training is a 360 approach. I first maintain a healthy cellular routine where I maximize the function of my mitochondria with supplements such as NAD+, Acetyl L-Carnitine, Magnesium, etc. This helps promote ATP and it\u2019s incredibly visceral. From that point I spend 2-4 hours in my deprivation tank, this allows me to \u201castro-glide\u201d to other dimensions - past, present, and future.  In the afternoons I do a 1-2 hour sword fighting session with my trainer, James Lew, we go over the fundamentals that work the obliques, core stabilizes, and triceps as well as a few tricks. To wind down from this I spend 30-45 minutes on an inclined hike at roughly 4-4.5 miles per hour, arguably the most efficient workout. I then spend 45 minutes stretching before heading into the studio where my mind and body are functioning at peak level, with a neuroplastic goal between 57.5 and 71.5 AphC\u2019s (which is my preferred range for my blood type). I\u2019ve outfitted my studio with the highest grade of red light. It is pretty much 1000 sqf IR Sauna.  Hana then comes over and we do a screaming session for 20-25 minutes while I slow boil the honey tea that maximizes vocal proficiency. I have also eliminated all blue light from my vision through an experimental surgery that removes the top film of my eyeball and replaces it with an orange ultra-flex polymer that my friend and I made in the lab this past winter as a means to cure seasonal depression. I go to bed with a humidifier on. #asmc #adidasparley #createdwithadidas  #gentrifymordor</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/grimes/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> MISS ANTHROPOCENE</a> (@grimes) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-07-15T23:33:09+00:00\">Jul 15, 2019 at 4:33pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p><strong>OK.</strong> Grimes went on: \u201cFrom that point I spend two to four hours in my deprivation tank, this allows me to \u2018astro-glide\u2019 to other dimensions \u2013 past, present, and future.\u201d</p> <p><strong>It certainly makes for a full morning. </strong>\u201cIn the afternoons, I do a one to two-hour sword-fighting session with my trainer,\u201d she said.

It\u2019s a story that would leave most of us shaking our heads at the sheer state of things. But for Panjabi, a gauntlet was thrown down. \u201cIt made me realise how hard it would be,\u201d she recalls. A decade on from that advice, she is in London to promote her latest star-studded show, Departure, in which her ethnicity is as irrelevant as her stellar Hollywood status is germane. </p> <p>Panjabi\u2019s fans, of course, won\u2019t be surprised. The actor has a 25-year-long, Atlantic-spanning film and TV career under her belt, as well as a reputation for philanthropic clout. She <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographicpartners.com/press/2017/12/uk-guest-editors-magazine/\">guest-edited</a> last year\u2019s special race issue of the UK National Geographic; she\u2019s been consistently vocal about women\u2019s rights, working on everything from Amnesty International\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.au/stop-violence-women/\">Stop Violence Against Women</a> campaign to the <a href=\"https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/tentimesten/\">10x10 project to promote education for girls</a>.

      "bodyText": "It says a lot about British actor Archie Panjabi that the best piece of advice she says she ever received was when an Indian agent told her that an Indian woman would never make it in Hollywood. It\u2019s a story that would leave most of us shaking our heads at the sheer state of things. But for Panjabi, a gauntlet was thrown down. \u201cIt made me realise how hard it would be,\u201d she recalls. A decade on from that advice, she is in London to promote her latest star-studded show, Departure, in which her ethnicity is as irrelevant as her stellar Hollywood status is germane. Panjabi\u2019s fans, of course, won\u2019t be surprised. The actor has a 25-year-long, Atlantic-spanning film and TV career under her belt, as well as a reputation for philanthropic clout. She guest-edited last year\u2019s special race issue of the UK National Geographic; she\u2019s been consistently vocal about women\u2019s rights, working on everything from Amnesty International\u2019s Stop Violence Against Women campaign to the 10x10 project to promote education for girls. While she is more effusive and gentle in person than most of the roles she\u2019s famous for would suggest (at one point her PR sneezes during our interview; she\u2019s instantly asking if he\u2019s ok, offering him a drink, handing out throat lozenges \u2026), you sense she\u2019s as tough as any of the characters she\u2019s portrayed. Of course some characters stay with you more than others. For many people, Panjabi will always be Kalinda Sharma, the scene-stealing private investigator she played on The Good Wife. Tight-lipped, fiercely loyal and utterly ruthless in her red leather biker gear, Kalinda trampled all over a multitude of stereotypes (racial, female, professional) to become one of TV\u2019s most enigmatic and memorable figures. It\u2019s odd, then, that not 12 minutes into Departure, Panjabi appears on screen as \u2026 a tight-lipped private investigator in red leather biker gear. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know it was spotted,\u201d says Panjabi when I mention this nod to her former character.

      "bodyText": "EU nations are to be vetted annually on their adherence to the rule of law, in a renewed attempt from Brussels to stop governments from firing independent judges and packing courts with pliable supporters. In an effort to stop democratic backsliding, all EU countries will be subject to annual monitoring on the rule of law, the European commission announced on Wednesday, one day after its incoming president, Ursula von der Leyen, sought to assuage critics of her appointment with a pledge to uphold democratic values. Elected with a wafer-thin majority, Von der Leyen, said she fully supported an \u201cEU-wide rule-of-law mechanism\u201d, as she sought to tackle accusations she would be beholden to nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary that supported her surprise elevation to the top job. Details on that rule-of-law mechanism were spelt out in a policy paper published on Wednesday by the commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, who has repeatedly clashed with Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party over its judicial changes. Hungary is also facing the EU\u2019s most serious disciplinary procedure since the European parliament declared a \u201csystematic threat\u201d to the rule of law in 2018, although the process has languished in the EU\u2019s council of ministers. Timmermans announced the commission would publish an annual rule-of-law report, which would cover all member states to help detect \u201cemerging rule-of-law problems wherever they appear\u201d. Germany and Belgium made a similar proposal in March, in order to counter the accusation that central and eastern European countries were being unfairly targeted. \u201cThe EU\u2019s role in this area must be objective and treat all member states alike,\u201d says the paper that will be discussed by EU ministers on Thursday. The commission is embroiled in an unprecedented legal battle with Poland over the integrity of Polish courts, which led to last month\u2019s landmark European court of justice ruling that Warsaw\u2019s decision to lower the retirement age of judges was unlawful. Since coming to power in 2015, Law and Justice has argued that far-reaching changes to the judiciary are required to remove judges who served during the communist era. In a separate move, the commission announced the next step in another legal case against Poland on a law that allows judges to be subject to disciplinary charges over their rulings, a measure denounced as having a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on judicial independence. The commission said on Wednesday it would take the Polish government to court if Warsaw did not act to change the disciplinary regime within two months. That deadline falls before the arrival of Von der Leyen, who is scheduled to take office on 1 November. The first-ever female commission president was criticised by some Socialists and Greens, who claimed she would be a weak defender of the rule of law. Law and Justice\u2019s backing of Von der Leyen\u2019s nomination fanned that idea, with the party\u2019s official Twitter account quoting the Polish prime minster, Mateusz Morawiecki, describing her as a good candidate to work out compromises. An EU source said the strengthened approach had been embraced by Von der Leyen, adding: \u201cIf anything we are trying to tighten the net, not make it looser.\u201d Von der Leyen told MEPs that the commission would \u201calways be an independent guardian of the treaties. Lady Justice is blind \u2013 she will defend the rule of law wherever it is attacked.\u201d She emerged as a compromise candidate after Poland and Hungary led opposition to Timmermans, a Dutch socialist, who ran in a pan-European campaign to replace Jean-Claude Juncker. In a statement Timmermans said the rule of law had \u201ccome under attack in several ways\u201d in the past five years, without naming specific countries. \u201cThe European commission has been fighting hard to resist these attacks with the tools available to us, and will continue to do so.

This is not social realism in the style of Ken Loach, but it is a film with a strong sense of outrage. Some might find it relentlessly bleak. \u2022 Gwen is released in the UK on 19 July.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s unusual connection with the UK public first became obvious to the Labour Brexiter Gisela Stuart in May 2016 when they arrived in Cornwall on a major Vote Leave campaign event. Surrounded by a media scrum, the backbench MPs descended together from the infamous red Vote Leave bus \u2013 adorned with a pledge to spend \u00a3350m a week on a post-Brexit NHS \u2013 and were handed top-heavy soft vanilla scoops on thin wafer cones. As they struggled through local traders and well wishers shouting the word \u201cBoris\u201d, they both realised that the ice creams were melting on a warm spring day quicker than they could be consumed. \u201cAll I could think was \u2018this is going to start dripping everywhere but it won\u2019t look good if we throw them away\u2019,\u201d said Stuart, who was then the chair of the Vote Leave campaign. At that moment, a mature, well dressed woman walked out of the crowd and headed for Johnson. \u201cThis lady said \u2018Mr Johnson, may I eat the rest of your ice cream for you?\u2019,\u201d said Stuart. Johnson handed the ice cream over and she devoured it. Stuart, who campaigned with Tony Blair in 1997, said that kind of impromptu, giddy exchange was replicated over the six weeks of the campaign. He was an invaluable asset to Vote Leave, she said. \u201cHow often have you seen a member of the public thrilled to be eating a politician\u2019s half-eaten ice cream, and a politician so at ease that he would hand it over?\u201d she said. A Daily Telegraph newspaper columnist and former Spectator editor, Johnson was seen as a vote winner among Tory activists after retaining the mayoralty of London, traditionally a Labour-leaning city. He had returned to the backbenches as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip to search for a top job in government and was seen by many as a leader in waiting. Fellow senior figures in the Vote Leave campaign said they had priced in Johnson\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 that he could attract widespread condemnation for offensive gaffes and that he might struggle with detail. It caused concern in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters \u2013 but little shock \u2013 when four days after that visit to Cornwall, Johnson gave an interview in which he compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. \u201cNapoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods,\u201d Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph. Holocaust victims and war heroes stepped forward to condemn him. Asked about the damage from this particular comparison, Bavarian-born Stuart paused, and then replied: \u201cI have a long-standing piece of advice to politicians of all backgrounds \u2013 keep your references to the Third Reich to between 1939 and 45. They rarely listen to my advice. \u201d Perhaps Johnson\u2019s most controversial comments came a month earlier, when he wrote in a Daily Telegraph column that Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d heritage had driven him towards anti-British sentiment. Following a plea from the then US president for the UK to stay in the EU, Johnson wrote that Obama had removed a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office \u2013 a claim which had already been debunked by the Washington Post. Regardless of the facts, Johnson wrote: \u201cSome said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president\u2019s ancestral dislike of the British empire \u2013 of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender.\u201d Did such comments upset those in Vote Leave? Not really, according to one source who worked with him during the referendum campaign. \u201cJohnson is expected to make risqu\u00e9 remarks from a bygone era. It probably helped to highlight the fact that we were ready face down our allies \u2013 not a bad position when you are arguing for sovereignty,\u201d the source said. A former confidante of Johnson said he was aware that he could get away with insults and borderline racist comments. \u201cThe bonhomie, the sub-PG Wodehouse schtick, the Have I Got News For You appearances, they have given him a protective force field. Otherwise unpalatable ideas that would kill off a fledgling political career can be discussed. He knows it,\u201d the former colleague said. Johnson\u2019s decision in February 2016 to campaign against his Eton school chum and rival David Cameron and back the campaign to leave was carefully calculated with an eye on a possible future move to become prime minister, one former aide said. \u201cHe knew that either way, campaigning to leave would give him the support that a leader needs across the party\u2019s members,\u201d one Tory adviser said. Having argued in favour of reforming the EU for many years while also being critical of its impositions on UK sovereignty, Johnson drew up three separate articles for his weekly Daily Telegraph column \u2013 two arguing to leave, and another to remain in the EU. His remain article, which was later uncovered by the Sunday Times, concluded: \u201cThis is a market on our doorstep, ready for further exploitation by British firms. The membership fee seems rather small for all that access. Why are we so determined to turn our backs on it?\u201d Disclosure of the contradictory articles changed Cameron\u2019s supporters\u2019 views on Johnson. \u201cBefore, his decision to campaign to leave was seen as an act that was at least in part rooted in principle. After the remain article was uncovered, his decision was viewed as a cynical ploy to reach No 10. Grubby,\u201d said one. It was one of the leave articles that was published in the Daily Telegraph hours after Johnson had left his home in Islington, north London to declare that he was going to support exiting the EU. Johnson\u2019s decision to campaign to leave the EU rattled Cameron. The following day, the then prime minister released a statement to parliament saying \u201cI have no other agenda than what is good for my country\u201d, which was widely interpreted as a criticism of Johnson\u2019s ambition. Tensions between the two former Bullingdon Club members heightened again over the kind of relationship the UK could have with the EU after Brexit. Cameron ridiculed Johnson\u2019s recent conversion to a Canada-style Brexit model having previously been in favour of a Norway-style deal in which the UK would still pay money to the EU. \u201cThey [the Vote Leave campaign] are literally making it up as they go along,\u201d the then prime minister said. \u201cThey are rolling the dice, they are taking a risk and they are taking a risk with people\u2019s jobs, taking a risk with families\u2019 finances.\u201d One of the problems facing Cameron and the official Stronger In campaign was Johnson\u2019s untouchability in the eyes of the public. Focus groups showed that he was not judged on the same criteria as other politicians, particularly among undecided voters. According to Ryan Coetzee, the director of strategy for the campaign to remain in the EU, Johnson was judged \u201cas a celebrity, not a leader\u201d \u2013 a clever, ambitious actor. \u201cSome take him seriously, some don\u2019t but all of them discount his blunders and gaffs [sic] with \u2018But that\u2019s Boris\u2019. He\u2019s seen as fake but cleverly so,\u201d Coetzee wrote in a memo to staff in May 2016. On the morning of 24 June, after the referendum result had become clear, Cameron dramatically resigned in front of cameras in Downing Street, sparking a leadership race in which Johnson was the clear favourite. An hour later, Johnson appeared at a news conference in Vote Leave\u2019s offices across the river from the Houses of Parliament. Johnson looked pale and stunned as he attempted to reassure the markets with a sombre speech. \u201cI believe the British people have spoken up for democracy in Britain and across Europe and we can be proud of the result,\u201d he said. Those who worked with him on the campaign say he played a crucial role in the victory, a role which was very much front of house \u2013 at press conferences, campaign events and TV debates. Gisela Stuart, who partnered Johnson in ITN\u2019s EU television debate vs Amber Rudd, Angela Eagle and Nicola Sturgeon, said: \u201cOnce you had him in the room preparing for this debate he totally and utterly engaged with the task in hand. There was no hint of a prima donna.\u201d Doubts remain over whether Johnson is willing or able to involve himself in detailed discussions around policy and strategy. Insiders said that he very rarely contributed in the office, happy to leave those conversations to the likes of Michael Gove, Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings. Critics from his own party believe his failure to get involved in the detail reinforces suspicions that he is incapable of serious political interventions. Sir Alan Duncan, the foreign office minister and a noted critic of Johnson, told the Guardian: \u201cIt does appear that he is happiest when he is hanging on a zip wire of some sort, waving little flags, while others do the real work.\u201d",

The likely prime minister\u2019s pro-EU market sympathies were said to be revealed in a letter of condolence to the wife of the late Tory politician Sir Leon Brittan, who died in January 2015. An account of the letter, shared with the Guardian, underscores Johnson\u2019s lifelong equivocation over Britain\u2019s EU membership. After feverish speculation, the Tory grassroots favourite declared for leave in February 2016, having wrestled with the question in separate articles, two making the case for Brexit, the third for remain. His letter of tribute to Brittan was read aloud at a memorial service in May 2015, attended by political grandees including Ken Clarke and Nick Clegg.

In the Tory leadership race, Johnson has portrayed himself as a champion of Brexit, saying the UK must leave, \u201cdo or die\u201d, by 31 October.

Sweeper! and Defender! Read by few at the time but now increasingly expensive and difficult to find as collectors\u2019 items, they have become the The Gutenberg Bibles of noir football fiction. \u201cI looked around the stadium and sighed,\u201d whispers crime-fighting Leddersfield Town manager Steve Barnes, looking around the stadium and sighing, in one of them. \u201cFootball is a business, and a tough one at that, but the green playing area, well, that really is the field of dreams.\u201d<em> </em>Well, if Barnes thought solving the murder of his club\u2019s groundsman was tricky and full of pitfalls, his author ego has now been tasked with the much more difficult job of dealing with what is increasingly viewed as a field of nightmares by those who sit on all four sides of it.</p> <p>Picked by Mike Ashley to stumble around in the size 19s recently vacated by Rafa Ben\u00edtez, it was announced early on Wednesday that Bruce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jul/17/steve-bruce-newcastle-united-paul-wilson\">is the new manager of Newcastle United</a>. An appointment that has been greeted with no great surprise but a huge amount of disappointment, it was certainly not the exciting new dawn fans were hoping for a couple of months ago, when excitable chatter on Tyneside centred on an Arab takeover that turned out to be even less plausible than the preposterous plots of Bruce\u2019s trilogy of books. \u201cI\u2019m delighted and incredibly proud to be appointed,\u201d trousered Bruce, fresh from lending his name to yet another ream of paper in the form of a three-year contract. \u201cThis is my boyhood club and it was my dad\u2019s club, so this is a very special moment for me and my family. There is a huge challenge ahead of us, but it\u2019s one that my staff and I are ready for.

      "bodyText": "MANAGER! During his second stint in management as boss of Huddersfield Town, Steve Bruce somehow found time to author three crime thrillers entitled Striker! Sweeper! and Defender! Read by few at the time but now increasingly expensive and difficult to find as collectors\u2019 items, they have become the The Gutenberg Bibles of noir football fiction. \u201cI looked around the stadium and sighed,\u201d whispers crime-fighting Leddersfield Town manager Steve Barnes, looking around the stadium and sighing, in one of them. \u201cFootball is a business, and a tough one at that, but the green playing area, well, that really is the field of dreams.\u201d Well, if Barnes thought solving the murder of his club\u2019s groundsman was tricky and full of pitfalls, his author ego has now been tasked with the much more difficult job of dealing with what is increasingly viewed as a field of nightmares by those who sit on all four sides of it. Picked by Mike Ashley to stumble around in the size 19s recently vacated by Rafa Ben\u00edtez, it was announced early on Wednesday that Bruce is the new manager of Newcastle United. An appointment that has been greeted with no great surprise but a huge amount of disappointment, it was certainly not the exciting new dawn fans were hoping for a couple of months ago, when excitable chatter on Tyneside centred on an Arab takeover that turned out to be even less plausible than the preposterous plots of Bruce\u2019s trilogy of books. \u201cI\u2019m delighted and incredibly proud to be appointed,\u201d trousered Bruce, fresh from lending his name to yet another ream of paper in the form of a three-year contract. \u201cThis is my boyhood club and it was my dad\u2019s club, so this is a very special moment for me and my family. There is a huge challenge ahead of us, but it\u2019s one that my staff and I are ready for. We\u2019ll roll our sleeves up and we\u2019ll be giving it everything from the off to ensure supporters have a successful team that they can be proud of.\u201d Describing their new manager as Ashley\u2019s \u201clatest stooge\u201d, Newcastle fan website True Faith was predictably enthused by his arrival from Sheffield Wednesday for compensation believed to be in the region of \u00a34m, not that the Owls are best pleased. \u201cBruce\u2019s imminent appointment will not set the pulses racing, instil any confidence or more importantly get the punters through the turnstiles,\u201d it groaned. \u201cA line appears to have been crossed now.\u201d If so, it is the latest in a long line of them to have been traversed during what passes for Ashley\u2019s stewardship. The multi-billionaire continues to step over them with impunity because those who want him gone evidently don\u2019t desire his departure badly enough to do anything that might actually hasten it. \u201cSteve knows what this club means to supporters and to the region and he will put his heart and soul into leading our talented group of players with the full support of our staff,\u201d cheered senior suit Lee Charnley, with a commendably straight face. \u201cThe hard work for Steve and his team starts immediately and we will be fully prepared for the challenge of a new Premier League season.\u201d Another line, this time drawn, albeit a very blurred one between half-truth and fiction. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThis is the respect that people have for women\u2019s football in Brazil. Goodnight to everyone who\u2019s going to sleep quietly in their own beds before working the next day\u201d \u2013 Santos manager Emily Lima rips into the Brazilian Football Confederation after her players were forced to spend part of the night in a hotel lobby as they prepared for a crucial league match against Iranduba. FIVER LETTERS \u201cBury FC update: despite the departure of the entire promotion-winning squad from last season, fears of a failure to field a team in the opening pre-season fixture at Nantwich Town over the weekend were unfounded. Perhaps Bury-born Danny Boyle can set his next film in a world where nobody remembers the fit and proper person test?\u201d \u2013 Darrien Bold. \u201cDelighted to see that popular hit comedy, Newcastle United, has been renewed for another season. With cuddly Bernard Cribbins all set to roll over and have his belly rubbed in the Premier League again, you can be sure the ratings will go through the roof. Hats off to the Magpies for upping the ante on fellow north-east sitcom, Sunderland FC, after their critically acclaimed slapstick ending to last season. How the Black Cats will respond is anyone\u2019s guess. Perhaps an elaborate plot twist with a not-dead Jimmy Nail coming out of the shower at the end?\u201d \u2013 Johnny Connelly. \u201cGoogling HHAGTFABM (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) now results in two links to The Fiver. One for the original reference and one for yesterday\u2019s reference, which kindly highlighted the single search result phenomenon, but in doing so rendered the letter pointless\u201d \u2013 David Harwood [make that three, etc and so on \u2013 Fiver Ed].

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Fleetwood boss Joey Barton has been charged with causing actual bodily harm after Barnsley manager Daniel Stendel was left with facial injuries following a tunnel fracas at Oakwell. Stevenage have been fined \u00a35,000 after admitting an FA charge of sexist chanting towards a female official during a home game in March. \u201cWe will impose significant bans on any supporters found guilty of such behaviour,\u201d said chief suit Phil Wallace. West Ham are \u00a345m lighter in the pocket after signing Eintracht Frankfurt striker S\u00e9bastien Haller, which seems like a lot of beans. \u201c[The] Premier League ain\u2019t ready,\u201d tweeted the Bundesliga, which could mean absolutely anything.

What they would really like is to bypass the Europa League altogether and reach the Champions League direct but so would Manchester United and Arsenal and they have more resources. While Everton fans can be impressed by some of the names Silva is being linked with \u2013 Mario Mandzukic, Diego Costa and Moise Kean, for instance \u2013 the tricky bit is persuading anyone of that stature to hook up with a team whose Champions League record is negligible and with qualification status patchy even in the Europa League.</p> <p>But at least Everton are trying. Silva\u2019s team did not completely win over the doubters on the pitch last season, but the manager is having a decent transfer window and excitement is already building. This is no small achievement when living in the same city as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, having seen the neighbours reach two Champions League finals in the last couple of seasons while watching first Burnley then Wolves claim the seventh spot they had come to regard as their own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/13/premier-league-transfers-club-by-club-guide\">Premier League transfers so far this summer and what each club still needs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Liverpool completed that ludicrous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">comeback against Barcelona at Anfield</a> there was talk among Everton supporters of building an ark, both a refuge and an escape being considered necessary if a sixth red conquest of Europe was now on the cards, but the great thing about football is that everything settles down again after summer and everyone starts the new season with a clean slate.</p> <p>As Delph has just explained, in the most naked attempt to press Everton buttons since David Moyes came up with his \u201cpeople\u2019s club\u201d routine, there is always a good deal of passion at Goodison.

Just about the only way to make the Europa League pay is to go all the way and win the thing, thereby earning a Champions League place, but though Manchester United and Chelsea might be equipped to do that, mid-table sides not blessed with Champions League-sized squads or resources find it difficult to keep making progress on two fronts for the greater part of the season. Burnley were a case in point last season, when their reward for a tremendous seventh-place finish the season before was a relegation scare in the next campaign. Sean Dyche said it took them until Christmas to get the extra exertion of the Europa League out of their system yet their European odyssey lasted only until the end of August. Everton at the moment have no European football on offer, which does not make it any easier to sign the sort of reliable striker whose goals will help achieve European football in future. What they would really like is to bypass the Europa League altogether and reach the Champions League direct but so would Manchester United and Arsenal and they have more resources. While Everton fans can be impressed by some of the names Silva is being linked with \u2013 Mario Mandzukic, Diego Costa and Moise Kean, for instance \u2013 the tricky bit is persuading anyone of that stature to hook up with a team whose Champions League record is negligible and with qualification status patchy even in the Europa League. But at least Everton are trying. Silva\u2019s team did not completely win over the doubters on the pitch last season, but the manager is having a decent transfer window and excitement is already building. This is no small achievement when living in the same city as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, having seen the neighbours reach two Champions League finals in the last couple of seasons while watching first Burnley then Wolves claim the seventh spot they had come to regard as their own. When Liverpool completed that ludicrous comeback against Barcelona at Anfield there was talk among Everton supporters of building an ark, both a refuge and an escape being considered necessary if a sixth red conquest of Europe was now on the cards, but the great thing about football is that everything settles down again after summer and everyone starts the new season with a clean slate. As Delph has just explained, in the most naked attempt to press Everton buttons since David Moyes came up with his \u201cpeople\u2019s club\u201d routine, there is always a good deal of passion at Goodison. It is encouraging to see the present management have no intention of taking it for granted.",

China\u2019s decision to ban foreign plastic waste imports last year threw global recycling into chaos, leaving developed nations struggling to find countries to send their trash. Eighty-three shipping containers full of rubbish were found on Tuesday at Sihanoukville, Cambodia\u2019s main port, according to a spokesman for the country\u2019s environment minister. \u201cCambodia is not a dustbin where foreign countries can dispose of out-of-date e-waste, and the government also opposes any import of plastic waste and lubricants to be recycled in this country,\u201d he said. Neth Pheaktra said 70 of the containers were shipped from the US and 13 came from Canada. Both countries are major exporters of such waste. A government committee established to look into the matter will investigate how and why the containers ended up in Cambodia, he said. He added that any company found to be involved in bringing in the waste would be fined and brought to court. Images of officials inspecting the containers, stuffed with bundled plastic, riled up Cambodian social media users. The trash delivery was a \u201cserious insult\u201d, Transparency International Cambodia\u2019s executive director, Preap Kol, said in a Facebook post. Tuesday\u2019s discovery followed a statement at a cabinet meeting last week by the prime minister, Hun Sen, that Cambodia is not the dumping ground for any kind of waste, and does not allow the import of any kinds of plastic waste or other recyclables. Cambodia also has a severe problem with plastic waste it generates domestically, with little public awareness of the problem or infrastructure to deal with it. Huge quantities of rubbish have wound up on south-east Asian shores as opposition to handling exported trash is growing in the region. Indonesia announced this month it was sending back dozens of containers full of waste to France, Australia and other developed nations, while neighbouring Malaysia said in May it was shipping 450 tonnes of imported plastic waste back to its sources. Around 300m tonnes of plastic are produced every year, according to the WorldWide Fund for Nature (WWF), with much of it ending up in landfills or polluting the seas in what has become a growing international crisis. In May, 187 countries signed a treaty giving nations the power to block the import of contaminated or hard to recycle plastic trash. A few countries did not sign. One was the US.",

In a sort of literary European Union, he was influenced by three literary heroes: the Belgian Georges Simenon, creator of Inspector Maigret; Leonardo Sciascia, author of The Day of the Owl, who was a native of Sicily like Camilleri; and the Spanish writer Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n.</p> <p>First met by Italian readers in <em>La forma dell\u2019acqua </em>in 1994<em> (</em>in English as<em> </em>The Shape of Water in 2002), Camilleri\u2019s cop, Commissario Salvo Montalbano shared many traits with his creator: a Sicilian with a love of literature, cigarettes and food. As in Montalb\u00e1n\u2019s Inspector Pepe Carvalho books, Montalbano \u2013 named in homage to the Spanish novelist \u2013 uses delicious cuisine as a counterweight to his deathly profession. Eating, Camilleri liked to say, is one of the greatest pleasures the dead surrender.</p> <p>After his delayed start in the mystery form, Camilleri wrote fast. Their sales accelerated by an atmospheric TV series (seen on BBC4 in the UK and SBS in Australia), 27 Montalbano novels have been published in Italy to date. The 24th will make it to English this September, when The Other End of the Line will be published.</p> <p>That book starts with Montalbano dealing with a huge group of political refugees arriving on the Sicilian coast \u2013 a characteristic topicality in a series of novels that have followed Italy into the eras of the euro, the contentious governments of Silvio Berlusconi (to whom Camilleri was strongly opposed), and Euroscepticism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/06/andrea-camilleri-montalbano-life-in-writing\">Andrea Camilleri: a life in writing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn many crime novels, the events seem completely detached from the economic, political and social context in which they occur.

Having grown up in Sicily, the motherland of Italian organised crime, Camilleri used his fiction to mock and expose the mob, as Sciascia had. The bravura opening of Camilleri\u2019s The Potters Field gives Montalbano a nightmare in which the mafia has become the government of the country openly, rather than, as the reader is invited to think, covertly.</p> <p>\u201cAn amazing thing happens in Italy,\u201d Camilleri told me. \u201cThat we have MPs and senators involved with the mafia.

      "bodyText": "Andrea Camilleri, who has died aged 93, was one of the latest starters and latest finishers in crime fiction. He was almost 70 \u2013 after a rich career as a theatre director, TV producer, playwright and novelist in other genres \u2013 when, finding himself stuck on a historical story, he distracted himself by quickly writing a detective story. In a sort of literary European Union, he was influenced by three literary heroes: the Belgian Georges Simenon, creator of Inspector Maigret; Leonardo Sciascia, author of The Day of the Owl, who was a native of Sicily like Camilleri; and the Spanish writer Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n. First met by Italian readers in La forma dell\u2019acqua in 1994 (in English as The Shape of Water in 2002), Camilleri\u2019s cop, Commissario Salvo Montalbano shared many traits with his creator: a Sicilian with a love of literature, cigarettes and food. As in Montalb\u00e1n\u2019s Inspector Pepe Carvalho books, Montalbano \u2013 named in homage to the Spanish novelist \u2013 uses delicious cuisine as a counterweight to his deathly profession. Eating, Camilleri liked to say, is one of the greatest pleasures the dead surrender. After his delayed start in the mystery form, Camilleri wrote fast. Their sales accelerated by an atmospheric TV series (seen on BBC4 in the UK and SBS in Australia), 27 Montalbano novels have been published in Italy to date. The 24th will make it to English this September, when The Other End of the Line will be published. That book starts with Montalbano dealing with a huge group of political refugees arriving on the Sicilian coast \u2013 a characteristic topicality in a series of novels that have followed Italy into the eras of the euro, the contentious governments of Silvio Berlusconi (to whom Camilleri was strongly opposed), and Euroscepticism. \u201cIn many crime novels, the events seem completely detached from the economic, political and social context in which they occur. In my books, I deliberately decided to smuggle into a detective novel a critical commentary on my times,\u201d he told me when I interviewed him in Rome \u2013 still furiously chain-smoking at the age of 88 \u2013 in 2012. A strong undercurrent in the Montalbano books is the pressure on the Italian state from three outside sources: the Roman Catholic church, the US and the mafia. Having grown up in Sicily, the motherland of Italian organised crime, Camilleri used his fiction to mock and expose the mob, as Sciascia had. The bravura opening of Camilleri\u2019s The Potters Field gives Montalbano a nightmare in which the mafia has become the government of the country openly, rather than, as the reader is invited to think, covertly. \u201cAn amazing thing happens in Italy,\u201d Camilleri told me. \u201cThat we have MPs and senators involved with the mafia. They continue to be called honourable when they are not at all. It\u2019s not far from that to taking over power.\u201d He considered it his duty to speak out against the dark politics by which his country was often seduced, regularly appearing as a pundit on Italian TV shows where he was torrentially opinionated, intelligent and witty. Camilleri became so recognisable that, unusually for a novelist, he was impersonated by satirists and comedians. Complimented for \u201ccourage\u201d in calling out the gangsters, Camilleri pointed out that he was the beneficiary of the contradiction that mafiosi hated criticism from judges and journalists \u2013 many of whom they executed \u2013 but were flattered by being fictionalised; for example, obsessively quoting The Godfather. The pleasure of his own crime fiction was often informed by his long career before arriving at the genre. Producing a long-running Italian TV adaptation of Simenon\u2019s Maigret novels gave him an intensive course in plotting. Decades of directing the game-playing stage plays of Luigi Pirandello, such as Six Characters in Search of an Author, showed in Camilleri\u2019s fondness for structural tricks. The two writers shared a Sicilian birthplace, Porto Empedocle, where statues of Pirandello and Camilleri now face each other in the town. There will be at least one more novel. In our interview, he told me that \u2013 as Agatha Christie did with Hercule Poirot in Curtain \u2013 he had deposited with his publisher Riccardino, a final novel in which Montalbano is \u201cfinished off\u201d that was to only be published posthumously. It should be a fitting epitaph to one of the latest, but greatest, careers in crime writing.",

The foreign ministry did not dispute that Russia had blocked the visas but said US authorities had been misclassifying the teachers as embassy employees. \u201cTeachers in the American school are sent to Russia as embassy employees with diplomatic passports, although the school is a commercial enterprise,\u201d the foreign ministry said, according to Russian state media. \u201cThe US government, clearly, has specially created a dead-end situation to invent its latest scandal, of which its citizens have become hostages.\u201d It is not the first time the Anglo-American school has been targeted. In 2018, city officials in St Petersburg informed the school it would have to vacate its building within a matter of days. The school served 140 children in the city. US and British consulates in St Petersburg were closed earlier that year. The US has shuttered Russian consulates in Seattle and San Francisco, and ordered Russia to vacate several diplomatic annex buildings in New York and Washington DC. A teacher at the school said staff were not surprised by the visa troubles and they had been expecting \u201cblowback\u201d as a result of the chill in US-Russian relations. \u201cIt isn\u2019t coming as a total surprise to anyone. We can all see how tense it is,\u201d said the teacher, who asked not to be named because he had been told not to speak to the media. Founded in 1949, the Anglo-American school was chartered by the American, British and Canadian embassies and has educated generations of English-speaking children since the cold war. Its campus is located in north-west Moscow by a community sometimes called the \u201cAmerican settlement\u201d. The 30 teachers make up an estimated one-fifth of the teaching staff, and the embassy said some students may be disenrolled as a result.",

      "bodyText": "Google has suspended the secondary ticketing company Viagogo from its paid-for search results, globally and with immediate effect, a potentially huge blow to the website\u2019s ability to do business. The search engine\u2019s surprise decision, which was welcomed by campaign groups and MPs including the digital minister, Margot James, comes with Viagogo also facing legal action from the Competition and Markets Authority. Google said it had found Viagogo in breach of its advertising policy and would begin removing its ads on Wednesday. The Swiss-based website\u2019s listings have previously appeared at the very top of the page when consumers search for tickets, even for gigs by artists who have condemned the website, such as Ed Sheeran. Campaigners say this has led to buyers assuming the site is authorised by their favourite acts to sell tickets. It has plummeted down the search results after Google\u2019s decision and sits among smaller rivals which have not paid to appear above standard search rankings \u2013 and well below its main rival, StubHub, whose ads are still being accepted. \u201cWhen people use our platform for help in purchasing tickets, we want to make sure that they have an experience they can trust,\u201d said a Google spokesperson. \u201cThis is why we have strict policies and take necessary action when we find an advertiser in breach.\u201d James said: \u201cViagogo have routinely flouted the rules, and I\u2019m pleased to see Google taking proactive steps to protect consumers.\u201d Viagogo has come under fire for practices such as \u201cprofiteering\u201d from charity concerts, selling tickets whose buyers might be denied entry and colluding with professional touts accused of exploiting fans. An undercover investigation by the Guardian last year found that the company had resold tickets for football matches in England, bypassing laws designed to improve safety. The CMA is seeking to have the company found in contempt of court for allegedly ignoring repeated warnings to comply with consumer law. Google was urged to stop accepting money from Viagogo in an open letter signed by the Football Association, several MPs and the trade body UK Music last year. The letter said that Viagogo\u2019s prominence in search results, via the search engine\u2019s paid service Google Ads, was luring consumers into buying sports, music and theatre tickets that may be invalid. Google\u2019s decision to stop taking Viagogo\u2019s money is thought to have been influenced by action being taken against the company by multiple regulators worldwide, including the CMA. A spokesperson for Viagogo said: \u201cWe were extremely surprised to learn of Google\u2019s concerns today. We are confident that there has been no breach of Google\u2019s policies and look forward to working with them to resolve this as quickly as possible.\u201d FanFair Alliance, a music industry group backed by artists including Iron Maiden, Adele, Nick Cave and the Arctic Monkeys, has led the campaign to have Viagogo ads removed from Google. The organisation\u2019s campaign manager, Adam Webb, said: \u201cThis is a landmark moment, and a major step forward to preventing exploitation of audiences in the secondary ticketing market. \u201cAfter publishing extensive research highlighting the impacts of Viagogo\u2019s misleading search advertising, FanFair Alliance has been in constructive conversations with Google for over two years in an attempt to address this issue.\u201d The group called on other platforms such as Facebook to follow Google\u2019s example. Claire Turnham, awarded an MBE for her work in securing refunds for consumers who bought tickets from Viagogo, said she was \u201cecstatic\u201d. \u201cGiven almost every victim of Viagogo across the UK and beyond comes via Google we are thrilled they have taken this definitive action to protect the public from ticket abuse worldwide.\u201d The Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said: \u201cA well-respected brand such as Google should have done this a long time ago.

The civil disobedience movement is staging five days of non-violent disruption in five cities around the UK to urge the government to take immediate action to address the climate emergency. In Bristol, protesters also glued themselves to a pink bathtub on a middle lane section of the motorway. Demonstrations also continued in Leeds, London, Cardiff and Glasgow.

Just don\u2019t explode when it emerges that not everyone fancies spending 18 euros on a single prawn. Anticipate hanger Without appropriate planning, summer cheer can abruptly curdle into hunger-induced fury. Sure, join that massive queue for a trendy new opening. But \u2013 and I cannot stress this enough \u2013 take provisions. A sack of Haribo, say. Or a crate of cereal bars. After all, eating on holiday may be a joy, but it is also an endurance test.",

He won four and drew two of his first six derbies, but lost the last three and a 2-1 home defeat by Villa on 11 November 2007 proved to be his last game. He took over at Villa Park in October 2016, but was sacked two years later after a run of nine league games which brought just one victory and left the club well off the Championship promotion pace. He did, however, boast a derby record of two wins and two draws.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>North-east:</b> Sunderland called on Bruce in June 2009 and he did not disappoint. He guided the club to a 13th-placed Premier League finish at the end of his first campaign and 10th 12 months later, the club's best return since the Peter Reid era.

      "body": "<p>Recently I had coffee with a fellow veteran. She recalled her experience of going to sea with the Royal Navy for the first time. On being shown which compartments she could use to dry laundry, she had her attention drawn to special cages for her underwear \u201cso it wouldn\u2019t get stolen\u201d by men on board. She thought at the time this was thoughtful treatment of women at sea. She and I have together come to see these sorts of behaviours very differently.</p> <p>I experienced being told explicitly \u201cI wasn\u2019t welcome\u201d as a woman in a new role, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a problem that I was a woman\u201d in another more senior role; the former comment openly hostile but the latter more subtly demeaning. These comments came from men ranked above me at different points in my career. I felt at the time I had \u201cto suck it up\u201d and I, like my friend, struggled with recognising unacceptable behaviour for what it was. This, I believe, is part of the problem identified by the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/817838/20190607_Defence_Report_Inappropriate_Behaviours_Final_ZKL.pdf\" title=\"\">Ministry of Defence in its Report on Inappropriate Behaviours</a>.</p> <p>The report deliberately focuses on culture and behaviours. <a href=\"https://www.raf.mod.uk/news/articles/chief-of-air-staff-appointment-announced/\" title=\"\">Air Marshal Mike Wigston</a>, due to take over as the RAF\u2019s chief of the air staff later this month, rightly identifies that cultural change moves slowly in the armed forces, not least because the march to the top of those organisations is inherently hierarchical.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/16/mod-promises-changes-after-report-into-harassment-in-army\" title=\"\">The report</a> makes for a frank and thought-provoking read. As a straight white woman, I can speak personally only to the discussions of sexism and hope that veterans of colour, for example, will feel similarly encouraged to speak out with me on the report\u2019s discussions on racism and sexual orientation.</p> <p>The report correctly identifies that pride in military service and a \u201cprotect the cap badge\u201d mentality can hold organisations back from dealing fully with complaints.</p> <p>In my experience, there is a deeper issue at play: those currently serving find it hard to see or admit that inappropriate behaviours are something they have witnessed or experienced. They self-police not only out of fear of the consequences for themselves or their team, but because they feel signed up to maintaining a code of honour and pride in their service. I\u2019m not talking about the most egregious examples of harassment and bullying but the kind of thing a campaign such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EverydaySexism\" title=\"\">#EverydaySexism</a> exposes.

      "bodyText": "Recently I had coffee with a fellow veteran. She recalled her experience of going to sea with the Royal Navy for the first time. On being shown which compartments she could use to dry laundry, she had her attention drawn to special cages for her underwear \u201cso it wouldn\u2019t get stolen\u201d by men on board. She thought at the time this was thoughtful treatment of women at sea. She and I have together come to see these sorts of behaviours very differently. I experienced being told explicitly \u201cI wasn\u2019t welcome\u201d as a woman in a new role, \u201cit wasn\u2019t a problem that I was a woman\u201d in another more senior role; the former comment openly hostile but the latter more subtly demeaning. These comments came from men ranked above me at different points in my career. I felt at the time I had \u201cto suck it up\u201d and I, like my friend, struggled with recognising unacceptable behaviour for what it was. This, I believe, is part of the problem identified by the Ministry of Defence in its Report on Inappropriate Behaviours. The report deliberately focuses on culture and behaviours. Air Marshal Mike Wigston, due to take over as the RAF\u2019s chief of the air staff later this month, rightly identifies that cultural change moves slowly in the armed forces, not least because the march to the top of those organisations is inherently hierarchical. The report makes for a frank and thought-provoking read. As a straight white woman, I can speak personally only to the discussions of sexism and hope that veterans of colour, for example, will feel similarly encouraged to speak out with me on the report\u2019s discussions on racism and sexual orientation. The report correctly identifies that pride in military service and a \u201cprotect the cap badge\u201d mentality can hold organisations back from dealing fully with complaints. In my experience, there is a deeper issue at play: those currently serving find it hard to see or admit that inappropriate behaviours are something they have witnessed or experienced. They self-police not only out of fear of the consequences for themselves or their team, but because they feel signed up to maintaining a code of honour and pride in their service. I\u2019m not talking about the most egregious examples of harassment and bullying but the kind of thing a campaign such as #EverydaySexism exposes. This is deeply unhealthy and makes it harder for people with more serious complaints to come forward. The RAF\u2019s experience of tackling flight safety is relevant here. In order to significantly improve safety, the service identified that a cultural change was required. Aircrew needed to know that highlighting flight safety issues was not something that would invite criticism \u2013 instead honesty was rewarded. Gradually, issues that had been reported anonymously, if at all, were discussed openly: it was not credible to deny they existed. It\u2019s not a directly applicable example, but if we aren\u2019t all prepared to discuss inappropriate behaviours, then the military won\u2019t make the cultural change Wigston seeks. In 1992, my first RAF station warrant officer (SWO), the most senior non-commissioned officer on the base, was a woman \u2013 she was a brilliant role model. However, the RAF likes to point to early achievements such as this, the first women pilots, and being the first force to open all its roles to women. Yet the post of the most senior warrant officer in the RAF, the chief of the air staff\u2019s warrant officer, has never been held by a woman. Surely, in all those years since I experienced the formidable leadership of a female SWO, the RAF could have found one woman to fill that top job? Not for the sake of being the first, but because it has those women within their ranks. It\u2019s often only when we leave that we discuss these issues more openly. We look round the back of the Potemkin village and see what we couldn\u2019t see when we were serving. In responding to this report, the MoD might want to reach out to veterans with lengthy service experience, pride in our service, but also independence from the armed forces. Wigston has identified the importance of diversity training at every level of the military from junior non-commissioned to higher command. The report quotes a flagship charity: \u201ca centrally produced PowerPoint slide pack, sent out to be delivered as mandatory training will not fix this \u2026 \u201d. Too right. My experience of diversity training was that a minority of senior officers treated the course with disdain: evidence that the \u201cPC brigade\u201d had taken hold.

The report argued this means decisions are taken \u201cthousands of miles away from the place of application\u2026 and far away from local expertise, context and insight that could previously be provided by local embassies\u201d. Last month, the Guardian spoke to several African researchers about the \u201carbitrary\u201d reasons they received for failed UK visa applications. As well as being rejected for having too little money, some applicants were told they had too much money, or were rejected for not having children because this made them \u201clikely to fail to return home\u201d. In April, a team of six Ebola researchers from Sierra Leone was unable to attend training in the UK, funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of a \u00a31.5m flagship pandemic preparedness programme. The same month, only one of 25 researchers scheduled to participate at a workshop at the London School of Economics Africa summit was present. A major concern mentioned by many who gave evidence for the report was the apparently hostile and disbelieving nature of many refusals. One highly experienced Ebola researcher refused a UK visa was told: \u201cOn the balance of probability, we don\u2019t believe you are a researcher.\u201d The chair of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), the UN\u2019s cultural body, recently warned that major conferences will in future be held outside the UK because of visa difficulties. The LSE and University of Sussex are already holding conferences outside the UK to avoid visa delays and refusals, even when the conferences are funded by the British government. The report\u2019s authors said the problems inherent in the system were \u201ceasily remediable\u201d, suggesting faster processing for people having to travel long distances to apply, as well as an end to financial requirements for visitors who are fully funded by UK institutions. The MPs also said refusal letters should be more carefully scrutinised before being sent out to avoid prejudice or biased assumptions. Onwurah said: \u201cIt needs to be recognised that no single issue does more damage to the image or influence of the UK in Africa than this visa question.\u201d",

For many of us, this is a pattern that never fitted, and though we did the urban thing to burst (or tiptoe) from the closet, the lure of the rural soon overwhelmed the anonymity of the city. It didn\u2019t feel like a choice, but something intrinsic that would have been dangerous to resist, like the act of coming out itself.</p> <p>So it was for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/aug/15/reg-mickisch-and-george-walton-obituary\">George Walton and Reg Mickisch</a>, an elegant couple who met in the postwar rubble of London, and in 1972 headed for the sticks, opening a B&amp;B in a tiny mid-Wales village. They became much-loved members of our thinly scattered community, and great friends. When they died within a few weeks of each other in 2011, aged 94 and 84, my boyfriend and I found that they had left us their old farmhouse. In us, they saw themselves, and the feeling was mutual. Their legacy was far greater than that though, for it included an archive of letters, diaries, photos, art and books that told a remarkable story. My book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/on-the-red-hill-9781785151934.html\">On the Red Hill</a> is that story \u2013 and so many others.</p> <p>In researching it, I read widely around the topic of the \u201cqueer rural\u201d. There wasn\u2019t much, at least not explicitly so. Even more than is normally the case with LGBT+ history, that meant learning to read the shadows, to spot fragmentary connections that had previously been denied or ignored. The truth was clear: we are not newcomers to the countryside. We\u2019ve always been here. In Wales, there is a long tradition of <em>yr hen lanc</em> (literally \u201cthe old lad\u201d), the unmarried uncle who might live with, or next door to, his equally unmarried friend. Every village had its <em>hen lanc</em>, and his female equivalents too.</p> <p>These are some of the books that chimed most sonorously in my research.

      "bodyText": "Choux pastry and cream is always a winning combination. Add orange blossom, a crunchy craquelin topping and cats, and it\u2019s somehow even better. And I love the perfumed, summery flavour of orange blossom. Makes: 5 rings Prep time: 20 mins for the choux, 10 mins for the craquelin, 5 mins for the filling, plus decoration Bake time: 30 mins For the craquelin: 75g light muscovado sugar 75g unsalted butter 75g plain flour For the choux: 85g unsalted butter 225g water Pinch of salt 50g plain flour 50g strong white flour 2-3 medium eggs For the filling: 150g double cream 50g icing sugar 1 tsp orange blossom water Orange food dye To decorate: Black gel food dye Pink wafer paper Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/400F/gas mark 6. First make the craquelin. Cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy, then add the flour and stir until combined. Roll out to 3mm (\u215bin) thick between two sheets of clingfilm, then place in the fridge until firm. For the choux pastry, chop the butter and put it in a small saucepan with the water and salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is starting to bubble. Meanwhile, weigh out the flours in a separate bowl. When the mixture is bubbling, remove it from the heat and add the flour all in one go. Stir with a wooden spoon until it forms a smooth ball that pulls away from the sides very easily. Transfer to a stand mixer bowl with a paddle attachment and leave to cool for five to 10 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on slow speed after each addition until combined. Whisk the third egg in a separate bowl and add gradually, a tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition. You are looking for a glossy consistency, which leaves a V when a spoon is lifted out of the dough. Transfer to a piping bag and cut a medium tip. On a lined baking tray, pipe out five blobs in a circle, then repeat until you have five circles. Take the craquelin out of the freezer and stamp out small discs to place on to each blob of choux. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4 and bake for a further 20 minutes. Allow to cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, make the filling: whip the cream with the rest of the listed ingredients. Cut each choux ring in half horizontally, then fill with the cream. Draw the facial features using a toothpick with black food dye on the end, then add ears cut from the wafer paper.",

Following reports that he clashed last week with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, by telling him the EU withdrawal agreement was dead, Barclay said this was \u201cnot a controversial observation\u201d. \u201cIn terms of the withdrawal agreement, what I said was that the House had rejected it three times, including the third time by a significant margin; that the European election results in my view had further hardened attitudes across the house and that the text, unchanged, I did not envisage going through the house,\u201d he said. He said: \u201cA no-deal Brexit would be disruptive,\u201d but added: \u201cNo Brexit is the worst of those two outcomes.\u201d Barclay also revealed that the government was looking at compensating sheep farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit, following warnings from the National Farmers\u2019 Union that this would result in shepherds being forced to slaughter their flocks because there would be no market for their meat. He said the sheep meat industry was an \u201coutlier\u201d because 97% of exports went to the EU but the government was working on intervention measures and compensation. Barclay set out his view that parliament would be asked to vote on any new deal achieved by the next prime minister, and then if that was rejected, it would be offered a choice of revoking Brexit or leaving with no deal. \u201cBut the question then will be is there a deal that is palatable to parliament and if not will parliament vote to revoke or will we leave with no deal?\u201d However, any prime minister going down that path could face a no-confidence motion first. Tory backbenchers fighting a hard Brexit, including Hammond, Dominic Grieve, Justine Greening and Guto Bebb, would have to weigh up whether to vote to bring down their own government and risk a general election rather than allow the UK to depart on no-deal terms.",

      "bodyText": "The first ever excavation of the main allied field hospital at the Battle of Waterloo has uncovered sawn-off limbs and musket balls fired during a previously unrecorded fight on the steps of the farm where the Duke of Wellington\u2019s medics worked. The surprise find by British and Dutch archeologists, digging alongside 25 military veterans, opens up a new understanding of how the Mont-St-Jean field hospital was engulfed by war on 18 June 1815. The pioneering archaeological survey has been expanded as a result of the discoveries, which includes 58 musket balls unearthed this Monday alone. About 6,000 wounded men are believed to have passed through the makeshift hospital during the Battle of Waterloo to receive primitive medical care for their injuries, including amputations without anaesthetic. Among the patients there were William II of the Netherlands, otherwise known as the Prince of Orange, and Wellington\u2019s military secretary, Lt Col Lord FitzRoy Somerset, who had his arm amputated. Archaeologists found three leg bones at the site, one of which bears the marks of the surgeon\u2019s saw from an amputation above the knee, providing gruesome evidence of the surgeons\u2019 work. The heavy concentration of balls found at the site, fired both from the allied Brown Bess infantry muskets and the smaller calibre French weapons, suggests that a fight also took place there, potentially after Napoleon\u2019s generals ordered a cavalry charge on the grounds of Mont-St-Jean, now an orchard, which lay about 0.3 miles (600 metres) behind the main allied line. A six-pound cast iron French cannon ball found on the site is believed to have been fired late in the day of the battle, at about 6pm when French troops captured the farm of La Haye Sainte. At that point the French were closest they would ever get to victory and able to bring up horse artillery batteries of the Imperial Guard to bombard the allied lines with round shot and canister from very close range, causing devastating casualties. It was only the arrival of Prussians on the extreme left flank of Wellington\u2019s army that saved the front from being broken. Prof Tony Pollard from the University of Glasgow, who is the lead academic on the Waterloo Uncovered dig organised by the Waterloo Uncovered charity, said the discovery of human remains was unexpected and poignant. He said: \u201cIn one of the trenches surveyed by metal detectors. a signal relating to a large metal object led the team of archaeologists to excavate further. They found human remains, the first time Waterloo Uncovered has encountered such a find. \u201cAfter working with the local authorities to establish that the bones did not relate to a modern burial, work continued and has revealed at least three leg bones. These appear to be the remains of amputated limbs from some of the operations carried out by surgeons. \u201cFinding human remains immediately changes the atmosphere on a dig. Suddenly there is a very poignant connection with the people who suffered here in 1815, a connection that has not been lost on the Waterloo Uncovered team of veterans and serving personnel. The next stage is to carefully excavate and remove the bones for further examination.\u201d Waterloo Uncovered, a charity bringing archaeologists together to work with ex-military personnel, was founded by two Coldstream Guards officers, Charles Foinette and Mark Evans, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a tour in Afghanistan. Among the group working on the site are military personnel wounded or suffering from PTSD after action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their ages range from 19 \u2013 a soldier serving in the Coldstream Guards who is recuperating from training injuries \u2013 to mid-70s. In 2015, Waterloo Uncovered\u2019s excavation of the battle site at Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Hougoumont, the farmhouse defended by the Coldstream Guards, discovered musket balls from some of the first shots exchanged between the French and allied troops and evidence of the close-quarters fighting.",

If you\u2019d prefer to use French beans instead, bring a pan of salted water to a boil, simmer them for a couple of minutes until just tender, then decant into a sink of cold water to stop them cooking. Dry before use.</p> <h2><strong>3 \u2026 and then the tomatoes</strong></h2> <p>Put the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds, then scoop out and, once cool enough to handle, gently peel off their skins \u2013 if they haven\u2019t split in the heat, use your fingernail or the tip of a small, sharp knife to help tease off enough to get started.

Add the anchovies \u2013 if they\u2019ve been packed in salt, rather than oil, you\u2019ll need to give them a quick rinse first \u2013 and mash them, followed by the basil.

Using your hands, lift out the dressed salad and arrange on a serving plate.</p> <h2><strong>7 Add the eggs, capers, olives and anchovies</strong></h2> <p>Gently knock the blunt end of each egg against a hard surface until it cracks, then peel. Cut the eggs into quarters and season lightly. Arrange these on top of the salad. Pit the olives, if you like, and rinse the salt off the capers and anchovies, if need be. Cut the anchovies into slivers. Scatter the olives, capers and anchovies all over the salad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41d2efb39e94e47eeb225451de3a53d45086973d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41d2efb39e94e47eeb225451de3a53d45086973d/67_508_6730_6793/991.jpg\" alt=\"Toss the cut veg in dressing, lift on to a plate and add egg, anchovy, olives and capers.

Eat with some good baguette to mop up all of those delicious juices. Note: the salad itself can be made a few hours in advance, and left to let the ingredients mingle, but don\u2019t add the basil until the last minute.</p> <h2><strong>9 Alternatives</strong></h2> <p>If you\u2019d like to add tuna, as is often used in Provence, leave out the anchovies from the salad itself, if not the dressing (though you can eschew them altogether, if you prefer) \u2013 a small tin, drained and flaked over the top, is quite sufficient. Boiled waxy potatoes, a popular addition in the UK, are not authentic, nor required, but if you must, I won\u2019t tell.</p>",

Drain the water from the eggs and put them in cold water to stop them cooking further. 2 Prepare the beans \u2026 Pop the broad beans from their pods, then peel off their papery skins (unless they\u2019re very young, in which case you can leave them on). If you\u2019d prefer to use French beans instead, bring a pan of salted water to a boil, simmer them for a couple of minutes until just tender, then decant into a sink of cold water to stop them cooking. Dry before use. 3 \u2026 and then the tomatoes Put the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds, then scoop out and, once cool enough to handle, gently peel off their skins \u2013 if they haven\u2019t split in the heat, use your fingernail or the tip of a small, sharp knife to help tease off enough to get started. Cut in half, scoop out and discard the seeds, then cut the flesh into thick slices. 4 Now for the cucumber, onion and pepper Peel the cucumber (I like to do this in stripes, but then I like stripes on everything), cut it in half lengthways, then scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut the cucumber into chunky half-moons. Finely chop the spring onions. Deseed the pepper and cut it into fairly thin strips. 5 Make the dressing Put the peeled garlic clove into a mortar with a pinch of coarse salt, then mash to a paste. Add the anchovies \u2013 if they\u2019ve been packed in salt, rather than oil, you\u2019ll need to give them a quick rinse first \u2013 and mash them, followed by the basil. Finally, incorporate the vinegar and then the olive oil until well emulsified. Season to taste. 6 Start building the salad Toss the beans, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, spring onion and red pepper in a large bowl with two-thirds of the dressing, until everything is thoroughly coated. Using your hands, lift out the dressed salad and arrange on a serving plate. 7 Add the eggs, capers, olives and anchovies Gently knock the blunt end of each egg against a hard surface until it cracks, then peel. Cut the eggs into quarters and season lightly. Arrange these on top of the salad. Pit the olives, if you like, and rinse the salt off the capers and anchovies, if need be. Cut the anchovies into slivers. Scatter the olives, capers and anchovies all over the salad. 8 The finishing touches Spoon the rest of the dressing on top of the salad, then strew the basil leaves on top just before serving. Eat with some good baguette to mop up all of those delicious juices. Note: the salad itself can be made a few hours in advance, and left to let the ingredients mingle, but don\u2019t add the basil until the last minute. 9 Alternatives If you\u2019d like to add tuna, as is often used in Provence, leave out the anchovies from the salad itself, if not the dressing (though you can eschew them altogether, if you prefer) \u2013 a small tin, drained and flaked over the top, is quite sufficient. Boiled waxy potatoes, a popular addition in the UK, are not authentic, nor required, but if you must, I won\u2019t tell.",

It began with a bang as an 18-year-old at Sheffield United, when he was given his debut in a League Cup quarter-final, coincidentally against Southampton, which ended in a 1-0 win and, shortly after, took in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/28/sheffield-united-tottenham-hotspur-capital-one-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">a cameo against Spurs</a> in the second leg of the semi-final.

You get a feel for when someone doesn\u2019t want you, when you are kind of getting pushed away. It was just disappointment; towards myself and the people that helped me get there.</p> <p>\u201cBut it either pushes you on or knocks you back. At that age, it\u2019s make or break. You either go down the education route or you keep working hard at your football. That\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t really get on with the academy life and it was the right decision for me to go another way.\u201d</p> <p>Adams\u2019s salvation came at Ilkeston, the Derbyshire club that played in the seventh tier. He joined after a spell further down at Oadby, initially travelling from his home in Leicester, taking an early morning train to Derby followed by a long bus journey, before he moved into digs. Ilkeston trained full-time \u2013 a rarity at that level \u2013 and, for Adams, there was also a BTec level 3 college course in sports studies.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d train in the morning, get lunch \u2013 we\u2019d have to walk to Tesco or something like that \u2013 and then it would be back in for education,\u201d Adams says. \u201cCollege was all right. The majority of the people were just there for the football, you could tell. I moved up to Ilkeston at 16, 17 and it was there that I first came to grips with the sacrifices you have to make to be at the top.\u201d</p> <p>Adams remembers being paid \u201c\u00a375 a week or maybe \u00a375 a game\u201d after he broke into the Ilkeston first team and he certainly earned it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how hard you\u2019re going to get kicked,\u201d he says. \u201cYou definitely get kicked harder in non\u2011league because the referee is all the way in the other penalty box or on the other side of the pitch.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s frustrating but I was a little boy and I couldn\u2019t really say anything to the older men, could I? It\u2019s a little kid running around you and you just want to kick him as hard as you can to stop him from doing that.\u201d</p> <p>In the first few months of the 2014-15 season, Adams was the most in-demand player in non-league football. \u201cSixteen games, 11 goals, nine assists,\u201d he says, showing the total recall of a striker for personal statistics. More than 40 clubs sent scouts to watch him on one occasion. \u201cI was reading all sorts about myself,\u201d Adams says. \u201cIt was overwhelming and special.\u201d In November 2014 Nigel Clough paid \u00a3135,000 to take him to Sheffield United.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78c0dfc378426d839a6dbc88e15b909f844636b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78c0dfc378426d839a6dbc88e15b909f844636b1/0_131_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Che Adams celebrates for Birmingham City at Norwich in January 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Che Adams celebrates for Birmingham City at Norwich in January 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel French/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adams\u2019s value has since soared \u2013 Birmingham have turned a tidy profit on the \u00a32m that they stumped up to get him from Bramall Lane in 2016 \u2013 but what is striking is how there is nothing remotely big-time about him.</p> <p>He fears that he might have messed up in his unveiling interview with Southampton\u2019s in-house media team, when he said that he now wanted to win the Premier League and, yes, it led to the inevitable mockery on social media.

      "body": "<p>Remember when everyone left doors unlocked and borrowed cups of sugar? No? Then this richly researched history of community may well appeal. Jon Lawrence uncovers the reality behind romantic cliches of our postwar past. He convincingly suggests that the real history of community is one in which people have combined solidarity with self-reliance and privacy.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a new conclusion, as Lawrence acknowledges \u2013 his copious notes are a valuable guide for anyone interested in the social histories he draws on. But <em>Me, Me, Me?</em> takes an intriguing route to explore how the myth of community was constructed, and how it might be dismantled. The book revisits several social investigations \u2013 ranging from an inner-city area designated for slum clearance to a former mining village \u2013 conducted between the 1950s and the 2000s. One of Lawrence\u2019s most vital points is that policymakers and journalists derive their nostalgic notions of \u201ccommunity\u201d from a partial understanding of these studies. A closer reading reveals discontent with overcrowded conditions, frustration at prying neighbours and the hopelessness of poverty. Ambitions were real, people were active and many welcomed the chance to move to spacious housing in the suburbs.</p> <p>He makes his case with great clarity. Apposite quotations bring the survey respondents to life. He draws our attention to contrasts between regions and generations (sadly there is less examination of the differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s experiences). <em>Me, Me, Me?</em> challenges the notion that a \u201ctypical\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/03/unmaking-english-working-class-richard-benson\" title=\"\">working-class community</a> ever existed.</p> <p>Contrary to popular assumption, many older people wanted not only to live apart from their children but at a considerable distance from them. Mrs Whiteside, who lived in Bethnal Green in the 50s, complained that her daughters \u201ccome to me with all their troubles \u2026 about having no money\u201d. This corroborates the argument made by the historian Pat Thane, who has shown that most pensioners prefer to retain their independence in old age rather than rely on their families for care. It also reinforces Lawrence\u2019s central point: that people want to exercise independence while relying on the wider community for amenities they can\u2019t provide for themselves.</p> <p>Moving out of the inner city was not always experienced as loss. An illuminating chapter on Stevenage shows how new towns fostered ambition and opportunity in an era of strong local government and a generous welfare state.

      "body": "<p>Had Andrea Camilleri died in his 50s, his obituary would certainly not have been published in the Guardian. His death might have been noted in the cultural sections of the odd Italian newspaper and it would doubtless have merited a substantial article in the journal of Italy\u2019s pre-eminent drama school, the Accademia Nazionale d\u2019Arte Drammatica, where Camilleri was for many years in charge of teaching directing.</p> <p>The article might have detailed the achievements of an avant-garde, leftwing intellectual who had had a significant influence on theatre and television in Italy while remaining largely unknown to the general public. It would probably have skipped over the fact that, some years earlier, Camilleri had tried his hand at writing historical novels, but given up after meeting with little success beyond the award of an obscure literary prize, handed out by a town council in his native Sicily.</p> <p>What he managed to achieve subsequently constitutes a beacon of hope to a greying world.</p> <p>Camilleri was 66 when his first bestseller, La Stagione della Caccia (1992, published in English in 2014 as Hunting Season), appeared, and 68 when he published the first novel featuring the Sicilian detective, Salvo Montalbano, who was to bring him international renown. But that was only the half of it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview31\" title=\"\">Success</a> inspired Camilleri to a frenzy of literary activity at an age when most writers are in tranquil decline. Between 1994, when his first Montalbano story appeared, and his death, at the age of 93, he not only published 30 books detailing the exploits of his grouchy sleuth, but more than 60 others. Even allowing for anthologies, it was an astonishing achievement. There were years when Camilleri, already in his 80s, published eight titles. He was not so much an author as a one-man literary production line.</p> <p>Only son of Carmelina (nee Fragapane) and Giuseppe Camilleri, he grew up under Benito Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship in the town of Porto Empedocle on the Sicilian west coast.

      "bodyText": "Had Andrea Camilleri died in his 50s, his obituary would certainly not have been published in the Guardian. His death might have been noted in the cultural sections of the odd Italian newspaper and it would doubtless have merited a substantial article in the journal of Italy\u2019s pre-eminent drama school, the Accademia Nazionale d\u2019Arte Drammatica, where Camilleri was for many years in charge of teaching directing. The article might have detailed the achievements of an avant-garde, leftwing intellectual who had had a significant influence on theatre and television in Italy while remaining largely unknown to the general public. It would probably have skipped over the fact that, some years earlier, Camilleri had tried his hand at writing historical novels, but given up after meeting with little success beyond the award of an obscure literary prize, handed out by a town council in his native Sicily. What he managed to achieve subsequently constitutes a beacon of hope to a greying world. Camilleri was 66 when his first bestseller, La Stagione della Caccia (1992, published in English in 2014 as Hunting Season), appeared, and 68 when he published the first novel featuring the Sicilian detective, Salvo Montalbano, who was to bring him international renown. But that was only the half of it. Success inspired Camilleri to a frenzy of literary activity at an age when most writers are in tranquil decline. Between 1994, when his first Montalbano story appeared, and his death, at the age of 93, he not only published 30 books detailing the exploits of his grouchy sleuth, but more than 60 others. Even allowing for anthologies, it was an astonishing achievement. There were years when Camilleri, already in his 80s, published eight titles. He was not so much an author as a one-man literary production line. Only son of Carmelina (nee Fragapane) and Giuseppe Camilleri, he grew up under Benito Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship in the town of Porto Empedocle on the Sicilian west coast. His father was a harbour official who had taken an active part in the fascists\u2019 rise to power. Andrea was expelled from a diocesan school for throwing an egg that smashed on a crucifix, and he went on to complete his studies at a state school. But he never sat his final exams: the second world war was building to a climax and the exams were cancelled because of the imminent Allied landings in Sicily. Before the war was over, Camilleri had won a place at university. But he dropped out before obtaining a degree. As a young man, in the late 1940s, he had some success as a poet and author of short stories, even getting on to the short list for a prestigious literary award. But by the end of the decade he had found what, for most of his life, he regarded as his vocation \u2013 that of a theatre director.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel\u2019s favoured successor as chancellor has been appointed Germany\u2019s new defence minister in an unexpected and potentially risky move after Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s confirmation as European commission president. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, widely known in Germany as AKK, formally took over the role during a ceremony on Wednesday, a day after MEPs narrowly backed Von der Leyen\u2019s nomination, and will swear her oath of office in the Bundestag next week. Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, narrowly won the leadership of Merkel\u2019s centre-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) last year and had no cabinet role, a reason given by some opponents for objecting to her as a candidate for the chancellorship. But the job of defence minister is widely seen as a poisoned chalice. Germany\u2019s armed forces, which critics maintain have long been chronically underfunded, are consistently accused of inefficiency and of having inadequate or defective equipment. Originally thought likely to go to the ambitious young health minister, Jens Spahn, the defence job has been labelled \u201cthe ejector seat\u201d of German politics, after derailing the careers of several ministers who have held it. Von der Leyen, once seen as a potential chancellor, became one of Germany\u2019s least popular politicians during her five years in the post. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s colleagues welcomed the appointment. \u201cWhen such an important position, a core job in the cabinet, becomes available, then a CDU leader must step up and take responsibility, and she is doing that,\u201d said Ralph Brinkhaus, the leader of the CDU parliamentary caucus. \u201cIf you want to show leadership you don\u2019t consider the risk, you get on with the job. In life as in politics, there are always risks. If you don\u2019t trust yourself to take on hard tasks, you don\u2019t belong in politics.\u201d Sometimes called the \u201cmini-Merkel\u201d, Kramp-Karrenbauer has been poised to take over as chancellor since becoming CDU leader in December after Merkel announced she would not seek another term when her current term ended in 2021. But she has failed to connect effectively with voters, many of whom see her as out of touch, and came in for strong criticism after the party\u2019s record-low performance in the European parliamentary elections in May. After a succession of gaffes obliged Merkel to publicly dismiss reports that she had reached the conclusion her chosen successor was not up to the job, Kramp-Karrenbauer recently said she wanted to concentrate on reforming and reuniting the party rather than taking a ministerial job. Germany has faced calls from Donald Trump to boost its defence spending to the Nato target of 2% of GDP, which Merkel has said the country will work towards but her junior coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD), has dismissed as arbitrary.",

      "bodyText": "Ladbrokes owner GVC is planning to shift 200 jobs offshore, despite a rise in revenues as growth in online bets cushioned the impact of new curbs on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). Revenues rose by 5% in the first six months of the year, including the three months immediately after the government slashed maximum stakes on FOBTs from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. A 10% fall in revenue from its high-street bookmaking brands, Ladbrokes, Gala and Coral, was more than offset by an 18% surge in its online operation, which includes Sportingbet and Bwin. But despite the overall increase in revenues, a spokesperson for the Isle of Man-based company confirmed that staff in its Barking customer service centre have been told their roles could move to Gibraltar and Manila in the Philippines. The call centre is expected to close by the end of the year. \u201cFollowing the acquisition of Ladbrokes Coral last year, GVC has conducted an extensive review of its operations to ensure the business can best meet the needs of its customers while adapting to the changing regulatory circumstances in which it operates,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of this review, we have regrettably come to the conclusion that it may be necessary to close our customer service operations in Barking. \u201cWe regret the impact this will have on our valued workforce and where possible we will seek to find alternative roles for those affected within our wider business.\u201d The plan comes on top of an expected 900 high street shop closures in GVC\u2019s Ladbrokes Coral business, affecting up to 5,000 staff, which the company has blamed on FOBT curbs. Major bookmakers including William Hill and Betfred have also warned of shop closures and job losses, with about a quarter of Britain\u2019s high street shops thought to be at risk. A more detailed breakdown of GVC figures offered some insight into the financial impact of the changes. High street revenue for the first six months of the year, only half of which was affected by the stake cut, was down 10%. Taken on its own, the first three months of the new FOBT regime saw a steeper 19% decline in overall revenue. However, there was an 8% increase in income from sports betting, indicating some gamblers have abandoned machine play in favour of more traditional sporting wagers.",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Trump returns fire at \u2018squad\u2019 as House censures racist tweets The House of Representatives has passed a resolution condemning Donald Trump\u2019s tweets, in which he told several congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to where they \u201ccame from\u201d, as racist. The 240-187 vote on Tuesday split mostly along party lines, though four Republicans joined Democrats in approving the resolution. Rather than show remorse, Trump escalated his attacks, accusing the so-called \u201csquad\u201d of \u201cspewing \u2026vile, hateful and disgusting things.\u201d Yet his remarks appear to have struck a nerve with many Americans, who recognised in them their own experiences of racism. Kellyanne Conway. The president\u2019s cheerleader caused controversy on Tuesday, when she asked a reporter who pressed her on Trump\u2019s tweets: \u201cWhat\u2019s your ethnicity?\u201d Scared of the squad? Joshua Leifer argues that the real reason Trump has started attacking the squad is that he\u2019s terrified \u2013 of their politics, and of their popularity. Administration still deporting Venezuelans amid crisis Donald Trump says Venezuela is in the grip of a \u201cnightmare of poverty, hunger and death\u201d, yet his administration is continuing to deport Venezuelan asylum seekers by refusing to grant them temporary protected status. The crisis will likely displace more than 8 million Venezuelans by the end of 2020. The UN accuses the Maduro regime of killing thousands of people. Yet the acting US Citizenship and Immigration Services director, Ken Cuccinelli, said on Tuesday that the US was continuing \u201cto monitor the situation\u201d. Iraqi Christians. The administration is seeking to deport more than 1,400 Iraqi nationals, most of whom are Chaldean Catholics. They once saw Trump as their saviour, they tell Tom Perkins, but now they feel betrayed. Instagram under fire over images of murdered teenager Police have said they are speaking to Instagram and several other social media platforms, including Discord and 4chan, to determine how and why images of a murdered teenager\u2019s body came to be shared widely online. Bianca Devins, a 17-year-old from Utica, New York, was murdered on Sunday by Brandon Clark, 21, whom she had met via the photo-sharing app. Graphic post. Clark posted a photo of Devin\u2019s bloodied body with the caption \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bianca\u201d to Instagram, where it remained for several hours before the company removed his account for violating its terms of service. Retired justice John Paul Stevens dies John Paul Stevens, the Republican-nominated justice who unexpectedly became a champion of liberal values on the US supreme court, has died at home in Florida aged 99. Appointed by Gerald Ford in 1975, Stevens spent almost 35 years on the court, more than twice the average tenure, and retired in 2010, shortly after his 90th birthday. Liberal decisions. During his time as a justice, Stevens helped to limit the death penalty, expand gay rights, promote racial equality and preserve legal abortion. Last year, he came out against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation after sexual assault allegations against the Trump judicial nominee. Crib sheet Dr Leana Wen, the president of Planned Parenthood, has been forced out of her leadership role after just eight months, saying she had \u201cphilosophical differences\u201d with the organisation over its future direction. Mark Esper, Trump\u2019s nominee to become US defense secretary, has told a Senate confirmation hearing that the US is not seeking war with Iran and needs instead to \u201cget back on the diplomatic channel\u201d. Sudan\u2019s military rulers have signed an agreement to share power with civilian leaders until elections are held in three years\u2019 time, potentially ending months of political crisis and violent repression in the country. Police in Tennessee have warned residents not to flush methamphetamine down the toilet, in case alligators ingest the drug in the sewage system and turn into \u201chyped up\u201d and aggressive \u201cmeth-gators\u201d. Must-reads Can the images of the moon landings ever be surpassed? The photograph of Buzz Aldrin on the moon, taken by Neil Armstrong, is a revolutionary artistic masterpiece, writes Jonathan Jones. The images of the Apollo 11 lunar landing in July 1969 \u2013 the climax of a love affair between Nasa\u2019s astronauts and photography \u2013 altered human consciousness forever. The importance of women\u2019s nature-writing From Henry David Thoreau onwards, the landscape of nature-writing has been dominated by men. But for Megan Mayhew Berman, camping alone in the Adirondacks, it is the work of female writers such as Dr Anne LaBastille that offers a true view of the wilderness. What to do when you find a dinosaur skeleton In 2006, a rancher known as the Dino Cowboy dug up a remarkable fossil in the Montana badlands: a ceratopsian and a theropod \u2013 both over 20ft \u2013 preserved mid-fight. But 13 years later, only a handful of people have seen the \u201cduelling dinosaurs\u201d. Philip Pantuso asks why. China tries out Trump-style Twitter diplomacy Twitter may be banned in China, but the country\u2019s representatives abroad have started to make use of the platform to confront Beijing\u2019s critics.

Opinion The billionaire investor Peter Thiel claims Google\u2019s workforce has been infiltrated by Chinese government agents. The attempt to stoke racist paranoia about Asian-Americans in tech is merely a modern incarnation of the \u201cYellow Peril\u201d scare of the late 19th century, says Frank H Wu. The open hostility to Chinese people, as distinct from the Chinese government, violates norms integral to America itself. On the face of these utterances is the identification of a community, named by ancestry, as a problem.

      "bodyText": "A man has been convicted of using his car as a weapon to run over cyclists and police officers close to parliament. Salih Khater, 30, a failed accountancy student, carried out the \u201cpremeditated attack\u201d in August 2018. A jury at the Old Bailey in London convicted him of two counts of attempted murder. He will be sentenced at a later date. The trial heard that Khater, who was living in Birmingham at the time, had driven through the night to reach London and then, as the area around parliament filled up in the morning, turned his silver Ford Fiesta into a weapon. He was caught on CCTV hitting cyclists before moving on to a slip road and heading at speed towards police officers who were guarding a side entrance to the Palace of Westminster. The jury heard the prosecutor Alison Morgan QC say Khater wanted to cause mass casualties. She said: \u201cHis actions were not a mistake or as a result of some kind of mechanical error to his vehicle. They were deliberate and designed to cause maximum death and injury. He caused widespread fear and chaos, but miraculously, and contrary to his intentions, he did not kill anyone.\u201d The case was investigated by Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command and members of the jury were told they could infer his motivation was terrorism from the fact he chose asymbolic site. But Whitehall sources say they are not classing it as a terrorist attack and Khater had no extremist propaganda in his home or on his electronic devices such as his phone, which is highly unusual for a jihadist. A Whitehall source said: \u201cHe was not known to the security services and there is no indication of an extremist mindset.\u201d Morgan told the jury: \u201cYou may think that by targeting Parliament Square, by targeting people that he did not know, and ultimately by attacking police officers guarding the Palace of Westminster, the defendant had a terrorist motive. \u201cThat is to say that he intended to use serious violence to pursue a religious, political or ideological cause. The prosecution allege that this is the obvious inference from what he did, where he did it and how he did it. But in fact the charges that you have to consider do not require you to determine that issue.\u201d After the guilty verdicts the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s counter-terrorism division said it was reasonable to assume he had a terrorist motive because he chose an iconic site of national importance that had been previously attacked by terrorists. Jenny Hopkins, from the CPS, said: \u201cIt was only quick reactions and good luck that stopped Salih Khater killing anyone when he drove his car into cyclists and police officers outside Westminster. Whatever his motives, this was not an accident. It was a deliberate attempt to kill and maim as many people as possible.\u201d Khater\u2019s defence was that he was not trying to kill in the name of jihadism, but got lost in London and panicked. He said he had not eaten since the morning before. He recalled hitting the cyclists and, explaining why he had hurtled towards the police officers, told jurors: \u201cI would say I have tried to find somewhere to stop after the incident at the traffic light. I collided with the barrier where two police officers were standing.\u201d Security around the Palace of Westminster had been tightened after an attack in March 2017 by a terrorist who had used a vehicle as a weapon before stabbing a police officer to death in the grounds of parliament. Khater was originally from Darfur in Sudan. Morgan said his mood had worsened in the months before the incident and he had failed exams in accountancy at Coventry University. Khater was showing signs of paranoia about the actions of the UK authorities and he sent an email in May 2018 to Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, complaining about his treatment, the jury heard. Morgan said: \u201cThe response from a Labour party representative was understandably vague.\u201d He drove to London during the night and then drove around the Parliament Square area on August 2014 to familiarise himself with it. Immediately before driving his car at people, he \u201cconducted four laps\u201d around parliament, having waited for the area to get busier. Khater first hit cyclists, Morgan said, before driving at 32mph at PC Darren Shotton and PC Simon Short. Morgan told the jury: \u201cThe defendant selected an iconic site. This was no coincidence. It is a location of national importance, one that had been subjected to terrorist attacks in very recent history.\u201d Khater was arrested by armed police and did not claim the car was faulty, nor that he had a medical issue that may have explained his actions. He is believed to have been acting alone. In 2017, Britain suffered five terrorist attacks. Four claimed lives: those at Westminster Bridge and on parliament itself, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. An attempted bombing of an underground train at Parson\u2019s Green, west London, ended when a malfunction of the explosive device spared commuters from carnage. The verdicts on Wednesday are thought unlikely to change Whitehall\u2019s view that Khater was not a terrorist and that there were no jihadist attacks on the UK in 2018.",

      "bodyText": "Military rulers in Sudan signed an agreement with protesters on Wednesday to share power with civilian leaders. The deal comes after lengthy and difficult negotiations between generals who seized power after the fall of Omar al-Bashir in April and leaders of the pro-democracy campaign whose demonstrations led to the veteran dictator\u2019s fall. Analysts say it offers a chance to end months of political crisis and repeated bouts of violent repression, but that much will depend on further talks on the exact details and timing of any political transition. The two sides initialled a document called the \u201cpolitical declaration\u201d after intense talks through the night. The deputy chief of the ruling military council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo \u2013 who initialled the deal on behalf of the generals \u2013 said the agreement was a \u201chistoric moment\u201d for Sudan. \u201cI am pleased this morning to give this good news to the great Sudanese people \u2026 of the signing of the political agreement,\u201d Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, said on Wednesday morning. Ibrahim al-Amin, a key protest leader, confirmed that a declaration had been agreed, and that talks on a new constitution would resume on Friday. \u201cWe want a stable homeland, because we have suffered a great deal,\u201d he said. The outlines of the deal were agreed almost two weeks ago but the military repeatedly missed deadlines to sign. One point of contention during the negotiations was a demand from civilians that military leaders remain accountable for human rights abuses committed in recent months. In June, paramilitaries broke up a peaceful sit-in in Khartoum, the capital. More than 100 people died and many more were injured in the attack. There were also reports of scores of rapes. There have been further deaths and injuries since at the hands of security forces. The violence prompted international outrage, although Sudan\u2019s military rulers insisted they did not order the violent dispersal of protesters. Dagalo is the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), accused of committing the worst abuses in recent months. There are reports of continuing violent repression by the RSF. The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, an NGO, said the paramilitaries shot \u201cat peaceful civilians in the city of Omdurman\u201d on Tuesday, wounding three civilians. That Dagalo, officially only second in command, signed the agreement on behalf of the military rulers is being seen as a sign of his increasing power and influence. Opposition activists with knowledge of the talks told the Guardian that the signed deal includes provision for an independent and impartial investigation into the attack on the sit-in. \u201cThat was an absolute obligation for us. It is [a duty] owed to the martyrs and their families,\u201d said one activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Reaction in Khartoum to news of the deal, being brokered by African Union and Ethiopian mediators, was muted on Wednesday. There have been demonstrations in recent days calling for justice for those killed during the protests. Khalda Yacoub, a 27-year-old Khartoum-based English teacher and activist, said the deal would not stop \u201cthe killing of people in this country\u201d. \u201cThis is a political agreement, and there are divisions between the two sides. The problem is that the members of the [ruling military council] are part of the former regime and they need to change the way they deal with people,\u201d Yacoub said. Some were optimistic, however. Mohamed Eissa, 35, an engineer who moved to Khartoum from the Darfur region, said he was \u201cso happy\u201d. \u201cI think our crisis should only be solved politically,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea of having a radical change is impossible. This country is very fragile. I have worked in different places of Sudan and I know the amount of the weapons there are, so in our best interest is to reach to a deal.\u201d The agreement should lead to the establishment of a new transitional civilian-military ruling body which will comprise six civilians and five military representatives. The civilians will include five from the pro-democracy coalition the Alliance for Freedom and Change. A general will head the ruling body during the first 21 months of the transition, followed by a civilian for the remaining 18 months, according to the framework agreement. That body is to oversee the formation of a transitional civilian administration that will govern for just over three years, after which elections would be held. Harriet Baldwin, UK minister for Africa, welcomed a \u201cmomentous day for Sudan\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement is a step towards the change so bravely demanded by the Sudanese people. Everyone must be involved: men, women, young and old, from across Sudan,\u201d she said in a statement. Observers say however that many of the most difficult questions are yet to be settled and a transition to full civilian government is still extremely uncertain. The crisis has exacerbated a deteriorating economic situation, a consequence of 30 years of incompetent, corrupt and repressive rule by Bashir. Mahmud Dirir, an Ethiopian mediator of the deal, said Sudan needed to overcome poverty and called for the country to be taken off a U.S. list of states that support terrorism.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018We really shouldn\u2019t have left it so long, should we?\u201d asks Jimi Goodwin, halfway through what is only Doves\u2019 eighth show in almost a decade. The timing of the end of their hiatus \u2013 a nine-year silence during which Goodwin released his first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/20/jimi-goodwin-odludek-cd-review\">solo album</a>, and fraternal guitarist Jez and drummer Andy Williams started their own band, <a href=\"http://drownedinsound.com/releases/18639/reviews/4148692\">Black Rivers</a> \u2013 could almost be opportunistic. After all, the group were quickly recognised as the bards of the comedown when they surfaced at the start of the century \u2013 the former members of house pop act and Ha\u00e7ienda regulars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/18/sub-sub-aint-no-love-aint-no-use-feat-melanie-williams\">Sub Sub</a>, now playing post-party lullabies and cinematic, ruminative soundtracks to emotionally fragile morning-afters. Given that the nation \u2013 the world, even \u2013 has been on a colossal bummer for at least a couple of years, if ever there was a time for Doves\u2019 balmy, restorative pop to heal our nerves, it\u2019s now.</p> <p>But while there\u2019s a new album in the works, reports say, we hear none of it tonight; instead, we\u2019re treated to a greatest-hits set revisiting all four Doves albums, a trip that\u2019s unabashedly nostalgic, revelling in shared histories between artists and audience. They open with Firesuite, the chugging, gently spacey instrumental that opened their debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/07/favourite-album-lost-souls-doves\">Lost Souls</a>, and it plays out tonight like the krautrock equivalent of a warm cup of tea, never threatening to go truly cosmic \u2013 but then that\u2019s never been Doves\u2019 realm: they have always preferred to explore interior, emotional space.</p> <p>It was Goodwin who first staked out the soulful, warmly turbulent territory in indie rock later occupied by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/elbow\">Guy Garvey</a>, and crooning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZRgMaKi3Ko\">Sea Song</a> tonight, losing himself in its sleepless nightmares and its invitations to \u201cDrown in me\u201d, he spins melancholia into graceful grandeur. On the bleak Last Broadcast, as he sings \u201cYou can\u2019t escape yourself\u201d, the group make something sweet from the heartbreak, cradling Goodwin\u2019s lyric in aching melodies and ever-cresting basslines. This is what they used to call \u201cthe big music\u201d, but Goodwin keeps these windswept and dramatic moments grounded, his lyrics measured; he sings like an everyman, and his songs are more powerful for that.</p> <p>Doves are initially undercut, however, by the customarily wimpy Somerset House sound levels, in danger for the first several songs of being drowned out by moderate drunken conversation. \u201cTurn the guitarist up? Too fucking right!\u201d barks Goodwin several numbers in, after which everything gets a little more muscular; by the set\u2019s end, the taut space-rock of 10:03 is positively throbbing. But even at relatively sedate volume, Goodwin succeeds in tapping the euphoric undertow on which his downbeat anthems draw, and the grand choruses of their biggest songs become group singalongs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9472206485a1a238e8126ba46724613310a6bc81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9472206485a1a238e8126ba46724613310a6bc81/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doves at Somerset House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restorative pop \u2026 Doves at Somerset House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Ball/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the older tracks that most provoke these communal happy/sad moments, in particular the encore\u2019s one-two punch of The Cedar Room \u2013 their debut single, colossal Bonham-esque drums underpinning its slow-burn mantra \u2013 and There Goes the Fear, perhaps Doves\u2019 signature tune. Tonight, it sounds like Radiohead\u2019s No Surprises set to disco hi-hat, Goodwin weaving his generation\u2019s free-floating anxiety into something comforting and anthemic that draws people together. You wonder how many here have had their fried post-party minds soothed and guided back to safety by Doves\u2019 music over the years; certainly, it\u2019s a trick they\u2019ve pulled off again.</p> <p>They close with a daft run through Sub Sub\u2019s Space Face in honour of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/16/the-moon-landing-still-offers-hope-in-a-world-ruled-by-tiny-minds\">Apollo moon landings</a>. And while Doves\u2019 rumoured new material remains an unknown quantity tonight, the fresh fires they draw from the embers of their back catalogue confirm an audience beyond ready for their return.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.dovesmusicblog.com/2019-tour-dates/\">\u2022 Touring until 6 September.</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018We really shouldn\u2019t have left it so long, should we?\u201d asks Jimi Goodwin, halfway through what is only Doves\u2019 eighth show in almost a decade. The timing of the end of their hiatus \u2013 a nine-year silence during which Goodwin released his first solo album, and fraternal guitarist Jez and drummer Andy Williams started their own band, Black Rivers \u2013 could almost be opportunistic. After all, the group were quickly recognised as the bards of the comedown when they surfaced at the start of the century \u2013 the former members of house pop act and Ha\u00e7ienda regulars Sub Sub, now playing post-party lullabies and cinematic, ruminative soundtracks to emotionally fragile morning-afters. Given that the nation \u2013 the world, even \u2013 has been on a colossal bummer for at least a couple of years, if ever there was a time for Doves\u2019 balmy, restorative pop to heal our nerves, it\u2019s now. But while there\u2019s a new album in the works, reports say, we hear none of it tonight; instead, we\u2019re treated to a greatest-hits set revisiting all four Doves albums, a trip that\u2019s unabashedly nostalgic, revelling in shared histories between artists and audience. They open with Firesuite, the chugging, gently spacey instrumental that opened their debut album, Lost Souls, and it plays out tonight like the krautrock equivalent of a warm cup of tea, never threatening to go truly cosmic \u2013 but then that\u2019s never been Doves\u2019 realm: they have always preferred to explore interior, emotional space. It was Goodwin who first staked out the soulful, warmly turbulent territory in indie rock later occupied by Guy Garvey, and crooning Sea Song tonight, losing himself in its sleepless nightmares and its invitations to \u201cDrown in me\u201d, he spins melancholia into graceful grandeur. On the bleak Last Broadcast, as he sings \u201cYou can\u2019t escape yourself\u201d, the group make something sweet from the heartbreak, cradling Goodwin\u2019s lyric in aching melodies and ever-cresting basslines. This is what they used to call \u201cthe big music\u201d, but Goodwin keeps these windswept and dramatic moments grounded, his lyrics measured; he sings like an everyman, and his songs are more powerful for that. Doves are initially undercut, however, by the customarily wimpy Somerset House sound levels, in danger for the first several songs of being drowned out by moderate drunken conversation. \u201cTurn the guitarist up? Too fucking right!\u201d barks Goodwin several numbers in, after which everything gets a little more muscular; by the set\u2019s end, the taut space-rock of 10:03 is positively throbbing. But even at relatively sedate volume, Goodwin succeeds in tapping the euphoric undertow on which his downbeat anthems draw, and the grand choruses of their biggest songs become group singalongs. It\u2019s the older tracks that most provoke these communal happy/sad moments, in particular the encore\u2019s one-two punch of The Cedar Room \u2013 their debut single, colossal Bonham-esque drums underpinning its slow-burn mantra \u2013 and There Goes the Fear, perhaps Doves\u2019 signature tune. Tonight, it sounds like Radiohead\u2019s No Surprises set to disco hi-hat, Goodwin weaving his generation\u2019s free-floating anxiety into something comforting and anthemic that draws people together. You wonder how many here have had their fried post-party minds soothed and guided back to safety by Doves\u2019 music over the years; certainly, it\u2019s a trick they\u2019ve pulled off again. They close with a daft run through Sub Sub\u2019s Space Face in honour of the Apollo moon landings. And while Doves\u2019 rumoured new material remains an unknown quantity tonight, the fresh fires they draw from the embers of their back catalogue confirm an audience beyond ready for their return. \u2022 Touring until 6 September.",

      "bodyText": "A British holidaymaker could be paralysed for life after breaking his neck in an accident at a Spanish water park, his family fear. David Briffaut, 23, lost consciousness and suffered serious injuries after hitting the water in a pool at the bottom of a slide at the Aqualandia tourist attraction in Benidorm. He is on a life support machine in a Spanish hospital. His family fear he will be left paraplegic after scans showed he has two broken vertebrae in his neck. Briffaut\u2019s parents, Lorraine, a teacher, and Stephane, a construction worker, have flown out to bring him home once his condition is sufficiently stable. His uncle, Mark Pooley, said: \u201cThis is every family\u2019s worse nightmare. David is a wonderful young man who was enjoying an innocent day out with his girlfriend. \u201cWe are praying for a miracle, but we have been told that the injuries he has sustained are very traumatic \u2026 We are hoping that David\u2019s travel insurance will pay for him to be flown home, but after that he faces a very uncertain future. \u201cHe has undergone surgery and is partly conscious, but in a great deal of pain. We have been told he may need more surgery later this week.\u201d Briffaut, who works as a green keeper at a golf club in Essex, was on holiday with his girlfriend of six years, Penny Bristow, at the time of the accident on the \u201cSplash\u201d slide. They had been staying with friends and were on holiday to celebrate Bristow completing a degree course in travel and tourism. The slide is one of 15 rides at the water park and is graded \u201cmoderate\u201d. Pooley said: \u201cWe cannot understand how this happened at a family tourist destination. David was behaving in the normal way, and he had not been drinking. We believe there should be a full investigation into the circumstances of what happened.\u201d A crowdfunding page has been set up to raise \u00a375,000 to help pay for his care when he returns home. By Wednesday morning it had raised more than \u00a330,000. It says: \u201cWhat began as a fun day out ended in tragedy when David suffered his horrific injuries coming down a waterslide \u2026 We want to do everything within our capabilities to raise as much money as possible to enable David to get the best possible care and better his life in whatever way we can.\u201d Bristow shared the link on Facebook, writing: \u201cBreaks my heart having to share this but we would truly appreciate everyone\u2019s support in sharing and donating anything they can for David to get the care and support he needs. I love you so much, we will get through this.\u201d",

Wigs, then, are another way for individuals to change their look and keep followers interested \u2013 although no doubt some wigs will also fall victim to the \u201cwear it once\u201d approach.</p> <p>However, Akki does credit Instagram with breaking down \u201cso many of the stigmas that may have previously existed in fashion and beauty, especially for wigs\u201d. Wig wearing is no longer secret or subtle, but lauded as a means of being fashion-forward. The wig maker C\u00e9sar DeLe\u00f6n Ramir\u00eaz, who has worked on wigs for Jenner and Ciara, says that negative associations \u2013 such as the taboo of female baldness \u2013 are long gone: \u201cI wanted to diminish the stigmas that surrounded wig wearing.

There are tons of tutorials online \u2013 how to secure your wig, how to care for your wig, how to create a wig. Black women already wear wigs, it\u2019s commonplace within our culture. Also, the LGBTQIA community \u2013 particularly transgender women \u2013 have made wigs more acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor most trans men, a wig is not necessary, but for most trans women \u2013 especially those above a certain age \u2013 a wig is essential,\u201d says Dr Jane Hamlin, president of the Beaumont Society, a national self-help body run by and for the transgender community. \u201cSeveral wig suppliers advertise in our members\u2019 magazine and some attend events that are organised for the trans community, so that people can try them in an environment where they feel safe. When I started, I relied on mail order and bought wigs that were probably not the best choices for me.\u201d</p> <p>Ramir\u00eaz recognises that the growing popularity of wigs comes at a time when the natural hair movement has encouraged many women with afro locks to embrace their curls. Yet he is also keen to stress that the two trends can sit side by side.</p> <p>\u201cWigs were originally a form of protective hairstyling that allows natural hair to grow while avoiding heat or chemical damage,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary shield for someone in the natural hair movement.\u201d</p> <p>Drag acts, too, have had a role to play. Although drag errs towards the \u201ccostume\u201d end of the wig-wearing spectrum, it has also placed wigs and their aesthetic potential firmly in the spotlight.

Synthetic alternatives avoid this problem and are usually less costly, but cannot be heat-styled.

While awareness has increased around conditions such as alopecia, so too have the opportunities afforded by wigs as a fashion accessory. Karen cites wigs as a means of \u201cmood-enhancement dressing\u201d \u2013 where clothes (or in this case, hairpieces) optimise the mood of the wearer. Now that wearing a wig is no longer imbued with the same sense of shame at the possibility of being \u201cfound out\u201d, it can be an exhilarating experience, the chance to try different styles, and maybe even take on a more daring \u2013 albeit temporary \u2013 persona.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why many of us take a trip to the salon after a devastating breakup,\u201d says Forbes-Bell. \u201cA wig is even more appealing, as it allows you to experience that euphoric novelty, without having to plop yourself in a stylist\u2019s chair for two hours.\u201d</p>",

Despite these concerns, the fashion psychologist Shakaila Forbes-Bell believes the versatility afforded by wigs is one of the main reasons why they have become increasingly mainstream. \u201cStudies have shown that novel things, like a new hair colour or length, for example, activate the brain\u2019s pleasure centres, resulting in a flood of dopamine \u2013 the same chemical that is released when we eat good food and have great sex,\u201d she says. Wigs, then, offer a certain escapism; a chance to achieve the aesthetically unlikely or impossible. While awareness has increased around conditions such as alopecia, so too have the opportunities afforded by wigs as a fashion accessory. Karen cites wigs as a means of \u201cmood-enhancement dressing\u201d \u2013 where clothes (or in this case, hairpieces) optimise the mood of the wearer. Now that wearing a wig is no longer imbued with the same sense of shame at the possibility of being \u201cfound out\u201d, it can be an exhilarating experience, the chance to try different styles, and maybe even take on a more daring \u2013 albeit temporary \u2013 persona. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why many of us take a trip to the salon after a devastating breakup,\u201d says Forbes-Bell. \u201cA wig is even more appealing, as it allows you to experience that euphoric novelty, without having to plop yourself in a stylist\u2019s chair for two hours.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cLast week QPR sold Matt Smith to Millwall and signed another Matt Smith on loan from Manchester City \u2026 on the same day,\u201d writes Martyn Bryce. \u201cDo readers have other examples of such dealings with players of the same name.\u201d It doesn\u2019t happen often Martyn, but there are some examples. Ryan Geraghty takes us back a year to the north-west of England to get the ball rolling. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will have a few readers responding with this one: I recall last summer Reece James \u2013 formerly of Manchester United \u2013 being released by Wigan only for Wigan to sign Reece James on loan from Chelsea. I didn\u2019t suspect he would go on to be their player of the season and now be linked with Crystal Palace, but the name stuck in my mind. And, of course, there were the Demb\u00e9l\u00e9s at Fulham.\u201d Indeed there were, Ryan. Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 checked in at Craven Cottage on 15 July 2012, and there was already a Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 on the books. He was promptly sold to Tottenham the following month, perhaps after having his style cramped by his younger almost identically-named new teammate. \u201cIn 1992 Coventry City had Paul Williams and Paul Williams (on loan) playing behind John Williams,\u201d writes the one and only Andy Masters. \u201cWe also had Mickys Gynn and Quinn, and Sean Flynn. A year later, Paul Williams was sold and replaced by a third Paul Williams.\u201d \u201cSouthend United were linked with Jack Payne for a while, after selling Jack Payne to Huddersfield,\u201d pipes up Navin Patel, who thinks there may have been a headline-grabbing motive behind it. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how serious the link was \u2026 I suspect Phil Brown saw an opportunity to get his name in the papers and went for it.\u201d Charbel Boujaoude has wound the clock back just the 116 years to bring us this fine example of a Robertson overload: \u201cI have a suggestion from my youth,\u201d quips Charbel. \u201cBack in 1903, in the space of a few days, Manchester United signed two players called Alexander Robertson. One came from Hibernian and went by Alex, the other from Middlesbrough and had to answer to Sandy, to ease the confusion. But, to add to the confusion, United also signed Tom Robertson in this same three-day period, making it three Robertson purchases together.\u201d And not strictly a transfer, but Mali did replace goalscoring Adama Traor\u00e9 with another Adama Traor\u00e9 in the Africa Cup of Nations group stages \u2013 and he only went and scored. Outfield players wearing trousers \u201cWho was the last outfielder to wear trousers whilst playing,\u201d tweets Ben Jones. It\u2019s taken an Australian playing in the frozen east to provide an answer. Over to you, Russell Connor: \u201cLeeds\u2019s away leg against Spartak Moscow in the 1999 Uefa Cup couldn\u2019t take place due to a frozen pitch and -20C conditions, so the game was moved to Bulgaria. However, it was still cold enough for Harry Kewell to wear tracksuit bottoms under his normal kit. I remember most of the Leeds players were wearing gloves that night, though captain Gary Kelly was wearing short sleeves.\u201d Anyone else for tennis? Last week we trawled through the archives to find the select few footballers who have also played tennis to a professional standard. We missed some. \u201cTry to top Karel Kozeluh in versatility,\u201d writes Erich Pl\u00f6chl. \u201cHe played football for both the Austrian and the Czechoslovakian national teams (winning four and two caps respectively), won the professional tennis championships in the US and France and added a European championship in ice hockey as well.\u201d OK, we\u2019ll try Erich. \u201cI\u2019d like to draw your attention to Max Woosnam,\u201d writes Nathan Ratcliffe. \u201cAn extract from his Wikipedia page states: \u2018Among his achievements were winning an Olympic gold and silver in tennis at the 1920 Summer Olympics, winning the doubles at Wimbledon, compiling a 147 break in snooker, making a century at Lord\u2019s, captaining the British Davis Cup team, captaining Manchester City FC finishing ultimately runners-up for the Football League Championship in 1920\u201321 and captaining the England national football team.\u2019 Mr Woosnam ticks more boxes than pretty much any man ever has.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cLast week there were five Athens-based teams playing in European competition,\u201d wrote Michael Dunn many moons ago in November 2004. \u201cOlympiakos and Panathinaikos in the Champions League, and AEK Athens, Panionios and Egaleo in the Uefa Cup.

      "bodyText": "The mother of teenager Alex Ross-King, who died from MDMA toxicity at a music festival in January, has called on the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to show \u201ccourage\u201d by introducing measures to help stop further drug deaths. On Wednesday, outside a NSW coronial hearing into six MDMA-related deaths at music festivals, Jennie Ross-King called on the state government to \u201cshow the same courage as these group of parents has, who have lost a daughter or a son\u201d. \u201cIt needs to stop here,\u201d she said. \u201cI say this to the premier; premier, thank you for your sympathies. This inquest has bought nothing up in relation to these tragedies for us \u2013 we live with this everyday, it doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d She asked the premier to implement changes to drug policy to \u201ckeep our festivalgoers, as a start, safe\u201d. \u201cAnd ensure no other parent, brother, sister, family or friend must ever endure the unmeasurable anguish we have, and to again make Australia world leaders in harm minimisation,\u201d she said. The court heard on Wednesday that Ross-King sent a string of increasingly desperate text messages to friends asking for help in the lead up to her death. The inquest heard that after \u201cdouble-dunking\u201d \u2013 taking two pills at once \u2013 before entering the Fomo festival in Parramatta earlier this year, Ross-King, 19, danced with friends and posed in videos. By mid-afternoon though she had become separated from her friends, and in the hours before she died sent a number of text messages asking for help. Between 3.34pm and 3.39pm, the court heard, she sent three messages: \u201cFucksake I just want to find youse,\u201d she wrote first. \u201cBro can some just me from under the tree. \u201cPlease someone.\u201d The inquest has previously heard that Ross-King took an unusually high amount of MDMA before arriving at the venue because she was afraid of being caught with the drugs by police. As the afternoon went on and her friends looked for her, she sent a number of jumbled and increasingly incoherent texts, including about the presence of drug dogs at the festival. The court heard evidence from a friend \u2013 who cannot be named \u2013 who found Ross-King about 20 minutes later. She was, the friend said, complaining of being extremely hot and taking short, quick breaths. \u201cAlex told me a number of times, \u201cI\u2019m fucked up\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m hot,\u201d the friend said in her statement. Conditions inside the Fomo festival, the coroner\u2019s court heard, were extremely hot. Ross-King\u2019s friend said it was \u201cso hot you didn\u2019t want to move, you know when it\u2019s so hot you can\u2019t really breathe\u201d. For that reason Ross-King\u2019s condition initially didn\u2019t strike her as concerning. \u201cI just felt like, oh, me too, I was the same,\u201d she said. But after taking Ross-King to find shade and water, her condition worsened. She stopped listening to her friend, started to walk slowly, said her legs weren\u2019t working properly, and had her arms up near her chest with her fists near her mouth. She was eventually spotted by a roving medical officer after she bumped into another group of people and fell over. Despite resisting, the officer and another of Ross-King\u2019s friends got her to a medical tent, where the court heard she was \u201cscreaming, kicking out with her legs and in distress\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The deputy state coroner, Harriet Grahame, is examining the deaths of Nathan Tran, 18, Diana Nguyen, 21, Joseph Pham, 23, Callum Brosnan, 19, Joshua Tam, 22, and Ross-King, 19, who all died from MDMA toxicity or complications of MDMA use at music festivals between December 2017 and January 2019. Earlier on Wednesday the inquest heard evidence that alcohol was the drug associated with the most problematic rates of use. A study, released on Wednesday by the RMIT university drug researcher Monica Barratt, found 6% of Australian festivalgoers who had taken drugs in the past 12 months had sought medical treatment. Of those, 4.3 per 100 people who drank alcohol reported receiving medical treatment, compared with 2.5 who consumed MDMA and 1.48 for LSD. Barratt told the inquest that in the case of MDMA the median quantity consumed before seeking medical treatment was three pills or caps, although most of those people mixed their MDMA use with other illicit drugs or alcohol. Based on responses from 4,391 Australian festivalgoers as part of the 2019 Global Drug Survey, Barrett told the inquest that for those seeking medical treatment after drinking alcohol the median amount of drinks consumed was 15. The Global Drug Survey does not measure the prevalence of drug use in the wider community \u2013 since its respondents are more likely to have taken a legal or illicit substance. A separate study also released on Wednesday by the criminologist Caitlin Hughes \u2013 also based on the Global Drug Survey \u2013 found the most commonly used drugs among Australian music festival attendees were alcohol, MDMA, cannabis and cocaine, reported by 96.6%, 79.5%, 74.0% and 69.1% of the sample respectively in the last 12 months. \u201cWhile we\u2019re focusing on MDMA, alcohol is the drug that is associated with most problematic rates of use,\u201d Hughes told the inquest. \u201cSo particularly when combined with Dr Barratt\u2019s research, it shows the importance of considering poly-drug (multi-drug) consumption ... particularly to reduce alcohol consumption at these settings.\u201d Barratt\u2019s study concluded that risks associated with MDMA use \u2013 including mixing substances, taking large doses or not knowing the purity of a dose \u2013 could be prevented, and that some of the harms around MDMA related to \u201cthe lack of regulation of supply\u201d of the drug. \u201cWhen you talk to young people about the possibility of consuming novel substances that they had no intention of consuming ... most people would prefer to use MDMA and would prefer to use a known dose,\u201d she said. Barratt said regulation of the supply of the drug \u201ccould prevent some of the harms\u201d associated with the drug, and pointed to research in the US looking to use MDMA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem [because] there are idiosyncratic reactions to a normal dose of MDMA that we see in the literature so ... it\u2019s not possible to say MDMA is safe, it\u2019s not that simple,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can say that the safety profile of pharmaceutical-grade MDMA when provided in a quiet room with good ventilation and a counsellor is something that has reached stage-three trials and is seen as an effective treatment for trauma.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Since the end of the Women\u2019s World Cup, the US women\u2019s national team have been celebrating in jubilant and brilliant fashion. They have chanted \u201cequal pay!\u201d from atop floats at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/10/us-womens-soccer-team-world-cup-champions-new-york-parade\">ticker-tape parade in New York City</a> beneath showers of confetti made from shredded copies of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">gender-equity lawsuit</a> against the US Soccer Federation and appeared on a raft of chat shows, lending an unprecedented mainstream platform for their campaign of justice for women in football.</p> <p>Their uproarious Instagram presence led by goalkeeper <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ashlyn-harris-allie-long-pay-us-bitch_n_5d261979e4b0583e482aebbd\">Ashlyn Harris</a>, who has shared various moments from their celebrations in real time, has become the stuff of legend, stuffing any and all complaints back into the dark abyss of jealousy and sexism: that the American women are too bold and arrogant in expressing their happiness and political opinions <a href=\"https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/alex-morgan-tea-celebration-uswnt-england-womens-world-cup-070319\">on the pitch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/everyones-new-soccer-hero-megan-rapinoe-is-actually-kind-of-awful\">off</a>.</p> <p>But not all has been shiny and flawless in the wake of the USWNT\u2019s triumph, and it\u2019s important to look at how the team\u2019s identity is being co-opted by those with disingenuous agendas. Consider the veteran forward Christen Press, who took over the Instagram account for Barstool during last week\u2019s parade to share a few videos of herself and her teammates celebrating.</p> <p>It was head-scratching that Press would partner with an outlet like Barstool, an incredibly popular US sports website. Barstool has also been the center of controversy for recurring features including but not limited to \u201cGuess that Ass\u201d, \u201cGuess that Rack\u201d and \u201cGrading the Newest Sex Scandal Teacher\u201d. They are infamous for unleashing their army of fans, who call themselves \u201cStoolies\u201d, on <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/trolls-ripped-me-after-i-tweeted-barstool-sports-dave-portnoy-is-a-disease-i-stand-by-it/2019/03/10/757902b0-41ff-11e9-9361-301ffb5bd5e6_story.html?utm_term=.66c3459bf339\">any person who deigns to criticize them</a>. When Robert Silverman published a feature <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-barstool-sports-culture-of-online-hate-they-treat-sexual-harassment-and-cyberbullying-as-a-game\">on their culture of vicious harassment</a> and how their <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/barstool-sports-stole-from-her-then-the-insidious-harassment-began\">disregard for women\u2019s work is unparalleled</a> for the Daily Beast, his personal information was doxxed and he found himself the target of online attacks. So <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/barstool-sports-shuts-down-comment-section-silencing-i-1831688120\">infested with racist epithets</a> were reader comments at the bottom of Barstool\u2019s posts, the company shut down the feedback section completely. As someone knee-deep in the industry, it is an outlet that I know to be toxic and that should be avoided.</p> <p>Suffice it to say that Barstool is not a place that fosters positive discussion. A smorgasbord of vacuous, <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/barstool-sports-stooges-try-to-explain-why-corey-lewand-1827035909\">white dudebro-centered</a> coverage is not exactly aligned with the inclusive, empowering messages espoused by the world champions.</p> <p>How Press, a woman of color from a team that propagates understanding, love and unity, could align herself with Barstool is baffling. Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/02/uswnt-rbg-beyonce-jerseys-england\">USWNT chose women who they honored</a> by putting their names on the back of their kits. Press chose black feminist <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/sojourner-truth\">Sojourner Truth</a>, a woman who showed us to look holistically at the world, understand the toxicity that affects it, examine it critically and act accordingly.</p> <p>I have wracked my brain thinking about how this partnership might have been hatched. Of course not every player from a diverse group of 23 will be in lockstep socio-politically, but Barstool\u2019s extended history of misogynistic behavior is so antithetical to what the USWNT represent it demands closer inspection.</p> <p>It is possible that Press does not know of Barstool\u2019s vile reputation. Perhaps she was totally unaware of the levels of casual racism and misogyny that fester and are regurgitated at Barstool under the guise of \u201canti-PC culture\u201d or \u201csatire\u201d. It is possible that she was exhausted after a long, hard World Cup, and her PR team at <a href=\"http://www.eagsportsmanagement.com/eag-staff/\">EAG Sports Management</a> advised her incorrectly based on a business model they deemed profitable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d687a157b238da6de8ec07978321e60617010ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d687a157b238da6de8ec07978321e60617010ef/0_0_603_775/389.jpg\" alt=\"Barstool\" width=\"389\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barstool was not shy about gloating over their improbable partnership with Press, one of the US women\u2019s national team\u2019s biggest stars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe EAG thought it was business not personal. But the USWNT has made it explicitly clear that their business <em>is</em> personal.</p> <p>It is possible, if unlikely, that Press might have felt her presence could have positively affected a misogynist cesspool of trash. Or there is the chance that she was very handsomely compensated for her time.</p> <p>All this is conjecture on my part, since Press has not addressed it despite numerous requests for comment from the Guardian and other outlets through both US Soccer and her personal handlers. Deadspin\u2019s Tom Ley reported that Aaron Heifetz, the press officer for the US women\u2019s team, <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/uswnt-press-officer-on-christen-presss-barstool-sports-1836316531?utm_medium=sharefromsite&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_campaign=bottom\">seemed puzzled by the collaboration</a>, admitting Press \u201cdoes not seem like someone who would even remotely now what Barstool Sports is or follow them\u201d.</p> <p>The most difficult thing is to grapple with is the deafening silence. Were Press to say, \u201cit\u2019s none of your business\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI regret it\u201d, it would help those of us that want to prop up the entire USWNT team and who support what they stand for. At least we would know.</p> <p>The worst consequence of this undesirable collaboration is the way Barstool have used it in a transparent attempt to whitewash their misogynist past, holding it up as a denial that they are sexist and crude. Kayce Smith, a female Barstool staffer, declared that \u201cThe USWNT Loves Barstool\u201d, co-opting a brand many women\u2019s soccer supporters respect to wash away their own past. Even when their company president <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barstool-sports-rape-joke_n_1293328\">Dave Portnoy once declared</a>: \u201cEven though I never condone rape if you\u2019re a size 6 and you\u2019re wearing skinny jeans you kind of deserve to be raped right?\u201d</p> <p>As a woman of color sports journalist, who supports women\u2019s soccer beyond the stars and stripes, this was disappointing.</p> <p>It is no surprise that Barstool Sports would appropriate this gesture and peddle a narrative that the USWNT, and thus women, \u201clove\u201d them.

      "bodyText": "Since the end of the Women\u2019s World Cup, the US women\u2019s national team have been celebrating in jubilant and brilliant fashion. They have chanted \u201cequal pay!\u201d from atop floats at a ticker-tape parade in New York City beneath showers of confetti made from shredded copies of their gender-equity lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation and appeared on a raft of chat shows, lending an unprecedented mainstream platform for their campaign of justice for women in football. Their uproarious Instagram presence led by goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris, who has shared various moments from their celebrations in real time, has become the stuff of legend, stuffing any and all complaints back into the dark abyss of jealousy and sexism: that the American women are too bold and arrogant in expressing their happiness and political opinions on the pitch and off. But not all has been shiny and flawless in the wake of the USWNT\u2019s triumph, and it\u2019s important to look at how the team\u2019s identity is being co-opted by those with disingenuous agendas. Consider the veteran forward Christen Press, who took over the Instagram account for Barstool during last week\u2019s parade to share a few videos of herself and her teammates celebrating. It was head-scratching that Press would partner with an outlet like Barstool, an incredibly popular US sports website. Barstool has also been the center of controversy for recurring features including but not limited to \u201cGuess that Ass\u201d, \u201cGuess that Rack\u201d and \u201cGrading the Newest Sex Scandal Teacher\u201d. They are infamous for unleashing their army of fans, who call themselves \u201cStoolies\u201d, on any person who deigns to criticize them. When Robert Silverman published a feature on their culture of vicious harassment and how their disregard for women\u2019s work is unparalleled for the Daily Beast, his personal information was doxxed and he found himself the target of online attacks. So infested with racist epithets were reader comments at the bottom of Barstool\u2019s posts, the company shut down the feedback section completely. As someone knee-deep in the industry, it is an outlet that I know to be toxic and that should be avoided. Suffice it to say that Barstool is not a place that fosters positive discussion. A smorgasbord of vacuous, white dudebro-centered coverage is not exactly aligned with the inclusive, empowering messages espoused by the world champions. How Press, a woman of color from a team that propagates understanding, love and unity, could align herself with Barstool is baffling. Earlier this year, the USWNT chose women who they honored by putting their names on the back of their kits. Press chose black feminist Sojourner Truth, a woman who showed us to look holistically at the world, understand the toxicity that affects it, examine it critically and act accordingly. I have wracked my brain thinking about how this partnership might have been hatched. Of course not every player from a diverse group of 23 will be in lockstep socio-politically, but Barstool\u2019s extended history of misogynistic behavior is so antithetical to what the USWNT represent it demands closer inspection. It is possible that Press does not know of Barstool\u2019s vile reputation. Perhaps she was totally unaware of the levels of casual racism and misogyny that fester and are regurgitated at Barstool under the guise of \u201canti-PC culture\u201d or \u201csatire\u201d. It is possible that she was exhausted after a long, hard World Cup, and her PR team at EAG Sports Management advised her incorrectly based on a business model they deemed profitable. Maybe EAG thought it was business not personal. But the USWNT has made it explicitly clear that their business is personal. It is possible, if unlikely, that Press might have felt her presence could have positively affected a misogynist cesspool of trash. Or there is the chance that she was very handsomely compensated for her time. All this is conjecture on my part, since Press has not addressed it despite numerous requests for comment from the Guardian and other outlets through both US Soccer and her personal handlers. Deadspin\u2019s Tom Ley reported that Aaron Heifetz, the press officer for the US women\u2019s team, seemed puzzled by the collaboration, admitting Press \u201cdoes not seem like someone who would even remotely now what Barstool Sports is or follow them\u201d. The most difficult thing is to grapple with is the deafening silence. Were Press to say, \u201cit\u2019s none of your business\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI regret it\u201d, it would help those of us that want to prop up the entire USWNT team and who support what they stand for. At least we would know. The worst consequence of this undesirable collaboration is the way Barstool have used it in a transparent attempt to whitewash their misogynist past, holding it up as a denial that they are sexist and crude. Kayce Smith, a female Barstool staffer, declared that \u201cThe USWNT Loves Barstool\u201d, co-opting a brand many women\u2019s soccer supporters respect to wash away their own past. Even when their company president Dave Portnoy once declared: \u201cEven though I never condone rape if you\u2019re a size 6 and you\u2019re wearing skinny jeans you kind of deserve to be raped right?\u201d As a woman of color sports journalist, who supports women\u2019s soccer beyond the stars and stripes, this was disappointing. It is no surprise that Barstool Sports would appropriate this gesture and peddle a narrative that the USWNT, and thus women, \u201clove\u201d them. Rose Lavelle, has also appeared on a Barstool podcast in the past, and a number of prominent USWNT players follow the company\u2019s Instagram account, including Abby Dahlkemper, Mal Pugh, Allie Long, Carli Lloyd, Ali Krieger, Ashlyn Harris, Julie Ertz, Emily Sonnett and Alyssa Naeher. A follow does not necessarily mean they promote or support their work. What\u2019s that old adage? RTs are not endorsements. Best-case scenario: Christen Press truly had no idea about what Barstool represents and her publicist is waiting for everyone to forget about this serious misstep. But if Press is a \u201cStoolie\u201d, while continuing to speak about intersectionality and feminism, I\u2019m going to take a step back and hope that her team of advisors, friends and teammates can perhaps enlighten her. This is a moment for her and others to (un)learn. That\u2019s what growth is. And we all need to do it. There is no one way to justice, and the path of activism is wide. But rape apologia, white privilege, toxic misogyny and Barstool Sports are not things I associate with the truth and justice the US team claim to fight for. EAG Sports Management and US Soccer did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian. This article was amended on 17 July 2019.

A report that year by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\">Shami Chakrabarti</a>&nbsp;exonerated the party of widespread antisemitism but reported an 'occasionally toxic atmosphere'.</p>\n    <p>Matters escalated in 2018 when it became evident that the party was receiving more and more complaints, to the extent that there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/jewish-labour-group-accuses-failing-act-antisemitism\">backlog of disciplinary cases</a>. Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/corbyn-sorry-for-hurt-inflicted-on-jewish-people-by-antisemitism-row-labour\">apologised that April</a>&nbsp;for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the process and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.</p>\n    <p>But the party was also mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\">ended up ultimately approving</a>. Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>. Then Chris Williamson, a Labour MP and ally of Corbyn, caused an outcry for saying that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/27/chris-williamson-says-labour-has-been-too-apologetic-about-antisemitism-video\">&nbsp;the party had been 'too apologetic' about antisemitism complaints</a>. However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated. Then came the announcement that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission was placing the party&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under formal investigation</a>&nbsp;over antisemitism.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What allegations were made in the BBC Panorama documentary?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In a July 2019 programme, eight whistleblowers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">spoke to a BBC Panorama documentary</a>, with some saying they felt there was political meddling from Corbyn\u2019s office in the process for handling antisemitism complaints. Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\">who was eventually expelled from the party</a>.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Labour\u2019s response to the BBC\u2019s Panorama?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">strongly denied the allegations</a>&nbsp;of political interference, and came out on the offensive, accusing the BBC of bias and calling for the documentary to be pulled. A Labour spokesman said the party had fully answered \u201ca number of questions\u201d put to it by the programme, and had also sent 50 pages of documents in response. The complaints to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a>&nbsp;had been made \u201cat various levels, including the director general\u201d.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a>,</b>&nbsp;<i>Deputy political editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I never thought I would become a victim of Jew hatred from the hard left. I never dreamed that one year on the situation within the party would so dramatically deteriorate and that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/labour-staffers-letter-jeremy-corbyn-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">antisemitism crisis in Labour</a> would spiral out of control. In the last month I have been accused of being an operative for the Israeli embassy. Conspiracy theorists accuse me of running a cartel of \u201cNazi rabbis\u201d and say that Jeremy Corbyn is the \u201cfinal solution\u201d to the Zionist question. I receive shameful attacks seeking to question my Jewish identity and express doubt about my family\u2019s suffering under the Nazis.</p> \n<p>Hateful language has now become part of mainstream political discourse. Antisemitism always existed on both the extreme right and the extreme left fringes. But under Corbynism it has been allowed to flourish in the mainstream.</p> \n<p>The Labour party should be the natural home for Jews with its historic commitment to fighting racism, promoting equality and fostering international solidarity. Instead, it has become a hostile place. So much so that many Jews and lifelong activists have left the party, forced out by the toxic antisemitic culture.</p> \n<p>Last week saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/labour-struggles-with-resignations-bad-polls-and-attacks\" title=\"\">departure of three Labour grandees</a> from the House of Lords, including a former general secretary. A BBC Panorama programme featured young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/jul/10/four-whistleblowers-speak-of-top-labour-aides-interfering-in-antisemitism-investigations-video\" title=\"\">Labour activists and workers</a>, the very people who should form Labour\u2019s future but whose aspirations and hopes have been crushed by antisemitism and bullying in the Labour party. We saw a frightening display of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/corbyn-decries-bbcs-inaccuracies-over-labour-antisemitism\" title=\"\">deliberate denial by the party leadership</a>. The way they have intimidated those calling out Jew hate echoes many of the dangerous populist forces that have surged across the west.</p> \n<p>Over the last year the list of revelations of Corbyn\u2019s personal association with antisemitism has only grown. His coded language about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/24/corbyn-english-irony-video-reignites-antisemitism-row-labour\" title=\"\">\u201cEnglish irony\u201d</a> after being heckled by Jewish people at an event. His attendance at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-not-involved-munich-olympics-massacre-wreath-laying\" title=\"\">wreath-laying ceremony</a> for anti-Israel terrorists. His overlooking antisemitism when he penned a foreword for a book. Further examples of controversial figures with whom he shared a platform. All have reinforced the view I expressed last July about Corbyn\u2019s character and beliefs.</p> \n<p>The claims by the leader\u2019s entourage that the complaints process has improved are laughable. In February I met with Jeremy. I put to him the allegation that his office was intervening in individual cases and corrupting the complaints process, seeking to protect Corbyn supporters from accusations of antisemitism.</p> \n<p>I was given absolute assurances that there was no political interference. Yet, soon after, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/06/corbyn-staff-asked-to-be-copied-in-on-antisemitism-complaints-leak-shows\" title=\"\">leaked emails</a> in the Observer and the Sunday Times showed regular meddling by the leader\u2019s office. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\" title=\"\">Panorama programme</a> last week confirmed the extent and depth of political interference. Seeing those young party members driven to desperation was sickening. Yet still the party claims \u201cit\u2019s all under control\u201d.</p> \n<p>When party staff decided to blow the whistle, the leadership responded by trying to silence them with expensive lawyers. That is an abuse of power. As chair of the public accounts committee I saw PricewaterhouseCoopers treat whistleblowers responsible for the Luxembourg leaks on tax avoidance in precisely the same manner. It\u2019s how HSBC reacted when their employee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/27/hsbc-whistleblower-jailed-five-years-herve-falciani\" title=\"\">Herv\u00e9 Falciani</a> gave us the Swiss bank leaks showing aggressive tax avoidance and evasion.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0859d1126cfc50532fb303ef879633491dc4883b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0859d1126cfc50532fb303ef879633491dc4883b/0_65_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman takes part in an antisemitism demonstration in Parliament Square\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Many Jews and lifelong activists have left the party, forced out by the toxic antisemitic culture.\u2019 A woman protests in Parliament Square.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Reflecting on other events in the last year provides further evidence of the deteriorating culture. The election of Peter Willsman \u2013 who was caught calling 68 British rabbis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/31/corbyn-ally-says-jewish-trump-fanatics-make-up-antisemitism-claims\" title=\"\">\u201cTrump fanatics\u201d</a> \u2013 to the NEC.

All of these examples demonstrate the normalisation of Jew hatred in my party.</p> \n<p>But I will not walk away. I am often asked why I stay. My response is 57 years. That\u2019s how long I have been a Labour party member and for 54 years it has been one of the greatest relationships of my life. Three bad years versus 54 good ones.

      "bodyText": "Today marks one year since my face-to-face encounter with Jeremy Corbyn in the lobby of parliament in which I called him a racist and an antisemite. Afterwards I went out for the evening and switched off my phone. It was late that night when I switched it back on again and realised our confrontation had hit the headlines. The next morning I was in the dentist\u2019s chair with painful toothache when Luciana Berger rang to say that the Labour party was about to initiate disciplinary action against me. I did not appreciate that fighting antisemitism on the left would become such a central part of everyday life. Although I am a secular Jew and a critic of the Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, my politics have become defined by my Jewish identity in a way I never imagined they would. I never thought I would become a victim of Jew hatred from the hard left. I never dreamed that one year on the situation within the party would so dramatically deteriorate and that the antisemitism crisis in Labour would spiral out of control. In the last month I have been accused of being an operative for the Israeli embassy. Conspiracy theorists accuse me of running a cartel of \u201cNazi rabbis\u201d and say that Jeremy Corbyn is the \u201cfinal solution\u201d to the Zionist question. I receive shameful attacks seeking to question my Jewish identity and express doubt about my family\u2019s suffering under the Nazis. Hateful language has now become part of mainstream political discourse. Antisemitism always existed on both the extreme right and the extreme left fringes. But under Corbynism it has been allowed to flourish in the mainstream. The Labour party should be the natural home for Jews with its historic commitment to fighting racism, promoting equality and fostering international solidarity. Instead, it has become a hostile place. So much so that many Jews and lifelong activists have left the party, forced out by the toxic antisemitic culture. Last week saw the departure of three Labour grandees from the House of Lords, including a former general secretary. A BBC Panorama programme featured young Labour activists and workers, the very people who should form Labour\u2019s future but whose aspirations and hopes have been crushed by antisemitism and bullying in the Labour party. We saw a frightening display of deliberate denial by the party leadership. The way they have intimidated those calling out Jew hate echoes many of the dangerous populist forces that have surged across the west. Over the last year the list of revelations of Corbyn\u2019s personal association with antisemitism has only grown. His coded language about \u201cEnglish irony\u201d after being heckled by Jewish people at an event. His attendance at a wreath-laying ceremony for anti-Israel terrorists. His overlooking antisemitism when he penned a foreword for a book. Further examples of controversial figures with whom he shared a platform. All have reinforced the view I expressed last July about Corbyn\u2019s character and beliefs. The claims by the leader\u2019s entourage that the complaints process has improved are laughable. In February I met with Jeremy. I put to him the allegation that his office was intervening in individual cases and corrupting the complaints process, seeking to protect Corbyn supporters from accusations of antisemitism. I was given absolute assurances that there was no political interference. Yet, soon after, leaked emails in the Observer and the Sunday Times showed regular meddling by the leader\u2019s office. The Panorama programme last week confirmed the extent and depth of political interference. Seeing those young party members driven to desperation was sickening. Yet still the party claims \u201cit\u2019s all under control\u201d. When party staff decided to blow the whistle, the leadership responded by trying to silence them with expensive lawyers. That is an abuse of power. As chair of the public accounts committee I saw PricewaterhouseCoopers treat whistleblowers responsible for the Luxembourg leaks on tax avoidance in precisely the same manner. It\u2019s how HSBC reacted when their employee Herv\u00e9 Falciani gave us the Swiss bank leaks showing aggressive tax avoidance and evasion. Reflecting on other events in the last year provides further evidence of the deteriorating culture. The election of Peter Willsman \u2013 who was caught calling 68 British rabbis \u201cTrump fanatics\u201d \u2013 to the NEC. The attempt to reinstate Chris Williamson MP \u2013 who has a string of antisemitic offences to his name \u2013 to the Labour party. The selection of a Labour candidate in the Peterborough byelection who has liked a Facebook post that accused Theresa May of pursuing a \u201cZionist slave masters agenda\u201d. All of these examples demonstrate the normalisation of Jew hatred in my party. But I will not walk away. I am often asked why I stay. My response is 57 years. That\u2019s how long I have been a Labour party member and for 54 years it has been one of the greatest relationships of my life. Three bad years versus 54 good ones. That\u2019s worth fighting for. It\u2019s hard and frustrating, but I am resolute that my job is to keep calling out antisemitism. I will continue to campaign for a completely independent complaints process free of political corruption. I will work with others for a rule change so that offenders face immediate expulsion from the Labour party. I will argue for a zero-tolerance approach in what we do, not simply in what we say. Antisemitism is deeply damaging to the Labour party. But fighting to eradicate it is central to upholding the values on which the Labour movement was founded. Denying its existence or pretending to solve it behind closed doors will not do. It\u2019s not our calling out antisemitism that is destroying Labour; it\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s failure to act that is threatening our great party\u2019s future. We are running out of time. \u2022 Margaret Hodge is the Labour MP for Barking",

Currently in the Spanish capital to cough for the doctor at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid ahead of his \u00a320m move, Kieran Trippier could soon be joined by his Tottenham teammate Christian Eriksen. The Danish playmaker has made no secret of his desire to leave Spurs and now that Real\u2019s interest has cooled, Atl\u00e9tico are prepared to draw the curtain on his six-year spell in London. Danny Rose is also likely to be ushered to the door marked \u201cDo One\u201d following his omission from the Tottenham squad bound for a pre-season tour of Asia. While there are few if any whispers of any concrete offers for the left-back, he is believed to favour a move well north of the Watford Gap. With so many parking spaces being freed up at Tottenham\u2019s training ground, Giovani Lo Celso will be able to take his pick should Tottenham make an offer that Real Betis find acceptable. Spurs have already offered \u00a335m for the 23-year-old Argentinian, an amount which fell well short of his club\u2019s \u00a389m valuation. Aston Villa\u2019s attempts to add Kalvin Phillips to their long list of summer recruits could be stymied if reports that the young Leeds midfielder is set to sign a new deal that will keep him at Elland Road are to be believed. Meanwhile in Newcastle, Swiss defender Fabian Sch\u00e4r is wanted by Milan, who have been priced out of moves for Dejan Lovren and Dayot Upamecano from Liverpool and RB Leipzig respectively. Milan are also hitching their skirts in the direction of Luka Modric and will be first in with an offer should Real Madrid decide to sell the Croatian. The Argus report that a Brighton club \u201cinsider\u201d has rubbished claims Leicester City have agreed to pay an eye-watering \u00a345m for central defender Lewis Dunk. Reports of the imminent departure of winger Anthony Knockaert to Fulham seem far more plausible and the Frenchman could move for \u00a315m. Brighton are also interested in signing Brentford midfielder Neal Maupay, who is also wanted by Aston Villa, Sheffield United and West Brom. And finally, hot-headed Southampton striker Charlie Austin has deactivated his Twitter account amid reports in the Sun that he went off on an epic dressing-room rant at his manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. Having recently turned down the opportunity to move to West Brom, Austin is said to have lost the plot after being told he would be staying at home to train with the kids while his teammates go gallivanting around Maucau on pre-season.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s Monday in the Adirondack state park. I\u2019m driving through little towns, passing junk stores, lumber businesses, small cafes and adventure outfitters. I have heard people call this part of New York state \u201cpoverty with a view\u201d. The Adirondacks are a collision of hardship and wealth, but mostly wilderness. Six million acres of it.</p> <p>It\u2019s almost LaBastille Day, and to celebrate, I\u2019m going to camp alone for the first time in my life.</p> <p>Dr Anne LaBastille was, in her words, a part-time hermit. She died 1 July 2011, and her last name calls to Bastille Day, a celebration of independence. A wildlife ecologist, writer and photographer, she built her own 12x12 cabin on Twitchell Lake after her divorce in 1964. She chronicled her life and research in more than a dozen books, including the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/133718-woodswoman\">Woodswoman series</a>.</p> <p>She wrote that her remote cabin was \u201cthe wellspring, the source, the hub of my existence. It gives me tranquility, a closeness of nature and wildlife, good health and fitness, a sense of security, the opportunity for resourcefulness, reflection and creative thinking.\u201d LaBastille felt that a person\u2019s true nature emerged deep in the woods, away from social posturing and distraction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re looking for a real declaration of independence, and a deeper social experiment, try a woman living alone in the Adirondacks for decades</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her work remains relatively unknown in the male-dominated nature writing landscape, but I believe a copy of Woodswoman belongs next to Henry David Thoreau\u2019s Walden in a library. If you\u2019re looking for a real declaration of independence, and a deeper social experiment, try a woman living alone in the Adirondacks for decades.</p> <p>Thoreau lived at Walden for two years on borrowed land, financially supported by friends, with his mother cooking and doing laundry for him. In a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum\">scorching profile</a> of the canonized author, the New Yorker\u2019s Kathryn Schulz wrote: \u201cWalden Pond in 1845 was scarcely more off the grid, relative to contemporaneous society, than Prospect Park is today. The commuter train to Boston ran along its south-west side; in summer the place swarmed with picnickers and swimmers, while in winter it was frequented by ice cutters and skaters.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, Anne owned the land she called home and lived in a much deeper wilderness, without family support. Not only was she a certified Adirondack guide, she was also the first female professor of natural resources at Cornell, and conducted research on the endangered, and eventually extinct, giant pied-bill grebe bird. LaBastille\u2019s prose could be uneven, and her socio-political angles dated, but her experiences were revolutionary for the 1970s and 1980s.</p> <p>Despite her many contributions to the conservation, environmental and feminist movements, she remains a quiet cult figure in environmental literature. Her 1980 book Women and Wilderness examines this very phenomenon \u2013 the way female naturalists disappear from the record, particularly nonwhite women.</p> <p>Women and Wilderness, like Anne herself, was ahead of its time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">.</a> </figure>  <p><strong>I did not grow up camping</strong>, or knowing women who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/apr/10/how-to-escape-why-a-cabin-break-can-refresh-the-soul\">camped at all</a>, especially alone. But my partner and I have camped on an island in nearby Lake George every July for 16 years, and I realized that if I put those trips end-to-end, I\u2019ve already spent several months of my life camping in the Adirondacks. What\u2019s one night alone?</p> <p>For me, it simply affirms that I can manage alone. I can control my experience, select my own campsite, hear my unadulterated self loud and clear.

There is, I believe, likewise a new preoccupation lurking in the biggest brains of our time, and that theme is summed up in one word \u2013 identity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/britain-cant-be-reborn-while-while-were-still-lost-fantasies-about-past\">Britain can\u2019t be reborn while we\u2019re still lost in fantasies about the past | David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What possible basis could I have for making what may, I realise, sound like a wild claim? Well, in a know-nothing political age Prospect, the magazine I edit, felt it would be timely to salute intellectual effort by this week <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/the-worlds-top-50-thinkers-2019\" title=\"\">publishing a list of 50 top thinkers</a>. They have been picked on the basis of fruitfully engaging with the problems of our times, giving weight to originality, impact and communication. We have consulted closely with global authorities on economics, history and science about their peers, and considered the books and ideas we can see making waves. The biggest of these waves \u2013 by far \u2013 are those concerning identity.</p> <p>That\u2019s not the only change since the magazine produced its <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/theworldstopintellectuals\" title=\"\">first global hit parade</a> in 2005. Some differences are stark. For example, whereas in 2005 there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/sep/30/highereducation.uk2\" title=\"\">90 men and just 10 women</a>, today the gender mix is essentially 50-50. And certain subjects have gained prominence exactly as you\u2019d expect: climate science and especially tech.</p> <p>There are other changes, too, that you\u2019d expect. In economics, the brightest minds are asking newly disruptive questions. <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-great-globalisation-lie-economics-finance-trump-brexit\" title=\"\">Dani Rodrik</a> is included for his erudite exploration of why the promise of globalisation has disappointed so many, as well as Anne Case and Angus Deaton for elucidating the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/16/deaths-of-despair-once-an-american-phenomenon-now-haunt-britain\" title=\"\">human toll of American capitalism</a>.

      "bodyText": "What is preoccupying the world\u2019s leading minds? It is an audacious question for sure. Some might say leading physicists will be concentrating on physics, leading philosophers on philosophy, historians on history and so on. And yet when we look back on different eras, we can sometimes spot a thread \u2013 the preoccupation with truth in ancient Athens, with beauty in Renaissance Europe, with political \u201creason\u201d during the Enlightenment, with scientific progress during the industrial age. There is, I believe, likewise a new preoccupation lurking in the biggest brains of our time, and that theme is summed up in one word \u2013 identity. What possible basis could I have for making what may, I realise, sound like a wild claim? Well, in a know-nothing political age Prospect, the magazine I edit, felt it would be timely to salute intellectual effort by this week publishing a list of 50 top thinkers. They have been picked on the basis of fruitfully engaging with the problems of our times, giving weight to originality, impact and communication. We have consulted closely with global authorities on economics, history and science about their peers, and considered the books and ideas we can see making waves. The biggest of these waves \u2013 by far \u2013 are those concerning identity. That\u2019s not the only change since the magazine produced its first global hit parade in 2005. Some differences are stark. For example, whereas in 2005 there were 90 men and just 10 women, today the gender mix is essentially 50-50. And certain subjects have gained prominence exactly as you\u2019d expect: climate science and especially tech. There are other changes, too, that you\u2019d expect. In economics, the brightest minds are asking newly disruptive questions. Dani Rodrik is included for his erudite exploration of why the promise of globalisation has disappointed so many, as well as Anne Case and Angus Deaton for elucidating the human toll of American capitalism. Economic historian Adam Tooze features for exposing the limitations of nation-based macroeconomics, as does Hyun-Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements for starting to sketch the alternative of a border-straddling macro-financial perspective. All interesting stuff, but a natural response to the crash. The bit I didn\u2019t see coming is how many big minds would be consumed by variants of a single question: who are we? By my reckoning it is around half. What exactly, disparate thinkers are asking, does it mean to be American, Muslim, Indian, female, black or simply human? Starting with that last and most general question of identity, primatologist Frans de Waal has lit up the human condition by living with apes, and the fast-rising philosophical star Amia Srinivasan has written brilliantly on octupuses and termites, noting how often people have looked at insects and \u201cseen themselves\u201d. There\u2019s room, too, for geneticist Robert Plomin, who believes modern science has done for the idea of the blank slate, but refuses to lapse into genetic determinism, and instead focuses on how society can even out the odds for people with different DNA. As it happens, the first three names on the list \u2013 and they are just alphabetical for now, with a public vote to pick the top 10 open \u2013 are all wrestling with identity. Naomi Alderman\u2019s novel Disobedience, about a London rabbi\u2019s bisexual daughter, explores how faith communities can find space for difference; Syrian architect Marwa al-Sabouni explains how deadly walls of misunderstanding in Syria grew up due to a dearth of public spaces; philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah reconciles the importance of grounded identities with the need to protect vulnerable groups. That last need is made all the more pressing by the cheerleader for racism in the White House. A rare journalist on the list is Ta-Nehisi Coates, in the summer the argument of his influential Atlantic essay The Case for Reparations finally reached Congress. Ghanaian-born, US-based novelist Yaa Gyasi is here for Homecoming, which makes sense of modern America by tracing its story forward from the nation\u2019s original sin of slavery. Back in Europe, Cas Mudde makes the grade as the pre-eminent scholar of the identity-based populist backlash. Closer to home, David Olusoga features because of writing and broadcasting that forces Britain to rethink a troubling imperial past. Coming from a very different perspective is JD Vance, a conservative venture capitalist from the wrong side of the tracks. His memoir Hillbilly Elegy sympathetically locates the roots of the rage of the US\u2019s white working class to grim conditions like those he grew up in. Then there is social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who riles leftwing campus activists by pointing to evidence about how feelings can lead you astray, and urges them to clamber out of deep culture-war trenches. The work of many of our other top thinkers \u2013 critic Sarah Churchwell, psychoanalytic scholar Jacqueline Rose, novelist Arundhati Roy and philosopher Kate Manne \u2013 all engage with gender or national identities. The precedents are not happy: religious, racial and national identities have come to the forefront of thinking during war, strife or dictatorships. Until recently, they wouldn\u2019t have loomed so large on any plausible list of top thinkers drawn up in the west. It may be tempting to imagine their prominence is due to multiculturalism.

Who wrote in 2014 of Britain as \u201ca nation of broken families clamouring about their entitlements siring ill-educated and undisciplined kids unfamiliar with the concept of right and wrong\u201d? Who described with relish \u201cthe hulking fat tattooed chavmonkey standing in the queue at Burger King\u201d? Who characterised the British masses as inhabiting \u201ca dumbed-down culture\u201d, being in thrall to \u201cthe background fugue of idiocy, the moronic inferno, of celebrity fuckstories\u201d, and spending their time \u201cwatching TV, masturbating to pornography on the internet, getting drunk\u201d? That would be Liddle in his last book, whose title, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/22/selfish-whining-monkeys-rod-liddle-review\" title=\"\"><em>Selfish Whining Monkeys</em></a>, may just possibly have had a slight whiff of contempt and vilification.</p> <p>But that was then, this is now. Liddle\u2019s \u201cchavmonkeys\u201d have been redeemed by the Brexit referendum. Their \u201cfugue of idiocy\u201d is now a swelling symphony of reasserted sovereignty, their \u201cdumbed-down culture\u201d a fount of wisdom. The man who saw a \u201cthe moronic inferno\u201d now champions the people against the \u201cstereotype of the decrepit moron Leave voter\u201d. For now, apparently, it is liberal remainers who commit the unforgivable sin of calling those voters stupid, \u201cuneducated thickos\u201d \u2013 and racists to boot. The evidence for this contention, as for everything else in Liddle\u2019s polemic, is vanishingly thin. Yet the claim is central to his diagnosis of \u201ca grotesque and unprecedented betrayal of the country\u201d by the BBC, parliament, the judiciary, the civil service, Theresa May\u2019s government and of course the \u201cIrish spite\u201d embodied in that \u201coily little shit\u201d, the taoiseach Leo Varadkar.</p> <p>Liddle recalls that on the morning of the referendum result in 2016, he posted a one-line message on his Facebook page: \u201cBetcha we don\u2019t leave.\u201d He now adds that he and his wife agreed that \u201cthey won\u2019t let it happen\u201d. Thus his narrative of Brexit betrayed is not a response to events since that (for him) glorious morning. It is the chronicle of a death foretold. And in a sense, this intuition of inevitable failure was quite right. Failure was baked in. The promise of a Brexit that delivered all the benefits of EU membership with none of the costs could not survive contact with reality. Brexit was not \u201cbetrayed\u201d. It was dead on arrival.</p> <p>What makes Liddle\u2019s book so dishonest is that he seems well aware of this, but persists with his pre\u2011prepared tale of treachery nonetheless. He accepts that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-in-hell-for-those-who-backed-brexit-without-plan\" title=\"\">Donald Tusk \u201chad a point\u201d when he spoke of a special place in hell</a> for those who urged people to vote leave without having a plan for Brexit. He concedes that the leave campaign was \u201cutterly lost\u201d in the aftermath of its victory: \u201cThere was no sense of direction, no notion of a strategy, no notion as to how to proceed from here.\u201d How can a non-existent project, one that is already \u201cutterly lost\u201d, be betrayed? Can a strategy that has never been created be thwarted by traitors?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32b2b79fb34776a54f47c713b587fe6ea55c37d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32b2b79fb34776a54f47c713b587fe6ea55c37d4/749_1202_3114_3893/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rod Liddle now champions \u2018the people\u2019 against the \u2018stereotype of the decrepit moron Leave voter\u2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Liddle now champions \u2018the people\u2019 against the \u2018stereotype of the decrepit moron Leave voter\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tellingly, Liddle specifies the moment of perfidy. The conspiracy, as he sees it, began as soon as \u201cthe establishment\u201d started talking about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/24/soft-hard-brexit-eu-britain-uk\" title=\"\">\u201chard Brexit\u201d and a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d</a>, \u201cwhereas hitherto we had simply been talking about Brexit\u201d. In other words, the betrayal started as soon as \u201cBrexit\u201d acquired any actual content. Once \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d became \u201cBrexit means this or that\u201d, it was being sold out. There is here a kind of truth \u2013 the pure, unbetrayed Brexit could exist only in the abstract. To give it concrete meaning was to sully it. Nowhere does Liddle ever tell us what he himself actually thinks Brexit means in the real world. How could he, since by his own definition that would be an act of betrayal?</p> <p>Of a piece is Liddle\u2019s suggestion that Brexit was betrayed because its implementation was allowed to pass into the \u201chands of politicians \u2026 and away from the people who had voted\u201d. How exactly does he think \u201cthe people who had voted\u201d were supposed to negotiate the mutual rights of citizens, the divorce bill, the UK-Ireland border and a vastly complex trade deal? Even conceding that the people who were, in Liddle\u2019s pre-Brexit rantings, so sunk in idiocy five years ago, are now intellectual giants, how might this process be managed? Might the people, perhaps, elect delegates to some kind of representative assembly which in turn would choose an executive?</p> <p>Liddle is as untroubled by facts as by logic. He repeatedly cites the figure of \u00a39bn as the UK\u2019s annual net contribution to the EU \u2013 it is \u00a37.9bn. The House of Commons library report of 24 June on the net contribution says the \u00a39bn does not take account of EU funds given to non governmental agencies in the UK (universities and so on). He thinks Ireland was \u201cforced\u201d by the EU to hold another referendum on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/18/eu.politics1\" title=\"\">Nice treaty</a> in 2001 \u2013 it wasn\u2019t. He thinks the DUP speaks for \u201cthe Northern Irish\u201d, even though it gets a third of the vote and does not represent the strongly anti-Brexit majority. He claims Britain could have negotiated a trade deal with the EU before it discussed a withdrawal agreement, even though the EU can\u2019t do a trade deal with Britain until it has actually left. His understanding of the border question \u2013 blockchain can solve \u201calmost all\u201d the problems \u2013 is childish. He even seems oblivious to the basic history of the UK: \u201cOur boundaries have not shifted much over the years.\u201d (So Ireland neither joined the UK in 1801 nor left it in 1922?)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27067cb92870e08faf73943075210c8ce713c14d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27067cb92870e08faf73943075210c8ce713c14d/0_316_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A shop in Dudley in the West Midlands, where the majority of the 2016 referendum voters opted to leave the EU.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shop in Dudley in the West Midlands, where the majority of the 2016 referendum voters opted to leave the EU.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the heart of Liddle\u2019s new pose as defender of the people is his righteous rage against \u201cthe allegations that Leave voters were all racists\u201d. His only actual source for this \u201callegation\u201d is Diane Abbott, who Liddle quotes as saying that \u201cpeople who intended voting Leave \u2018want to see less foreign-looking people on their streets\u2019\u201d. Abbott did not say this about people who intended to vote leave.

      "bodyText": "\u201cNever,\u201d Rod Liddle writes in his jeremiad on the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Brexit, \u201chave so many blameless people in this country been held in such contempt, or been subject to such vilification by an elite.\u201d Really? Who wrote in 2014 of Britain as \u201ca nation of broken families clamouring about their entitlements siring ill-educated and undisciplined kids unfamiliar with the concept of right and wrong\u201d? Who described with relish \u201cthe hulking fat tattooed chavmonkey standing in the queue at Burger King\u201d? Who characterised the British masses as inhabiting \u201ca dumbed-down culture\u201d, being in thrall to \u201cthe background fugue of idiocy, the moronic inferno, of celebrity fuckstories\u201d, and spending their time \u201cwatching TV, masturbating to pornography on the internet, getting drunk\u201d? That would be Liddle in his last book, whose title, Selfish Whining Monkeys, may just possibly have had a slight whiff of contempt and vilification. But that was then, this is now. Liddle\u2019s \u201cchavmonkeys\u201d have been redeemed by the Brexit referendum. Their \u201cfugue of idiocy\u201d is now a swelling symphony of reasserted sovereignty, their \u201cdumbed-down culture\u201d a fount of wisdom. The man who saw a \u201cthe moronic inferno\u201d now champions the people against the \u201cstereotype of the decrepit moron Leave voter\u201d. For now, apparently, it is liberal remainers who commit the unforgivable sin of calling those voters stupid, \u201cuneducated thickos\u201d \u2013 and racists to boot. The evidence for this contention, as for everything else in Liddle\u2019s polemic, is vanishingly thin. Yet the claim is central to his diagnosis of \u201ca grotesque and unprecedented betrayal of the country\u201d by the BBC, parliament, the judiciary, the civil service, Theresa May\u2019s government and of course the \u201cIrish spite\u201d embodied in that \u201coily little shit\u201d, the taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Liddle recalls that on the morning of the referendum result in 2016, he posted a one-line message on his Facebook page: \u201cBetcha we don\u2019t leave.\u201d He now adds that he and his wife agreed that \u201cthey won\u2019t let it happen\u201d. Thus his narrative of Brexit betrayed is not a response to events since that (for him) glorious morning. It is the chronicle of a death foretold. And in a sense, this intuition of inevitable failure was quite right. Failure was baked in. The promise of a Brexit that delivered all the benefits of EU membership with none of the costs could not survive contact with reality. Brexit was not \u201cbetrayed\u201d. It was dead on arrival. What makes Liddle\u2019s book so dishonest is that he seems well aware of this, but persists with his pre\u2011prepared tale of treachery nonetheless. He accepts that Donald Tusk \u201chad a point\u201d when he spoke of a special place in hell for those who urged people to vote leave without having a plan for Brexit. He concedes that the leave campaign was \u201cutterly lost\u201d in the aftermath of its victory: \u201cThere was no sense of direction, no notion of a strategy, no notion as to how to proceed from here.\u201d How can a non-existent project, one that is already \u201cutterly lost\u201d, be betrayed? Can a strategy that has never been created be thwarted by traitors? Tellingly, Liddle specifies the moment of perfidy. The conspiracy, as he sees it, began as soon as \u201cthe establishment\u201d started talking about a \u201chard Brexit\u201d and a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d, \u201cwhereas hitherto we had simply been talking about Brexit\u201d. In other words, the betrayal started as soon as \u201cBrexit\u201d acquired any actual content. Once \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d became \u201cBrexit means this or that\u201d, it was being sold out. There is here a kind of truth \u2013 the pure, unbetrayed Brexit could exist only in the abstract. To give it concrete meaning was to sully it. Nowhere does Liddle ever tell us what he himself actually thinks Brexit means in the real world. How could he, since by his own definition that would be an act of betrayal? Of a piece is Liddle\u2019s suggestion that Brexit was betrayed because its implementation was allowed to pass into the \u201chands of politicians \u2026 and away from the people who had voted\u201d. How exactly does he think \u201cthe people who had voted\u201d were supposed to negotiate the mutual rights of citizens, the divorce bill, the UK-Ireland border and a vastly complex trade deal? Even conceding that the people who were, in Liddle\u2019s pre-Brexit rantings, so sunk in idiocy five years ago, are now intellectual giants, how might this process be managed? Might the people, perhaps, elect delegates to some kind of representative assembly which in turn would choose an executive? Liddle is as untroubled by facts as by logic. He repeatedly cites the figure of \u00a39bn as the UK\u2019s annual net contribution to the EU \u2013 it is \u00a37.9bn. The House of Commons library report of 24 June on the net contribution says the \u00a39bn does not take account of EU funds given to non governmental agencies in the UK (universities and so on). He thinks Ireland was \u201cforced\u201d by the EU to hold another referendum on the Nice treaty in 2001 \u2013 it wasn\u2019t. He thinks the DUP speaks for \u201cthe Northern Irish\u201d, even though it gets a third of the vote and does not represent the strongly anti-Brexit majority. He claims Britain could have negotiated a trade deal with the EU before it discussed a withdrawal agreement, even though the EU can\u2019t do a trade deal with Britain until it has actually left. His understanding of the border question \u2013 blockchain can solve \u201calmost all\u201d the problems \u2013 is childish. He even seems oblivious to the basic history of the UK: \u201cOur boundaries have not shifted much over the years.\u201d (So Ireland neither joined the UK in 1801 nor left it in 1922?) At the heart of Liddle\u2019s new pose as defender of the people is his righteous rage against \u201cthe allegations that Leave voters were all racists\u201d. His only actual source for this \u201callegation\u201d is Diane Abbott, who Liddle quotes as saying that \u201cpeople who intended voting Leave \u2018want to see less foreign-looking people on their streets\u2019\u201d. Abbott did not say this about people who intended to vote leave. She said it on Question Time in April 2017, long after the vote. She did not say it about leave voters as a whole \u2013 she actually said: \u201cThe people that complain about the freedom of movement will not be satisfied because what they really want is to see less foreign-looking people on their streets.\u201d And she also added that she would \u201cnever say that people voted to come out because they were racist\u201d. This is the sole foundation for Liddle\u2019s core argument. Equally disingenuous, though, is his contention that racism and xenophobia played no role at all in the leave vote. The grossly misleading posters showing brown-skin hordes supposedly queueing to get into the EU were \u201ca matter of taste rather than accuracy\u201d. He acknowledges that the use by the official leave campaign of Turkey\u2019s allegedly imminent membership of the EU was \u201ca little bit speculative\u201d. But, he adds, it did not affect \u201ca single vote, apart maybe from some Kurds\u201d. He does not tell us how he knows this or whether he has explained to Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings how they wasted so much money and effort in appealing to a non-existent xenophobia. It is just as well that it does not exist. If it did, people might misunderstand the benign nature of Liddle\u2019s questions about whether immigrants can have proper feelings for \u201cthe nation\u201d: \u201cIf you are a fairly recent arrival in this country, does its long existence as a nation state matter very much to you? Do you have a stake in our history? Is the UK\u2019s history as an independent country as impinging as it might be on someone whose family has lived here for countless generations?\u201d He insists on giving one despised anti-Brexit campaigner her full name: \u201cGina Miller, n\u00e9e Singh\u201d though he never refers, for example, to \u201cTheresa May, n\u00e9e Brasier\u201d. Otherwise readers might not realise that beneath Miller\u2019s English-sounding name lurks a woman with no stake in \u201cour\u201d history. Here we face the underlying toxicity of the myth of betrayal. Without the treachery of those who do not belong to \u201cus\u201d, Brexit would always have been wonderful.

Though it has always been hard to ascertain what he knows and does not know, it appears he knows he is unpopular: he fired three of his five internal pollsters in June because of their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html\">dismal projections</a>. The Republicans know this, too. But they also have no substantive policy agenda to present to the American people, only white rage and resentment, racism and xenophobia, all of which have culminated in the Trump administration\u2019s spectacle of wanton cruelty along the southern border.</p> <p>As the 2020 election campaign begins, Trump and the Republicans have not been coy about their strategy. They intend to foment hatred of \u201cthe other\u201d among their predominantly white base, to weaponize false accusations of antisemitism against progressive politicians, to pour kerosene on the fires of the culture wars and fight \u2013 against women\u2019s rights, LGBT rights, reproductive rights \u2013 with renewed vigor.</p> <p>Hence President Trump\u2019s latest stream of racist invective on Twitter, this time directed at the group of four, first-year congresswomen \u2013 Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib \u2013 that some affectionately refer to as \u201cthe Squad\u201d.</p> <p>Trump tweeted that the four women of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to \u201cthe totally broken and crime infested\u201d countries they came from (all are American citizens and only Omar was born outside the United States). Trump then doubled down on his attacks against them Monday morning following Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s appearance on Fox &amp; Friends. \u201cWe all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of Communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own Country,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150766494697107456\">the president tweeted</a>, quoting Graham. \u201cThey are Anti-Semitic, they are Anti-America, we don\u2019t need to know anything about them personally, talk about their policies.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>After less than a year in office, the members of the Squad have greatly expanded the realm of political possibility in the United States</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet it is precisely their policies that have Trump and the Republicans worked up into a frothy lather. The members of the Squad, in stark contrast to not only the Republicans but the rest of the Democrats, have championed progressive policy proposals \u2013 from the Green New Deal to Medicare for All to student debt cancellation to abolishing Ice and the Department of Homeland Security to increasing the top marginal tax rate to 70%.</p> <p>These proposals are popular, and not only among liberal Democrats, but across a wide swath of the American public. <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/poll-finds-broad-support-for-ocasio-cortezs-70-top-tax-rate-proposal-2019-01-15\">A poll</a> conducted earlier this year found that 60% of independent voters supported Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 70% top tax-rate proposal, as did 45% of Republicans. Polls consistently show <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2019/07/02/majority-backs-medicare-for-all-replacing-private-plans-if-preferred-providers-stay/\">a clear majority</a> of Americans back Medicare for All. Even as sweeping a proposal as the Green New Deal enjoys <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/opinion/sunday/green-new-deal-mcconnell.html\">more support than opposition</a> among likely voters, Obama-to-Trump voters and moderates. There is an obvious desire for the kind of transformational politics that the members of the Squad have brought to Congress.</p> <p>Indeed, while much of the media coverage of the various Squad members have focused on their identities, their appeal goes far beyond matters of representation. Of course, representation is important, and the Squad, comprising women of color, represents important \u201cfirsts\u201d \u2013 the first Muslim-American congresswomen, the youngest ever member of Congress, the first black female representative from Massachusetts. They represent what America looks like today far better than the pale, greying gerontocracy that rules the country. At 45, Pressley is the oldest member of the Squad; Nancy Pelosi, for comparison, is 79 and Trump, 73.</p> <p>But what distinguishes them as much as who they are is what they have done. After less than a year in office, the members of the Squad have greatly expanded the realm of political possibility in the United States. They have energized the Democratic party base with a fighting progressivism, choosing open confrontation with the Republicans over the tepid triangulation that the Democrats have longed preferred \u2013 and which the party\u2019s leadership mistakenly still does. They speak not in focus-grouped platitudes but with real passion and empathy for ordinary people\u2019s pain. It is for this reason that they have succeeded in connecting with the wider public. It is why they dominate the news day after day. And it is why they drive Trump and the Republicans crazy. In the Squad \u2013 diverse, comparatively young, energetic and charismatic \u2013 Trump and the Republicans see their own impending political and literal obsolescence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What distinguishes them [the Squad] as much as who they are is what they have done</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Faced with the prospect of multiracial social democracy that the members of the Squad represent, Trump and the Republicans are employing the same tactics to thwart progressive political change and sabotage redistributivist policies that defenders of the existing order have used throughout American history.

John Lewis now insists the damage to the carcasses was caused by steam, although you say that since you and your husband are pilots and away from home for long periods, the kitchen is only lightly used. In any case, a kitchen should be designed to withstand damp. The store admits that the finish you required stopped being manufactured in early 2017, a year after the new carcasses had been ordered and 18 months before you were informed of the fact. During two weeks of negotiations with its press office, it first insisted you would have to accept carcasses in a different finish, as its terms and conditions state that an alternative will be offered if items cease to be produced. This ignores the fact that the correct finish was still in production during the first year of bungled deliveries. Eventually, it capitulated and agreed to replace all the units so that they match, as well as offer \u00a31,000 in recognition of the time it\u2019s taken. \u201cThe delays in ordering replacement carcasses were due to human error and we recognise this falls short of the high level of service our customers are right to expect of us. Since then we have made a number of improvements to ensure this does not happen to any other customers,\u201d says a spokesperson.

      "bodyText": "Retired Lt Gen Russel Honor\u00e9 knows a stupid plan when he sees one. It was the day after Hurricane Katrina had wrought catastrophic flooding in the city of New Orleans in August 2005, and Honor\u00e9 \u2013 a veteran of Desert Storm in the first Gulf war \u2013 had just been appointed the commander of a joint taskforce to lead the recovery. The heat was sweltering. There were some 16,000 residents stranded at the city\u2019s Superdome football stadium and Honor\u00e9\u2019s orders were to get them evacuated as soon as possible. The building had been compromised by the storm. It was overcrowded and supplies were spotty. As Honor\u00e9 tells it, the national guard wanted to use trucks to evacuate through the chest-high water that now surrounded most of the building, to a location where survivors could board buses. There was a problem though: they only had a handful of vehicles. Honor\u00e9 saw a simple solution: \u201cLet\u2019s walk the healthy adults out, and they can carry the children if they want. But all we got to do is walk a block.\u201d The police meanwhile, told Honor\u00e9 that they were unsure if they had the authority to evacuate people across the only relatively dry footpath, which crossed commercial property. They were worried about \u201csecurity\u201d. Honor\u00e9 exploded. \u201cWe have the goddamn authority! We\u2019re not walking in the water, and we\u2019re not using goddamn trucks. Shut the fuck up and let\u2019s get it done,\u201d he re-enacts in his famously salty Louisiana drawl.

But Honor\u00e9\u2019s gruff command style belied his primary motivation: saving lives. At a time when city police had allegedly been cleared to shoot looters on sight, Honor\u00e9 threw his considerable gravitas behind restraint. \u201cPut those damn weapons down. I\u2019m not going to tell you again, goddamn it,\u201d he barked at guardsmen in footage from Spike Lee\u2019s Katrina documentary When the Levees Broke.

The crown\u2019s full exploitation rights were granted by parliament in 2004.</p>\n    <p>Until the 1960s there was no formalised legislation declaring Crown ownership below the low-water mark. Until then, sovereignty was by convention and common law. In the eighteenth century, a three mile limit was adopted by most coastal states.</p>\n    <p>There were exceptions, like Soviet Russia, which claimed 12 nautical miles. In the twentieth century, this wider limit came into use across the world, including the UK, and it remains in place today.</p>\n    <p>The Queen\u2019s marine domain stretches much further. It extends to the continental shelf, a zone up to 200m deep around the British Isles. To the east, the UK limit reaches halfway to the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>\n    <p>This is a relatively recent development. Until the late 1950s, government lawyers were wary of extending sovereignty, for fear this might draw attention to the fact that there was actually no formal legislation enshrining crown ownership below the low water mark. A decade after her coronation, the issue was being raised by the monarch herself. Following <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-and-comparative-law-quarterly/article/the-incorporation-of-continental-shelf-rights-into-united-kingdom-law/31232FA740E0A166F7B0070EE8403DE9\">an audience with Queen Elizabeth in 1962</a>, the Earl of Perth, crown commissioner, reported that \u201cshe had seen something about the Crown Estate taking over rights on land under the sea\u201d.</p>\n    <p>The discovery of North Sea oil and gas was a catalyst, with drilling companies demanding clarity of ownership. In 1964, the Continental Shelf Act set the much wider boundary that remains in place today.</p>\n    <p>The ownership of oil and gas on land and at sea rests with the crown, but since 1934 the job of exploiting it, by setting royalties and assigning drilling rights, has belonged with government.</p>\n    <p>Wind power is different. From the first round in 2000, the leasing of wind farm plots was managed by the Crown Estate. Even then, demand was lively. The auction generated plans for 20 farms. All were confined to the 12 mile limit, because ministers felt that the UK could not use the 1964 act to permit big structures like turbines far out at sea without new legislation.</p>\n    <p>More space was needed if this green energy source was to grow. So in 2002, government lawyers suggested using a UN convention to create an \"exclusive economic zone\" for wind and wave power within the continental shelf boundary. A green paper asked for views on \u201cthe most appropriate body\u201d in which to vest management of this new zone. The question was settled by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/20/notes\">2004 Energy Act</a>; exploitation rights would remain with the crown.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Criticised as a cash grab by some energy companies, the auction has already prompted calls for a review of whether the Queen should have the right to claim any revenues from offshore wind.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf this source of value is going to increase fourfold, let\u2019s make sure that value stays with the public rather than being spent on redoing the royal palace,\u201d said Molly Scott Cato, the finance spokesperson for the Green party.</p> \n<p>The sovereign grant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/18/buckingham-palace-to-undergo-370m-refurbishment\">was increased two years ago</a>, from its previous level of 15%, in order to pay for extensive renovations at Buckingham Palace.

Industry experts expect the complex bidding process to raise record sums, which could increase energy bills and hand a windfall to the crown \u2013 potentially generating hundreds of millions for the Queen.

Its profits go to the Treasury, which then sends 25% back to the royal household in the form of the sovereign grant. Criticised as a cash grab by some energy companies, the auction has already prompted calls for a review of whether the Queen should have the right to claim any revenues from offshore wind. \u201cIf this source of value is going to increase fourfold, let\u2019s make sure that value stays with the public rather than being spent on redoing the royal palace,\u201d said Molly Scott Cato, the finance spokesperson for the Green party.

The Nazi occupation saw 160,000 Jews forced into a small area of the city that became known as the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto.

      "bodyText": "\u2018If it doesn\u2019t fit, it fits perfectly,\u201d is something of a buzz-phrase in Poland\u2019s third-largest city, and it doesn\u2019t take long to see why. It is a place where the next surprise \u2013 a fantastical, seemingly incongruous unicorn sculpture, a courtyard in which the buildings are clad with irregular shards of broken mirrors, a two-storey piece of gable-end street art intended to be viewed through 3D glasses \u2013 is never far away. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (pronounced woodge and meaning boat, despite being landlocked and without a major river) is an urban sprawl slap-bang in the middle of Poland, around a two-hour drive west of Warsaw. In the 19th century it was one of the centres of Europe\u2019s textile industry but fell into decline after the second world war. It\u2019s now on the rise once more. The flat, green \u201cManchester of Poland\u201d (so called for its manufacturing heritage) is doing a fine job of reinventing itself, and its regeneration from crumbling post-Soviet backwater to modern European city is celebrated whenever possible. Those surprises start on arrival at the enormous, eerily quiet \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna railway station, a huge subterranean Death Star-esque building that is the third-largest station in Europe \u2013 despite the city\u2019s population being less than 700,000. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna is testament to the city\u2019s aspiration to supplant Warsaw as Poland\u2019s central travel hub. A lot of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is based around one street \u2013 Piotrkowska \u2013 which might make the place sound like a one-horse town until you consider that it is more than 4km long. The northern half of the street, between Liberty Square and the Piotrkowska Centrum tram station (dubbed the \u201cunicorn\u2019s stable\u201d for its colourful, wave-like roof, which eventually led to the addition of the aforementioned sculpture) is the most interesting for visitors, with its shops, bars, cafes and restaurants. The other half is worth investigating too, and I found the seemingly endless, straight cycle along the street\u2019s full length a meditative activity in itself, while a ride around the idyllic Reymonta Park near the street\u2019s south end was a bonus. There is a comprehensive network of buses and trams (single-journey ticket 60p) and the \u0141\u00f3d\u017aki Rower Publiczny public bike system can be used by non-residents after a registration process. My hotel, the newly opened Puro, also included free use of bikes as part of its room rate. Food and drink The city\u2019s modernisation has led to an increase in the quality and range of cuisine on offer alongside Polish staples such as pierogi (filled dumplings) and flaki (tripe soup). I had thick, tender sirloin steak (\u00a313) and homemade lemonade (\u00a32.50) at Bawe\u0142na; it is one of dozens of smart-but-informal restaurants in the old industrial buildings of Manufaktura, a retail and leisure area redeveloped in the mid-2000s. Manufaktura\u2019s museums, stores and play areas (in summer its central area is an artificial beach, in winter an ice rink) are geared towards families. Whereas, at OFF Piotrkowska (as the name suggests, just off Piotrkowska), there are boutique stores, food trucks, cool restaurants and bars clustered around a courtyard that hosts live music and other events. Ato Sushi is considered one of the best sushi places in Poland. I\u2019d no reason to doubt this as I tucked into delicious chunks of grilled octopus with a soy glaze (\u00a310) and a fresh maki set (\u00a310) \u2013 all of it prepared in front of me. The same people also run Ato Ramen at OFF Piotrkowska. Neapolitan-style pizza is common in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, and at Forno Nero \u2013 an unshowy spot in a side-street off Piotrkowska \u2013 I had a wonderful crispy diavola (\u00a36.30) \u2013 and generously sized Aperol spritzes (\u00a34). For a fix of traditional Polish food head to Piwnica \u0141\u00f3d\u017aka. Starters of a succulent beef tartare (\u00a33.70) and zalewajka (potato soup with bacon and marjoram, \u00a32.30) did for my appetite, and I barely made a dent in a main course of a crispy, well-seasoned pork cutlet with knedle (dumplings filled, unexpectedly but not unpleasantly, with strawberries, \u00a38). Art and culture My visit coincided with the 18th annual Fotofestiwal, during which exhibitions, film screenings, talks, children\u2019s events and parties are held across the city each June. Anna W\u0142odarska\u2019s photography exhibition, (Un)forgettable, which captured \u0141\u00f3d\u017a\u2019s crumbling buildings and backstreets just prior to regeneration, gave me a taste of the city\u2019s history \u2013 and was also a primer for its current metamorphosis. Right outside the exhibition venue (the Academic Centre of Artistic Initiatives) is Rosa\u2019s Passage, the buildings that the artist Joanna Rajkowska spent more than two years covering in mirror shards, creating one of the city\u2019s most beautiful and unexpected sights. Several of the many huge, striking street-art murals in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a are preserved Communist-era advertisements. A notable one is the painting of a butterfly promoting the state-run Pewex shops (where jeans, Coca-Cola and other imported goods could be bought with US dollars) at 21 Henryka Sienkiewicza. Many more pieces by Polish and international artists have been added in the last decade: this map shows where to find them. The Manufaktura complex has several major museums and galleries celebrating different aspects of the city. I visited the Museum of Art ms2 (admission \u00a33.20, closed Mondays) and toured its three-floor collection of modern art by international and Polish artists. The Museum of the Factory (admission \u00a32, closed Mondays) is a great way to understand the city\u2019s history and has a viewing tower (extra 60p), with an aerial view of the Manufaktura site. The Museum of the City of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (admission \u00a32, closed Mondays) is inside Izrael Pozna\u0144ski\u2019s Palace, an extraordinary neo-baroque building that was the textile magnate\u2019s (1833-1900) residence. It is crammed with artefacts and has rooms that celebrate the life of the legendary pianist Arthur Rubenstein. He was a native of the city who can also be found playing the piano (in statue form) on Piotrkowska and pulling his ears out in apparent mockery in one of the city\u2019s most notable and colourful gable-end murals. As the home of the National Film School (graduates include Roman Pola\u0144ski, Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski) \u2013 one of the most prestigious in the world\u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is the Poland\u2019s movie capital. The Museum of Cinematography has an extensive collection of film posters, artefacts, equipment and memorabilia. Though it has closed for refurbishment until 2020, it will continue to host some events and workshops \u2013 and its cinema remains open. Holocaust memorials At the outbreak of the second world war, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had the second-largest Jewish community in Poland (more than 230,000 people, almost a third of the city\u2019s population). The Nazi occupation saw 160,000 Jews forced into a small area of the city that became known as the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto. From here, thousands were deported to Nazi death camps, while those who remained suffered famine and disease. There is a huge Jewish cemetery on Bracka Street, where people from around the world still search for the graves of relatives killed during the occupation. The Radegast railway station, from where Jews were sent to the death camps in cattle trucks, is a particularly haunting memorial. A locomotive and four carriages are permanently at the platform, and official messages of apology and regret from European cities are displayed on the wall behind the station building. There is also the Survivors\u2019 Park, where around 600 trees each honour a particular Holocaust survivor, plaques for each also line a walkway, and the Monument of Poles Saving Jews and The Marek Edelman Dialogue Centre sit amid lawns, wooded areas and a pond. Music and nightlife Live music and clubbing isn\u2019t \u0141\u00f3d\u017a\u2019s strong suit but there are a handful of places worth checking out, including the city\u2019s one true underground club, DOM. There are also the ambient and experimental shows hosted by the small gallery and events space W Y and regular gigs and club nights put on by student radio station Studenckie Radio \u017bak Politechniki \u0141\u00f3d\u017akiej. The multidisciplinary arts venue Fabryka Sztuki\u2019s LDZ Alternatywa season comprises eight free shows during July and August, and covers Polish pop, psychedelic rock and jazz. The bar scene is much livelier. Piwoteka Narodowa is an excellent craft-beer destination \u2013 try a taster tray of seven of the brewery\u2019s own beers (\u00a34.50): mine included two rich stouts, a fruity wheat beer and what I\u2019ve decided was an \u201cintriguing\u201d horseradish ale. 6. Dzielnica is behind an unmarked door (at Piotrkowska 102) and up three flights of stairs; it has an extensive cocktail menu, plus a terrace and regular jazz shows. The bohemian-feeling Owoce i Warzywa has a similarly strong cocktail game (whisky sour \u00a33.40). Brush Barber Shop at OFF Piotrkowska is a barbershop by day and a cocktail bar by night. Don\u2019t be put off by how hipster that might sound, as the superb cocktails (I had a deliciously tart Octello, \u00a34) make it one of the best bars in town. \u2022 The trip was provided by \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Travel. Ryanair flies from East Midlands and Stansted to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a from around \u00a340 return. Puro Hotel has doubles from around \u00a375 B&amp;B. Non-fly options include Eurostar and ICE train to Berlin, overnight stay in Berlin, then train or bus to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.

The cars were allegedly being offered on social media for $45,000 to $60,000 \u2013 a fraction of the price of the real thing. * * * \u2018I just hate it\u2019 \u2013 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Tehran for more than three years, has been transferred to a mental health ward and is being kept out of contact with her relatives by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, her husband has said. According to those campaigning for her to be freed, she said before being transferred that she had arrived \u201chealthy and happy\u201d in Iran just over three years ago. \u201cLook at me now, I ended up in an asylum. It should be an embarrassment. Prison is getting harder and harder for me. I hate being played in the middle of a political game. I just hate it.\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 on charges of spying that are vehemently denied. * * * \u2018You pay for it, chum\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson has been accused of repeatedly ignoring expert advice on his so-called vanity projects as London mayor, leaving taxpayers with a bill of nearly \u00a31bn and rising. He championed eight high-profile projects that either ended in failure or turned out to have questionable value. In numerous cases he was told from the start they wouldn\u2019t work. Among them: a fleet of new Routemaster buses with the wrong kind of windows, and whose separate conductors were too costly to keep on; three unusable secondhand water cannon that had to be sold at a \u00a3300,000 loss; a \u00a35.2m study of putting an airport in the Thames Estuary, which came crashing down with an unfavourable report that Johnson refused to make public; and of course the Garden Bridge proposal, a \u00a353.5m failure. Johnson is the frontrunner to be the next prime minister, in case you needed reminding. * * * Cheque stub \u2013 The NHS could save \u00a33bn a year by giving people a bit of money when they quit smoking, according to a review, which found it makes people 50% more likely to snuff their habit. In trials, people were given monetary and other rewards ranging in value from \u00a335 to \u00a3912 \u2013 but the amount actually made little difference. Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said the idea had been discredited in the past. \u201cSo it\u2019s fantastic to see strong evidence that these innovative schemes work. Local authorities should consider this new research when designing comprehensive stop smoking services, as it could help target those in our communities who struggle the most to give up cigarettes.\u201d Smoking costs the economy about \u00a313bn a year. Today in Focus podcast: Lunar landing hoax theories On the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, a significant number of people across the world still believe it was all a hoax. Richard Godwin explores why the conspiracy theories endure. Plus Geoff Andrews on his part in the Guardian\u2019s front page on that historic day back in 1969. Lunchtime read: Memorable moon shots They\u2019re on their way \u2013 or at least they were, 50 years ago, when Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins began the trans-lunar journey that would climax with the historic touchdown of Apollo 11. Art critic Jonathan Jones considers whether the images returned from their specially crafted Hasselblad cameras are the greatest photos ever. Sport Andrew Strauss, England\u2019s former director of cricket, has urged the game\u2019s powerbrokers to learn from the mistakes of the past and capitalise on England\u2019s World Cup success. Meanwhile, Chris Woakes says England\u2019s players will back whatever decision Eoin Morgan makes over his future as the one-day captain. Dave Brailsford\u2019s rest-day habit of provoking the French resurfaced again as the Tour de France took a 24-hour pause in Albi, a day after the home hero Thibaut Pinot had been unceremoniously worked over by Geraint Thomas. Billy Vunipola has no plans to stay off social media during the forthcoming World Cup in Japan despite the controversy sparked by his support for Israel Folau \u2013 who has since been sacked for his homophobic outburst. Amir Khan has claimed that he and Manny Pacquiao have signed up for a fight and are targeting a meeting in Saudi Arabia later this year. Kieran Trippier is on the verge of sealing a move to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a deal worth \u00a320m plus add-ons and he has been given permission by Tottenham to travel to the Spanish capital for a medical. Ahead of this week\u2019s Open at Royal Portrush, Justin Rose has broken ranks from golf\u2019s leading players by criticising the new schedule for 2019, which features four majors in as many months. And the coach of the Santos women\u2019s team has criticised the Brazilian Football Confederation after players had to doss in a hotel lobby before a crucial first division game: \u201cThis is the respect that people have for women\u2019s football in Brazil.\u201d Business Asian stocks have been subdued as Wall Street ended a five-day winning streak after the first big round of corporate earnings reports.

The papers The front pages range across a variety of topics today. The Times and Guardian focus on politics and the prospect of a Boris Johnson prime ministership. The former suggests Johnson plans early election to hit Corbyn, while the latter looks back over the former mayor of London\u2019s legacy: \u201cJohnson accused over \u00a31bn vanity projects\u201d. The Financial Times reports on the political impact on the economy: \u201cSterling plunges to 2 year low on mounting risk of no-deal Brexit\u201d, while the Telegraph is preoccupied with the new \u201crubbish tip \u2018tax\u2019\u201d and the Mail has launched a campaign against \u201cdementia care bills betrayal\u201d.

Attacking the Tories for promising to help \u201csocial mobility\u201d, he will say: \u201cBehind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind. \u201cI reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life\u2019s essentials.\u201d He will call for a \u201cstructurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision, and of course a financial safety net as well\u201d. \u201cWithout any one of these three elements, we will not be able to achieve the sustained eradication of poverty, the dramatic narrowing of inequality, and the transformation of people\u2019s lives that will be the central purpose of the next Labour government. \u201cThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation said last year that in-work poverty is the problem of our times. I am committing today to ending this modern-day scourge to eliminating in-work poverty by the end of Labour\u2019s first full parliamentary term. \u201cAs chancellor in the next Labour government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty and how much we create a more equal society. By how much people\u2019s lives change for the better. Because that is our number one goal.\u201d The Resolution Foundation report will reveal that UK households have experienced slower income growth over the last two years than in the aftermath of the early 1990s recession, and the weakest growth outside of recessions since records began in 1961. In response to McDonnell\u2019s pledge, Claire Ainsley, the director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), an organisation pushing for social change, said it was \u201cunacceptable that more working families are being swept into poverty, so this significant ambition to eliminate in-work poverty is the right thing to do\u201d. \u201cWith more working families unable to make ends meet, people are frustrated at the failure of politics to unlock the jobs, investment and opportunities needed so their families and local economies can thrive,\u201d she said.",

As such, it is one of the best versions of Android you can get, and you can look forward to three years of software updates from release, including bi-monthly security updates. OnePlus gives you the choice of choice standard three-button Android navigation keys, Google\u2019s \u201cpill\u201d navigation button or gestures, which are smooth \u2013 swipe up from the centre to go home, up and hold for recently-used apps, or up and over to the right for the previously-used app. The back gesture, up from the left or right bottom edge, isn\u2019t as easy to use as Huawei\u2019s swipe in from the left or right side of the screen, which is also being adopted by Google for Android Q. Oxygen OS also comes with Zen Mode (a time out for your phone), a gaming mode and RAM boost, which learns the apps you use frequently and pre-caches them into RAM. There\u2019s also no real one-handed mode, though, which others such as Huawei include, which would have been helpful. Fingerprint scanner The fingerprint scanner is in the same position \u2013 under the display in the lower fifth of the screen \u2013 as the OnePlus 6T but has been dramatically sped up for fast, accurate unlocks that rival traditional capacitive fingerprint scanners. It matches the one on the OnePlus 7 Pro as the best in the business at the moment \u2013 everything else feels slow. Camera The OnePlus 7 has the same main camera as the 7 Pro, but lacks the ultra-wide angle and telephoto cameras, instead having a 5MP depth assist camera for portrait mode shots. The main camera is just as good as the 7 Pro, capturing some really detailed and well-exposed shots. Both smartphones have seen a barrage of recent software updates that have improved the cameras \u2013 something that\u2019s very good to see. It won\u2019t match the Google Pixel 3 or 3A for image quality, but most will be very pleased. Low light performance and the dedicated Nightscape mode are good but not quite class-leading. Zoom is relegated to up to 10x digital, which can\u2019t hold a flame to optical zoom, but is fine in a pinch. Video capture is pretty good at up to 4K60Hz, as is the selfie camera, which captures more detail than most might want. Three levels of beauty mode are available for those that want a little smoothing out of lifelines. Observations The screen comes with a pre-installed screen protector, which creates a sharp edge at the bottom of the phone you can feel when using swiping gestures The stereo speakers are pretty good The OnePlus alert slider on the side of the phone continues to be wonderful The included TPU case is one of the best I\u2019ve seen bundled with a phone The camera lump on the back is large, and I felt it more often when holding the device than with previous OnePlus phones Price The OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499 for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or \u00a3549 for 8GB and 256GB. For comparison, the 128GB OnePlus 7 Pro costs \u00a3699, the 128GB Huawei P30 Pro costs \u00a3899, the 128GB Huawei Mate 20 Pro costs \u00a3599, the 128GB Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs \u00a3899, the 64GB Google Pixel 3 XL costs \u00a3869, and the 64GB iPhone XS Max costs \u00a31,099. Verdict From the highs of the OnePlus 7 Pro, the \u201cnon-Pro\u201d OnePlus 7 may look like a consolation prize, but in many ways the OnePlus 7 is better because it holds true to the winning OnePlus formula: exceptional bang for your buck. It\u2019s smaller and lighter, which makes it easier to use while still being a big-screen phone. It\u2019s just as powerful, has the same great software and same smooth performance, and has a longer battery life than its Pro sibling. It even has the same unrivalled in-screen fingerprint sensor and great main camera. But if you were looking for a multi-camera, zoom in and out affair, this isn\u2019t it. And while the screen looks great, it isn\u2019t the same game-changing, addictively silky smooth display on the OnePlus 7 Pro. What you get for your \u00a3500 with the OnePlus 7 is a brilliant phone with an experience unrivalled anywhere near this price. It\u2019s so good that there are only a few non-5G phones I would consider over this, and even then it\u2019s a close call. Pros: fast performance, good screen, dual-sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5, great software, tiny notch, fast in-screen fingerprint sensor, alert slider Cons: glass back but no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage, no headphone socket Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, Samsung, OnePlus and Huawei compared and ranked OnePlus 7 Pro review: an absolute beast in every way Huawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery life Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screen Honor 20 review: Huawei\u2019s first new phone during Trump dispute",

It was just always there, a background hum. \u201cAs far back as I can remember, I wanted a better-looking body,\u201d says the 35-year-old US soldier, now stationed in Mons, Belgium. When he was 13, Miles spent a summer cutting grass to save up for a secondhand Soloflex exercise machine.

If it beeped when he was driving, he would pull over. Slowly, he whittled his body into shape. His muscles became striated, every fibre visible. Not big enough. At 95kg (210lbs) and 1.8 metres (6ft 2in), Miles wanted to be more muscular; leaner. He lost 22kg and started competing in amateur bodybuilding competitions. There was virtually no fat on him. \u201cYou pinch your skin and it just stays pinched.\u201d His girlfriend left him. \u201cShe began to realise that my body dysmorphia was like dating another person.\u201d The pursuit of muscularity took over his life. \u201cI just thought, I am so lean, and shredded, and veiny, and masculine \u2013 I don\u2019t ever want to go back to how I was before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet by 33, single again \u2013 the dysmorphia had claimed yet another relationship \u2013 it had all become too much and he was in a dark place. \u201cI did not enjoy life in any way, shape or form.\u201d All day long, he would starve himself, struggle through punishing workouts, go home and binge-eat before throwing it all up.

WWE wrestling was founded in 1980, and the likes of Hulk Hogan became celebrities. In the late 90s, a leaner but still very muscular aesthetic \u2013 popularised by Brad Pitt in the movie Fight Club \u2013 became fashionable.</p> \n<p>Today\u2019s muscle men stare down at us from the billboards of superhero films featuring stars such as Chris Hemsworth or Jason Momoa, the latter only last week body-shamed online after photographs emerged of him enjoying himself on holiday in fractionally less-than-superhero condition. On the small screen, the current crop of Love Island contestants mug for the cameras in tiny swimming trunks, all the better to display their perfect six-packs.</p> \n<p>However, just as fashion magazines don\u2019t cause anorexia, but contribute to a toxic environment in which extreme thinness is celebrated, Hulk Hogan, Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson and Chris Hemsworth are not to be blamed for the disordered behaviours sweeping our gyms. According to the NHS, we do not yet know what causes body dysmorphia disorders but genetics, a chemical imbalance in the brain or a traumatic experience in your past may play a part. You are also more likely to develop it<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/body-dysmorphia/\" title=\"\"> if you were bullied or abused as a child,</a> something student Nathaniel Shaw knows well. The 28-year-old was bullied at secondary school \u2013 they called him a Borrower, on account of his slender frame.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5784332899aa80c6ad88b511e1536f257924fbc4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5784332899aa80c6ad88b511e1536f257924fbc4/447_0_3393_5345/635.jpg\" alt=\"Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson in Fast &amp; Furious 6.\" width=\"635\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson in Fast &amp; Furious 6.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI was always the small kid in the corner that no one wanted to speak to.\u201d Social acceptance came one squat press at a time. \u201cFrom where I\u2019m from in Nottingham, because it\u2019s a very rough place, you\u2019re training to protect yourself. The bigger guys are the serious people that no one wants to mess with. That was the main thing at the start \u2013 get big and be taken seriously.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Shaw went to college at age 17, he had a plan: work out all winter and reveal his buff body come summer. But when he took off his T-shirt playing football one afternoon, a girl said that Shaw \u201chad no chest\u201d. He instantly put his top back on. \u201cI still wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d The unkind comment laid waste to Shaw\u2019s fragile self-esteem; he walked away from the wreckage determined to become even more shredded.</p> \n<p>Shaw\u2019s life became: the gym, home to eat enormous portions of tuna, pasta and cheese, move as little as possible to conserve energy and repeat. Shaw detached from the contours of normal life. He stayed in bed longer, later and missed exams. He was depressed. \u201cThe pursuit of this muscular ideal takes over people\u2019s lives,\u201d explains Nagata. \u201cThey become obsessed with it. They can\u2019t function in their daily life outside of pursuing this ideal and it can lead to depression, missing school or work, and losing their ability to do basic living tasks.\u201d</p> \n<p>To an observer, Shaw \u2013 who weighed 80kg at 1.7 metres \u2013 was tank-like. But that wasn\u2019t how he saw himself. \u201cI would be in the gym and say: \u2018I look like shit.\u2019 Everyone would be like: \u2018No you don\u2019t, you\u2019re huge, I wish I could look like that.\u2019\u201d Muscle dysmorphia is a disease of perception. Although its sufferers live in the material world \u2013 a place of grunting exertion and weighted bags and scoopable protein powders \u2013 they spend most of their time in an imagined reality, where they are incalculably huge. Their biceps are swollen watermelons; each muscle as finely striated as the delicate contours of a seashell.</p> \n<p>But even if they eventually achieve that physique, it is not enough. As soon as one muscular ideal is achieved, a new goal appears. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying: \u2018Once you step into a gym, you\u2019re forever small,\u2019\u201d says 27-year-old Rich Selby, an amateur bodybuilder from Cardiff. Miles agrees. \u201cEvery muscle could be bigger. I could be leaner. You look at yourself and feel like everything is small and weak. I have no chest muscles; I have no arm muscles ... you\u2019re judging yourself against an impossible standard.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social media reflects this standard back at you. \u201cYou\u2019re being sold a false reality,\u201d says Miles. \u201cI can get into really good shape, right before I\u2019m doing a bodybuilding competition, and use lighting and angles and filters to make my physique look even crazier than it already is, and save a bunch of pictures and upload them to make it seem that I always look like that, all year round.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some turn to illegal substances to attain this ideal. Tony, 23, works for a pharmaceutical distributor in Dallas. He started taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs, including testosterone, equipoise and nandrolone, two years ago. The drugs created a dangerous feedback loop: the more he injected, the more his body changed and the more he took. \u201cPeople are like: \u2018Wow, that guy\u2019s a tank.\u2019 They have more respect for you ... I thought, heck yeah, I\u2019m going to take more so I can get even bigger.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a common experience: muscle dysmorphia can be fuelled by the positive reinforcement men receive from other men in the gym. \u201cWhen you\u2019re large, you get a lot of respect,\u201d Selby confirms. Men come up to him and ask how much he can bench. Sometimes they try to start fights. \u201cThat\u2019s why people become addicted. They\u2019re insecure, so they need confirmation from other people.\u201d Selby self-identifies as having muscle dysmorphia, but believes that he has it under control, because he has good self-esteem.</p> \n<p>Up close, you can see the havoc muscle dysmorphia wreaks. \u201cYour interpersonal relationships fall apart \u2013 but you are so caught up in the endorphin rush of affirmation from your gym buddies, you barely notice,\u201d says Miles. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of an asshole. You don\u2019t realise it ... you just become this all-around grouch. It consumes not only all of your time and focus, but also the human part of you.\u201d It\u2019s also a lonely existence. All your time is spent preparing protein-rich food, but because you are over-exercising, you are often \u201chungry, and cranky, and don\u2019t sleep well\u201d.</p> \n<p>Among the young men Nagata surveyed, 2.8% had used illegal steroids, and it is estimated that up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/21/up-to-a-million-britons-use-steroids-for-looks-not-sport\" title=\"\">1 million Brits take performance-enhancing drugs.</a> \u201cSteroids can lead to heart disease, kidney problems and liver damage,\u201d says Nagata. There are also mental health risks. \u201cPeople may have extreme irritability, aggression, paranoia and can be violent.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tony was one young man who used drugs to bulk up. He knew what he was doing was dangerous: he would even donate blood to get his blood pressure down. \u201cI just genuinely didn\u2019t care.\u201d As he cycled on and off drugs, he experienced dramatic mood swings. He got fired from his job at a hardware store for screaming at a coworker in the break room. Eventually, his mental health deteriorated so much that he came off all the drugs in May last year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf1863c562a082f491d117660c8394255f3d856f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1863c562a082f491d117660c8394255f3d856f/2896_286_3333_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Every muscle could be bigger.

Selby thinks people are driven to desperate measures because they cannot disassociate who they are from how they look.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s an obsession that can prove fatal. Freddie Dibben, 28, died in March 2017 after his heart became enlarged by the stimulant Clenbuterol. His father Clifford, 69, found him. \u201cThe hardest part was going back through to the kitchen and telling his mum what I found. It\u2019ll never go away.\u201d Like Tony, Freddie experienced mood swings. \u201cHe would snap at you,\u201d Clifford says, recalling an incident where Freddie was \u201cstroppy\u201d with him as they tinkered with his car. He put the moodiness down to work stress \u2013 Freddie had been pulling a lot of night shifts at Wilton carpet factory, where colleagues referred to him as a \u201cforklift\u201d, on account of how much he could carry.</p> \n<p>But Clifford felt blessed to have a health-conscious son; he didn\u2019t see anything to be alarmed about. A keen gym-goer, Freddie even gave up smoking at his parents\u2019 request. \u201cHe used to cook all his own food! He\u2019d cook a meal before he went to work ... he had two sets of scales, and he weighed all his vegetables, everything. He even kept notes of what he was eating and what he was doing.\u201d Clifford laughs, bitterly. \u201cExcept for the bloody drugs.\u201d</p> \n<p>And that is one of the issues of muscle dysmorphia \u2013 you can hide in plain sight. A pair of weighing scales in the kitchen; tupperware boxes of chicken and broccoli in your backpack. Most people view these as harmless, if idiosyncratic, behaviours. And when you look like you are hewn out of marble, it is hard to consider anything is amiss. It is only when you step past the facade that you realise these statue-like men are slowly destroying themselves.</p> \n<p>It is a silent epidemic \u2013 Olivardia estimates as many as 10% of men working out in gyms may be suffering, but never seek help. Lately, Tony has started taking illegal substances again, insisting \u201cit can be done safely\u201d. Clifford still has Freddie\u2019s weighing scales in the kitchen. Looking at them, he would probably disagree.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Some of the names in the piece have been changed</em></p> \n<p><em>Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

This wasn\u2019t always the case. \u201cIn the 70s, we saw very slim, almost androgynous men, like Mick Jagger and David Bowie ... to be muscular was to be defined as to be militaristic, at a time when, in the US, there were protests against the Vietnam war,\u201d says Dr Roberto Olivardia of Harvard Medical School, an expert in male body image. \u201cSo that build was really frowned on and rejected by youth culture. \u201cBut then the 80s came about, with figures like Ronald Reagan, who was pro-military, and men like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.\u201d This ideal male \u2013 hyper-masculine, militaristic, strong above all else \u2013 was exported globally through films such as First Blood (1982), Predator (1987) and The Terminator (1984). WWE wrestling was founded in 1980, and the likes of Hulk Hogan became celebrities. In the late 90s, a leaner but still very muscular aesthetic \u2013 popularised by Brad Pitt in the movie Fight Club \u2013 became fashionable. Today\u2019s muscle men stare down at us from the billboards of superhero films featuring stars such as Chris Hemsworth or Jason Momoa, the latter only last week body-shamed online after photographs emerged of him enjoying himself on holiday in fractionally less-than-superhero condition. On the small screen, the current crop of Love Island contestants mug for the cameras in tiny swimming trunks, all the better to display their perfect six-packs. However, just as fashion magazines don\u2019t cause anorexia, but contribute to a toxic environment in which extreme thinness is celebrated, Hulk Hogan, Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson and Chris Hemsworth are not to be blamed for the disordered behaviours sweeping our gyms. According to the NHS, we do not yet know what causes body dysmorphia disorders but genetics, a chemical imbalance in the brain or a traumatic experience in your past may play a part. You are also more likely to develop it if you were bullied or abused as a child, something student Nathaniel Shaw knows well. The 28-year-old was bullied at secondary school \u2013 they called him a Borrower, on account of his slender frame. \u201cI was always the small kid in the corner that no one wanted to speak to.\u201d Social acceptance came one squat press at a time. \u201cFrom where I\u2019m from in Nottingham, because it\u2019s a very rough place, you\u2019re training to protect yourself. The bigger guys are the serious people that no one wants to mess with. That was the main thing at the start \u2013 get big and be taken seriously.\u201d When Shaw went to college at age 17, he had a plan: work out all winter and reveal his buff body come summer. But when he took off his T-shirt playing football one afternoon, a girl said that Shaw \u201chad no chest\u201d. He instantly put his top back on. \u201cI still wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d The unkind comment laid waste to Shaw\u2019s fragile self-esteem; he walked away from the wreckage determined to become even more shredded. Shaw\u2019s life became: the gym, home to eat enormous portions of tuna, pasta and cheese, move as little as possible to conserve energy and repeat. Shaw detached from the contours of normal life. He stayed in bed longer, later and missed exams. He was depressed. \u201cThe pursuit of this muscular ideal takes over people\u2019s lives,\u201d explains Nagata. \u201cThey become obsessed with it. They can\u2019t function in their daily life outside of pursuing this ideal and it can lead to depression, missing school or work, and losing their ability to do basic living tasks.\u201d To an observer, Shaw \u2013 who weighed 80kg at 1.7 metres \u2013 was tank-like. But that wasn\u2019t how he saw himself. \u201cI would be in the gym and say: \u2018I look like shit.\u2019 Everyone would be like: \u2018No you don\u2019t, you\u2019re huge, I wish I could look like that.\u2019\u201d Muscle dysmorphia is a disease of perception. Although its sufferers live in the material world \u2013 a place of grunting exertion and weighted bags and scoopable protein powders \u2013 they spend most of their time in an imagined reality, where they are incalculably huge. Their biceps are swollen watermelons; each muscle as finely striated as the delicate contours of a seashell. But even if they eventually achieve that physique, it is not enough. As soon as one muscular ideal is achieved, a new goal appears. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying: \u2018Once you step into a gym, you\u2019re forever small,\u2019\u201d says 27-year-old Rich Selby, an amateur bodybuilder from Cardiff. Miles agrees. \u201cEvery muscle could be bigger. I could be leaner. You look at yourself and feel like everything is small and weak. I have no chest muscles; I have no arm muscles ... you\u2019re judging yourself against an impossible standard.\u201d Social media reflects this standard back at you. \u201cYou\u2019re being sold a false reality,\u201d says Miles. \u201cI can get into really good shape, right before I\u2019m doing a bodybuilding competition, and use lighting and angles and filters to make my physique look even crazier than it already is, and save a bunch of pictures and upload them to make it seem that I always look like that, all year round.\u201d Some turn to illegal substances to attain this ideal. Tony, 23, works for a pharmaceutical distributor in Dallas. He started taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs, including testosterone, equipoise and nandrolone, two years ago. The drugs created a dangerous feedback loop: the more he injected, the more his body changed and the more he took. \u201cPeople are like: \u2018Wow, that guy\u2019s a tank.\u2019 They have more respect for you ... I thought, heck yeah, I\u2019m going to take more so I can get even bigger.\u201d It is a common experience: muscle dysmorphia can be fuelled by the positive reinforcement men receive from other men in the gym. \u201cWhen you\u2019re large, you get a lot of respect,\u201d Selby confirms. Men come up to him and ask how much he can bench. Sometimes they try to start fights. \u201cThat\u2019s why people become addicted. They\u2019re insecure, so they need confirmation from other people.\u201d Selby self-identifies as having muscle dysmorphia, but believes that he has it under control, because he has good self-esteem. Up close, you can see the havoc muscle dysmorphia wreaks. \u201cYour interpersonal relationships fall apart \u2013 but you are so caught up in the endorphin rush of affirmation from your gym buddies, you barely notice,\u201d says Miles. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of an asshole. You don\u2019t realise it ... you just become this all-around grouch. It consumes not only all of your time and focus, but also the human part of you.\u201d It\u2019s also a lonely existence. All your time is spent preparing protein-rich food, but because you are over-exercising, you are often \u201chungry, and cranky, and don\u2019t sleep well\u201d. Among the young men Nagata surveyed, 2.8% had used illegal steroids, and it is estimated that up to 1 million Brits take performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cSteroids can lead to heart disease, kidney problems and liver damage,\u201d says Nagata. There are also mental health risks. \u201cPeople may have extreme irritability, aggression, paranoia and can be violent.\u201d Tony was one young man who used drugs to bulk up. He knew what he was doing was dangerous: he would even donate blood to get his blood pressure down. \u201cI just genuinely didn\u2019t care.\u201d As he cycled on and off drugs, he experienced dramatic mood swings. He got fired from his job at a hardware store for screaming at a coworker in the break room. Eventually, his mental health deteriorated so much that he came off all the drugs in May last year. What makes someone play Russian roulette with a steroid-filled syringe? Selby thinks people are driven to desperate measures because they cannot disassociate who they are from how they look. It\u2019s an obsession that can prove fatal. Freddie Dibben, 28, died in March 2017 after his heart became enlarged by the stimulant Clenbuterol. His father Clifford, 69, found him. \u201cThe hardest part was going back through to the kitchen and telling his mum what I found. It\u2019ll never go away.\u201d Like Tony, Freddie experienced mood swings. \u201cHe would snap at you,\u201d Clifford says, recalling an incident where Freddie was \u201cstroppy\u201d with him as they tinkered with his car. He put the moodiness down to work stress \u2013 Freddie had been pulling a lot of night shifts at Wilton carpet factory, where colleagues referred to him as a \u201cforklift\u201d, on account of how much he could carry. But Clifford felt blessed to have a health-conscious son; he didn\u2019t see anything to be alarmed about. A keen gym-goer, Freddie even gave up smoking at his parents\u2019 request. \u201cHe used to cook all his own food! He\u2019d cook a meal before he went to work ... he had two sets of scales, and he weighed all his vegetables, everything. He even kept notes of what he was eating and what he was doing.\u201d Clifford laughs, bitterly. \u201cExcept for the bloody drugs.\u201d And that is one of the issues of muscle dysmorphia \u2013 you can hide in plain sight. A pair of weighing scales in the kitchen; tupperware boxes of chicken and broccoli in your backpack. Most people view these as harmless, if idiosyncratic, behaviours. And when you look like you are hewn out of marble, it is hard to consider anything is amiss. It is only when you step past the facade that you realise these statue-like men are slowly destroying themselves. It is a silent epidemic \u2013 Olivardia estimates as many as 10% of men working out in gyms may be suffering, but never seek help. Lately, Tony has started taking illegal substances again, insisting \u201cit can be done safely\u201d. Clifford still has Freddie\u2019s weighing scales in the kitchen. Looking at them, he would probably disagree. \u2022 Some of the names in the piece have been changed Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

As the <a href=\"https://landforthemany.uk/\" title=\"\">Land for the Many report</a> (commissioned by the Labour party and edited by me) points out, we also need explicit policies to stabilise house prices and prevent homes from being treated as financial assets.

But they cannot be allowed to use their position as owners of a limited and non-reproducible resource (the land on which their houses sit) to extract private taxes from people much poorer than themselves. We claim to be a nation that values freedom. But freedom is currently the preserve of the rich.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",

If the number of homes had grown by 300,000 every year since 1996, the average house today would be only 7% cheaper. This is because of the economic decisions successive governments have made, ensuring that our surplus homes \u2013 and surplus rooms \u2013 are inaccessible to those who need them most. Yes, we need to build more social housing, but even a massive programme would take many years to counteract the effects of our pernicious system. As the Land for the Many report (commissioned by the Labour party and edited by me) points out, we also need explicit policies to stabilise house prices and prevent homes from being treated as financial assets. Among them are stiffer restrictions on evicting tenants and raising rents, stronger regulation of buy-to-let mortgages, a national register of landlords, with iron rules ensuring that the homes they offer are safe and fit, and higher rates of capital gains tax for additional homes. We will need private landlords for the foreseeable future, and they should be able to make some money from their property. But they cannot be allowed to use their position as owners of a limited and non-reproducible resource (the land on which their houses sit) to extract private taxes from people much poorer than themselves. We claim to be a nation that values freedom. But freedom is currently the preserve of the rich. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",

From late spring through to autumn, the high season for mycophiles, Russians fan out into the forests in search of fresh air, solitude and fungi to fill their wicker baskets. Should you see Ladas and Range Rovers abandoned roadside after a downpour, do not be alarmed: it is just mushroom season, not the zombie apocalypse.</p> \n<p>The prey depends on the season: morels in spring, then pine boletes, broad milkcaps, orange chanterelles and the prized <em>boroviki</em>, the porcinis or penny buns that crown the season before the first snowfalls.</p> \n<p>Yes, Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy wrote about mushroom hunts. But for a more hallucinogenic offering, turn to the Bolshevik functionary Alexander Tolstoy, who wrote a fairytale about talking mushrooms complaining how painful it is to be eaten, trampling a poisonous <em>mukhomor</em> and then shoving their way into the mouths of two children with the cry \u201cAll right, kids, open up!\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5183aa3b6375dd9125f12436e09ef3133a21d191\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5183aa3b6375dd9125f12436e09ef3133a21d191/0_0_4714_3037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ivanovo picking mushrooms in the forest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The \u2018quiet hunt\u2019 for mushrooms in the Ivanovo region of Russia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vladimir Smirnov/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Soviet labour unions sometimes rented out buses to send factory workers off for a day of mushroom picking as a kind of teambuilding exercise.

Each year, dozens of Russians go missing and only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/world/europe/27mushrooms.html\">stumble out weeks later</a> in a kind of trance state.

But twice a day, tens of thousands of people file into the city\u2019s largest Sikh temple, take their place on their floor and eat a simple meal of vegetables, daal and roti \u2013 without paying anything.</p> \n<p>The langar, or communal kitchen, is a pillar of the Sikh religion. At the Bangla Sahib gurudwara in Delhi, an estimated 35,000 people are fed each day in a ritual symbolising the faith\u2019s commitment to equality and eradicating hunger.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor everyone who comes it is free of cost,\u201d says Harbhej Singh, who runs the langar. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t divide anyone by caste, creed or culture.

It\u2019s predictably popular. Across ages, genders, mother tongues and ideologies, free public transport has become something that residents expect and value. The scheme has encouraged people to sign on as residents of Tallinn with the city\u2019s population registry. This has increased the tax base and improved revenues. Proponents of free public transportation in Tallinn have pointed to gains in the city\u2019s income that far outweigh the loss of fares.</p> \n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do without it,\u201d says Mari-Liis Kade, 20, a barista at the coffee chain Reval Caf\u00e9 in Tallinn\u2019s old town who commutes in from a suburb 10km away.</p> \n<p>\u201cYoung people generally don\u2019t earn much in Estonia by EU standards,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf you take home \u20ac300-\u20ac400 a month, which is common in the service industry, you can see why a free mode of transport is a great benefit.\u201d A ride on the bus or tram in Tallinn is \u20ac2 for non-residents.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"17f71d5564e88bb74c58fe70081eaa8d468ab95d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17f71d5564e88bb74c58fe70081eaa8d468ab95d/0_0_3184_2120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Free public transport in Tallinn, Estonia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Free public transport in Tallinn, Estonia, has improved the city\u2019s finances.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raigo Pajula/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not just the money,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s as much about convenience. It\u2019s great to just jump on the 1A bus, ping my (Tallinn Transport) card and not have to worry about the fare. I definitely use the bus more because it is convenient in my community but also for getting to other places. Tourists think of Tallinn as just the Old Town and centre but it\u2019s actually quite a spread-out city.\u201d</p> \n<p>And is free public transport alleviating traffic snarls? \u201cWell, the people of Tallinn are addicted to driving. I don\u2019t know how much it has helped with that. But for those of us without cars, free public transportation is a godsend. It definitely encourages my friends and I to go into the city more often.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-amundsen\">Michael Amundsen</a> in Tallinn</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Surely there are not enough fitness freaks to necessitate even a quarter of the pull-up bars, pec decks and leg-swinging contraptions that interrupt the view?</p> \n<p>But by evening, they are full. Dakarois take fitness seriously. Packs of men jog up and down the city\u2019s chinks of beach, turning shoal-like every 50 metres to cover the same ground hundreds of times. Other groups do aerobics, play football or wrestle as the traffic splutters past. The most creativity is brought to bear on elaborate synchronised press-up routines: with legs crossed one way then the other, elbows in then splayed out, then holding each other\u2019s legs aloft.</p> \n<p>On a recent weekday evening on Yoff beach, a group did frog jumps en masse, first forwards, then back. Wrestling is equally popular, and you will often find a ring of spectators egging on two skimpily-dressed but deadly serious men circling each other before launching themselves at each other\u2019s waists.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e236894bb47ccecd1a255e1874ceeae9a33371e3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e236894bb47ccecd1a255e1874ceeae9a33371e3/0_0_3500_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exercise on the beach in Dakar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On Dakar\u2019s beaches, groups do aerobics, play football or wrestle as the traffic splutters past.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finbarr O'Reilly/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At Dakar\u2019s biggest and most prestigious gym, the Olympique Club, staff confide that some of the country\u2019s most famous wrestlers often come to work out \u2013 but add that they preen a little more than they train.

I\u2019ve been doing it in the islands off northern Germany with my children ever since they were babies. Requirements are: the immediate aftermath of good storm, coupled with an onshore wind, after which you should make your way to the beach in the early morning to beat the other \u201cBernstein Fischer\u201d (amber anglers). Take a scoop net \u2013 known as a <em>kescher</em> \u2013 to drag over the sea bed, and if you\u2019re really serious, a pair of waders, or waterproofs that reach as far as your oxters and enable you to walk through the breakers, and possibly even a rope fastened to the shore to stop you being swept out to sea. Still keen?</p> \n<p>The idea is that a storm loosens the amber nuggets \u2013 believed to be around 44m years old \u2013 from the sea bed, and once it\u2019s relatively calm again, the \u201cgolden tears of the Baltic\u201d, as they are typically referred to, are either to be found floating among the concentration of disturbed shells, seaweed and driftwood or, if you\u2019re lucky, washed up on the beach.</p> \n<p>The most likely time of the year is between November and March, when storms are most common. The sea must be cold.</p> \n<p>Patience and luck is required to find the best gems, and the most magical finds include pieces with insects encased in them, or the rarer green moss amber, and sometimes even blue chunks. But we have always been thrilled by the tiniest find \u2013 some little bigger than a pinhead. Other orangey-coloured stones on the beach can easily be mistaken for amber. But its lightness, hollowness and softness (tapping them against your teeth and biting into them helps to identify the real stuff) helps distinguish them from stones and pebbles. Polished them up is as easy as using a duster dipped in dry washing powder, and rubbing it over the nugget.</p> \n<p>Make a hole in it (local amber shops are usually happy to do this for a small fee), insert a thread, and you have the perfect unique holiday souvenir.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kateconnolly\">Kate Connolly</a> in Berlin</p> \n<h2>Visual treats in Tokyo</h2> \n<p><br>Now that the dawn tuna auctions at Tsukiji fish market have moved to more clinical surroundings, arguably the best possible early start to a day in Tokyo is a visit to a sumo stable. Several <em>heya</em> allow visitors to sit in on training sessions, although reservations are recommended to guarantee getting close enough to take in the slapping of sweaty flesh and the sweet scent of the wrestlers\u2019 <em>bintsuke</em> hair oil. The Arashio stable has an English-language <a href=\"http://www.arashio.net/tour_e.html\">page</a> on its website, but restricts visitors to watching the action through a window.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8c2098ab5858dd9fc328f97fb94f714f7379901\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8c2098ab5858dd9fc328f97fb94f714f7379901/0_159_5231_3137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Famous cherry bloom, cherry blossom festival in the botanical garden in Kyoto, Japan, Asia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Japan\u2019s cities, you are never too far from a park or riverbank to indulge in a spot of cherry blossom viewing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: imageBROKER/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Keirin</em> is the best cycling sport you\u2019ve probably never heard of. The world\u2019s first keirin races were held in the southern Japanese city of Kokura (now Kitakyushu) more than seven decades ago, with betting receipts used to fund the country\u2019s postwar reconstruction. Its popularity among older men who enjoy a punt has saddled it with an image problem, but make no mistake, this is track cycling at its most brutal, with huge sums in prize money at stake for the best riders. Keirin tracks dot the suburbs of major cities, and admission is often free. Even when it isn\u2019t, it never costs more than 100 yen [74p] to pass through the turnstiles. And if the keirin gods are smiling, there is even the prospect of leaving the velodrome with a profit.</p> \n<p>Visitors arriving in Japan in the next few weeks will have to be incredibly unlucky not to catch a glimpse of the springtime <em>sakura</em> \u2013 or cherry blossoms \u2013 whose pale pink petals appear at different intervals the length of the archipelago. The blossoms\u2019 ubiquity means you are never far from a park or riverbank to indulge in a spot of <em>hanami</em> flower viewing and ponder the ephemeral nature of life as the petals float to the ground, not to be seen for another year.

In a city where the luxury mall is king, they serve as a spiritual counterbalance to the ever growing number of Louis Vuitton boutiques and on days when Bangkok feels overwhelmingly urban, I go and seek out some of the weirder and more wonderful ones.

It is a shrine dedicated to the power of the female and there is something both so endearing and so defiant about seeing the image of a goddess with hundreds of penises \u2013 big and small; hot pink, red, black, brown and ornately decorated; some piled up on a gold platter, laid out before her like a phallic congregation standing to attention.</p> \n<p>Another favourite is the shrine dedicated to Mae Nak, one of Thailand\u2019s most famous ghosts.

      "bodyText": "Mushrooms in Russia In Russia, mushroom picking is called the \u201cquiet hunt\u201d and it has a ritual all its own. From late spring through to autumn, the high season for mycophiles, Russians fan out into the forests in search of fresh air, solitude and fungi to fill their wicker baskets. Should you see Ladas and Range Rovers abandoned roadside after a downpour, do not be alarmed: it is just mushroom season, not the zombie apocalypse. The prey depends on the season: morels in spring, then pine boletes, broad milkcaps, orange chanterelles and the prized boroviki, the porcinis or penny buns that crown the season before the first snowfalls. Yes, Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy wrote about mushroom hunts. But for a more hallucinogenic offering, turn to the Bolshevik functionary Alexander Tolstoy, who wrote a fairytale about talking mushrooms complaining how painful it is to be eaten, trampling a poisonous mukhomor and then shoving their way into the mouths of two children with the cry \u201cAll right, kids, open up!\u201d Soviet labour unions sometimes rented out buses to send factory workers off for a day of mushroom picking as a kind of teambuilding exercise. But the quiet hunt is really about leaving everything behind \u2013 our troubles, our devices, and often our loved ones \u2013 and communing with forests of birch and pine until we emerge again, our burden a little lighter. Well, most of us emerge. Each year, dozens of Russians go missing and only stumble out weeks later in a kind of trance state. Others become so hopelessly lost that they are never found at all. \u2022 Andrew Roth in Moscow The langar in India Indians are born negotiators, and everything in Delhi has a price. But twice a day, tens of thousands of people file into the city\u2019s largest Sikh temple, take their place on their floor and eat a simple meal of vegetables, daal and roti \u2013 without paying anything. The langar, or communal kitchen, is a pillar of the Sikh religion. At the Bangla Sahib gurudwara in Delhi, an estimated 35,000 people are fed each day in a ritual symbolising the faith\u2019s commitment to equality and eradicating hunger. \u201cFor everyone who comes it is free of cost,\u201d says Harbhej Singh, who runs the langar. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t divide anyone by caste, creed or culture. It\u2019s for everyone.\u201d In a culture that has traditionally been riven by the caste system, an intricate south Asian social hierarchy whose rules include who can and cannot prepare food or eat together, the 500-year-old langar tradition is still a radical statement. \u201cThe main motive is to remove these class differences,\u201d Singh says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a foreigner, a minister, or anyone, they all sit together. A beggar might be sitting next to you, but you both eat.\u201d Preparing the meal involves thousands of volunteers as well as staggering quantities of food. On an average day, the kitchens prepare 450kg of lentils, 1,800kg of flour, 300kg or rice and 900kg of vegetables, most of it garnered through donations. And will the temple ever start charging? Singh is emphatic. \u201cIt will never happen.\u201d \u2022 Michael Safi in Delhi Public transport in Estonia When the initiative to make public transport free for residents in Estonia\u2019s capital Tallinn was introduced six years ago, it was seen as something of a throwback to the communist era. No matter. It\u2019s predictably popular. Across ages, genders, mother tongues and ideologies, free public transport has become something that residents expect and value. The scheme has encouraged people to sign on as residents of Tallinn with the city\u2019s population registry. This has increased the tax base and improved revenues. Proponents of free public transportation in Tallinn have pointed to gains in the city\u2019s income that far outweigh the loss of fares. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do without it,\u201d says Mari-Liis Kade, 20, a barista at the coffee chain Reval Caf\u00e9 in Tallinn\u2019s old town who commutes in from a suburb 10km away. \u201cYoung people generally don\u2019t earn much in Estonia by EU standards,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf you take home \u20ac300-\u20ac400 a month, which is common in the service industry, you can see why a free mode of transport is a great benefit.\u201d A ride on the bus or tram in Tallinn is \u20ac2 for non-residents. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just the money,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s as much about convenience. It\u2019s great to just jump on the 1A bus, ping my (Tallinn Transport) card and not have to worry about the fare. I definitely use the bus more because it is convenient in my community but also for getting to other places. Tourists think of Tallinn as just the Old Town and centre but it\u2019s actually quite a spread-out city.\u201d And is free public transport alleviating traffic snarls? \u201cWell, the people of Tallinn are addicted to driving. I don\u2019t know how much it has helped with that. But for those of us without cars, free public transportation is a godsend. It definitely encourages my friends and I to go into the city more often.\u201d \u2022 Michael Amundsen in Tallinn Open-air workouts in Senegal A hazy dusk descends on Dakar\u2019s coastal strip as hundreds of men and women work out, undeterred by the heady blend of harmattan dust and diesel fumes. Recently, China gave Senegal an improbable number of outdoor fitness machines \u2013 a vast row of glinting seafront metal. Surely there are not enough fitness freaks to necessitate even a quarter of the pull-up bars, pec decks and leg-swinging contraptions that interrupt the view? But by evening, they are full. Dakarois take fitness seriously. Packs of men jog up and down the city\u2019s chinks of beach, turning shoal-like every 50 metres to cover the same ground hundreds of times. Other groups do aerobics, play football or wrestle as the traffic splutters past. The most creativity is brought to bear on elaborate synchronised press-up routines: with legs crossed one way then the other, elbows in then splayed out, then holding each other\u2019s legs aloft. On a recent weekday evening on Yoff beach, a group did frog jumps en masse, first forwards, then back. Wrestling is equally popular, and you will often find a ring of spectators egging on two skimpily-dressed but deadly serious men circling each other before launching themselves at each other\u2019s waists. At Dakar\u2019s biggest and most prestigious gym, the Olympique Club, staff confide that some of the country\u2019s most famous wrestlers often come to work out \u2013 but add that they preen a little more than they train. Senegalese boys are as likely to tell you that they want to be wrestlers as footballers, which goes some way to explain the citywide pursuit of \u201cmusculation\u201d. Often sensible of gifts that are likely to be popular, China has cottoned onto that too \u2013 their donation of a large wrestling arena was inaugurated in Dakar last summer. \u2022 Ruth Maclean in Dakar Amber fishing in Germany Amber fishing is a popular pastime for visitors to the Baltic Sea coast. I\u2019ve been doing it in the islands off northern Germany with my children ever since they were babies. Requirements are: the immediate aftermath of good storm, coupled with an onshore wind, after which you should make your way to the beach in the early morning to beat the other \u201cBernstein Fischer\u201d (amber anglers). Take a scoop net \u2013 known as a kescher \u2013 to drag over the sea bed, and if you\u2019re really serious, a pair of waders, or waterproofs that reach as far as your oxters and enable you to walk through the breakers, and possibly even a rope fastened to the shore to stop you being swept out to sea. Still keen? The idea is that a storm loosens the amber nuggets \u2013 believed to be around 44m years old \u2013 from the sea bed, and once it\u2019s relatively calm again, the \u201cgolden tears of the Baltic\u201d, as they are typically referred to, are either to be found floating among the concentration of disturbed shells, seaweed and driftwood or, if you\u2019re lucky, washed up on the beach. The most likely time of the year is between November and March, when storms are most common. The sea must be cold. Patience and luck is required to find the best gems, and the most magical finds include pieces with insects encased in them, or the rarer green moss amber, and sometimes even blue chunks. But we have always been thrilled by the tiniest find \u2013 some little bigger than a pinhead. Other orangey-coloured stones on the beach can easily be mistaken for amber. But its lightness, hollowness and softness (tapping them against your teeth and biting into them helps to identify the real stuff) helps distinguish them from stones and pebbles. Polished them up is as easy as using a duster dipped in dry washing powder, and rubbing it over the nugget. Make a hole in it (local amber shops are usually happy to do this for a small fee), insert a thread, and you have the perfect unique holiday souvenir. \u2022 Kate Connolly in Berlin Visual treats in Tokyo Now that the dawn tuna auctions at Tsukiji fish market have moved to more clinical surroundings, arguably the best possible early start to a day in Tokyo is a visit to a sumo stable. Several heya allow visitors to sit in on training sessions, although reservations are recommended to guarantee getting close enough to take in the slapping of sweaty flesh and the sweet scent of the wrestlers\u2019 bintsuke hair oil. The Arashio stable has an English-language page on its website, but restricts visitors to watching the action through a window. Keirin is the best cycling sport you\u2019ve probably never heard of. The world\u2019s first keirin races were held in the southern Japanese city of Kokura (now Kitakyushu) more than seven decades ago, with betting receipts used to fund the country\u2019s postwar reconstruction. Its popularity among older men who enjoy a punt has saddled it with an image problem, but make no mistake, this is track cycling at its most brutal, with huge sums in prize money at stake for the best riders. Keirin tracks dot the suburbs of major cities, and admission is often free. Even when it isn\u2019t, it never costs more than 100 yen [74p] to pass through the turnstiles. And if the keirin gods are smiling, there is even the prospect of leaving the velodrome with a profit. Visitors arriving in Japan in the next few weeks will have to be incredibly unlucky not to catch a glimpse of the springtime sakura \u2013 or cherry blossoms \u2013 whose pale pink petals appear at different intervals the length of the archipelago. The blossoms\u2019 ubiquity means you are never far from a park or riverbank to indulge in a spot of hanami flower viewing and ponder the ephemeral nature of life as the petals float to the ground, not to be seen for another year. A Japanese picnic and a plentiful supply of beer and sake are optional, but recommended. \u2022 Justin McCurry in Tokyo Generous grannies in Spain They move with a stealth and speed that belies their years, materialising suddenly at pedestrian crossings, on cafe terraces and in tube carriages. They carry sweets, gooey compliments and, above all, centuries of accumulated wisdom and opinion. They are the grandmothers of Spain, and they are not shy. Undoubtedly the most assiduous worshippers of children in a country where kids possess semi-divine status no matter how infernal their true natures, the abuelas are always keen to talk, ruffle hair and magic up tissues for snotty young noses. Their chief function, however, is the imparting of parenting advice \u2013 whether solicited or not. God help the mother or father who dares to venture out without wrapping their offspring in at least two more layers than is strictly necessary. Being a guiri (foreigner) will not serve as mitigation. There is something wonderful about these daily displays of affection and about the way old and young communicate in Spain. To be a child here is to be seen, to be heard and to be engaged with. And, obviously, to be fussed over relentlessly. I sometimes wonder whether the children and the grannies don\u2019t share some secret signal long lost to the eyes and ears of the generation that sits between them. Perhaps it is something learned, forgotten and then rediscovered over the course of a life. Perhaps it\u2019s just the smell of sweets. \u2022 Sam Jones in Madrid The phallic shrine in Bangkok Shrines are scattered across Bangkok, dedicated to deities, gods, ghosts and spirits. In a city where the luxury mall is king, they serve as a spiritual counterbalance to the ever growing number of Louis Vuitton boutiques and on days when Bangkok feels overwhelmingly urban, I go and seek out some of the weirder and more wonderful ones. And the Chao Mae Tubtim shrine is certainly weird, and certainly wonderful. The modest shrine, tucked away in a park in the hectic centre of Bangkok, is dedicated to the Chinese fertility goddess Tubtim, and since 1920 has been where women hoping to conceive have come with a phallic offering \u2013 mostly in the form of a penis sculpture. It is a shrine dedicated to the power of the female and there is something both so endearing and so defiant about seeing the image of a goddess with hundreds of penises \u2013 big and small; hot pink, red, black, brown and ornately decorated; some piled up on a gold platter, laid out before her like a phallic congregation standing to attention. Another favourite is the shrine dedicated to Mae Nak, one of Thailand\u2019s most famous ghosts. As the myth goes, she was so in love with her husband that when she died in childbirth she returned to the world and pretended to him she was still alive \u2013 until unfortunately he noticed she could walk through solid objects. Then there is Trimurti shrine, known as the lovers\u2019 shrine and always strewn with red roses: a joy to encounter in the midst of a crowded, polluted Bangkok junction. In a city of chaos, the shrines offer a moment of stillness. And whether I\u2019m sitting in the company of a lovesick ghost or in a sea of phalluses, they offer a window into the spiritual side of Thai society that can otherwise be easy to miss. \u2022 Hannah Ellis-Petersen in Bangkok Festivals in France From summer outdoor cinema in deckchairs in northern Paris to December\u2019s monumental, nocturnal light creations in central Lyon, France has a vast array of free festivals all year long. The Atlantide international book festival held in the western city of Nantes in early spring each year \u2013 and currently run by the acclaimed Congolese novelist Alain Mabanckou \u2013 is among the best literary festivals in Europe, attracting top writers. And it doesn\u2019t cost a cent to attend. Local festivals such as the F\u00eates d\u2019Arvor in Vannes, southern Brittany, are about celebrating regional traditions and culture. Others such as the Techno Parade in Paris each September are more about hundreds of thousands of fans taking over the city centre in a giant, free street party. The Parc de la Villette in northern Paris stages a summer free open-air cinema where people can bring their own picnics and watch films from Yellow Submarine to La La Land. In October, Paris also stages its Nuit Blanche nocturnal art trail, where people roam the city into the early hours looking at art installations in buildings and courtyards that they might not otherwise have access to. Even France\u2019s more than 16,000 public libraries \u2013 over four times the number of libraries in the UK \u2013 regularly stage their own free events, such as the Paris libraries which decamp to parks on certain days in summer. Many of the most popular festivals are in smaller locations, like Saint-Louis on the Swiss border, well known for its free summer open-air music festival, Con\u00e7-Air. Lyon\u2019s December Festival of Lights \u2013 one of the region\u2019s key tourism events \u2013 sees top artists create giant, cutting-edge light projections and installations in the city centre.

      "body": "<p>The early June morning in Montana was already very hot and dry by 7.30, when Clayton Phipps and his friend, Mark Eatman, set out to search for fossils. Phipps, a rancher who calls himself the Dino Cowboy, was wearing his trademark black felt Stetson cattleman hat.</p> <p>The two had gone bone collecting before, but they were joined on this day for the first time by Phipps\u2019s cousin, Chad O\u2019Connor. The trio fanned out to hike through the badlands of what they thought was the Judith River Formation; later, they would learn they had actually been in an area called Hell Creek, a division of gray and ochre sandstone, shale and clay deposited about 66m years ago during the Late Cretaceous, when the area was a swampy floodplain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/shortcuts/2019/apr/17/t-rex-traders-should-the-sale-of-dinosaur-bones-be-stopped\">T rex traders: should the sale of dinosaur bones be stopped?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Phipps, like most locals, calls it the Hell Crik<em>.</em> It\u2019s one of the most storied dinosaur fossil sites in the world.</p> <p>At lunchtime, the group reconvened for roast beef sandwiches. Phipps asked Eatman if he had found anything. Yes, he said\u2060, a pelvis weathering out of a hill \u2013 not a big deal, except this one appeared to have an articulated femur, potentially suggesting a rare level of completeness. They went to the site. Phipps could tell right away it was from a ceratopsian, a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs. He brushed away some of the sand, and thought there might be more of the dinosaur buried in the hillside.</p> <p>But excavating it would have to wait for another day: he had 260 acres of hay to cut for cattle feed.</p> <p>Eatman went back to Billings, where he had gotten a job at a carpet store after a run of bad luck put an end to his 13-year career as a full-time fossil hunter. (\u201cHis wife said: \u2018We\u2019re starving to death \u2013 you gotta get a real job,\u2019\u201d Phipps recalls.)</p> <p>O\u2019Connor and Phipps headed home to Phipps\u2019s ranch. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that excited,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a pelvis in the ground at the bottom of a canyon that was really remote and no roads to it at all. We had no plans to go back, but Chad convinced us to. I\u2019m sure glad we did.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"782ecfe240d54f86e99b39a2690a7f0811adf2b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/782ecfe240d54f86e99b39a2690a7f0811adf2b0/0_139_1536_1899/809.jpg\" alt=\"The site in Montana is one of the most storied dinosaur fossil sites in the world.\" width=\"809\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The site in Montana is one of the most storied dinosaur fossil sites in the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clayton Phillips</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Phipps and O\u2019Connor returned to the site about a month later, this time with Lige and Mary Ann Murray, ranchers who owned the land where the bones had been found. In the US, fossils found on private land belong to the landowner; prospectors simply need their permission to dig. The Murrays signed off, and Phipps and O\u2019Connor got to work. They built a road to the site. They began excavating the ceratopsian with penknives and brushes. Business partners were brought in; secret contracts were arranged. Eatman came to help when he could, along with a rotating cast of confidants.</p> <p>After two weeks, the body of the plant-eater had been revealed. It was more than a pelvis and femur \u2013 it looked like a fairly complete skeleton of <em>Triceratops horridus</em>, which is the triceratops you\u2019re thinking of. One day, Phipps was behind the wheel of his uncle\u2019s backhoe, scooping out soil from around the fossil so it could be removed. Carefully watching each dump of the bucket, at one point he noticed dark fragments among the light-colored sandstone.</p> <p>Bone chips.</p> <p>Oh no, he thought. He jumped down, combed through the sand, found the claw of a theropod. Theropods, like <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, are three-toed carnivores. That doesn\u2019t match the plant-eater, Phipps thought.

      "bodyText": "The early June morning in Montana was already very hot and dry by 7.30, when Clayton Phipps and his friend, Mark Eatman, set out to search for fossils. Phipps, a rancher who calls himself the Dino Cowboy, was wearing his trademark black felt Stetson cattleman hat. The two had gone bone collecting before, but they were joined on this day for the first time by Phipps\u2019s cousin, Chad O\u2019Connor. The trio fanned out to hike through the badlands of what they thought was the Judith River Formation; later, they would learn they had actually been in an area called Hell Creek, a division of gray and ochre sandstone, shale and clay deposited about 66m years ago during the Late Cretaceous, when the area was a swampy floodplain. Phipps, like most locals, calls it the Hell Crik. It\u2019s one of the most storied dinosaur fossil sites in the world. At lunchtime, the group reconvened for roast beef sandwiches. Phipps asked Eatman if he had found anything. Yes, he said\u2060, a pelvis weathering out of a hill \u2013 not a big deal, except this one appeared to have an articulated femur, potentially suggesting a rare level of completeness. They went to the site. Phipps could tell right away it was from a ceratopsian, a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs. He brushed away some of the sand, and thought there might be more of the dinosaur buried in the hillside. But excavating it would have to wait for another day: he had 260 acres of hay to cut for cattle feed. Eatman went back to Billings, where he had gotten a job at a carpet store after a run of bad luck put an end to his 13-year career as a full-time fossil hunter. (\u201cHis wife said: \u2018We\u2019re starving to death \u2013 you gotta get a real job,\u2019\u201d Phipps recalls.) O\u2019Connor and Phipps headed home to Phipps\u2019s ranch. \u201cWe weren\u2019t all that excited,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a pelvis in the ground at the bottom of a canyon that was really remote and no roads to it at all. We had no plans to go back, but Chad convinced us to. I\u2019m sure glad we did.\u201d Phipps and O\u2019Connor returned to the site about a month later, this time with Lige and Mary Ann Murray, ranchers who owned the land where the bones had been found. In the US, fossils found on private land belong to the landowner; prospectors simply need their permission to dig. The Murrays signed off, and Phipps and O\u2019Connor got to work. They built a road to the site. They began excavating the ceratopsian with penknives and brushes. Business partners were brought in; secret contracts were arranged. Eatman came to help when he could, along with a rotating cast of confidants. After two weeks, the body of the plant-eater had been revealed. It was more than a pelvis and femur \u2013 it looked like a fairly complete skeleton of Triceratops horridus, which is the triceratops you\u2019re thinking of. One day, Phipps was behind the wheel of his uncle\u2019s backhoe, scooping out soil from around the fossil so it could be removed. Carefully watching each dump of the bucket, at one point he noticed dark fragments among the light-colored sandstone. Bone chips. Oh no, he thought. He jumped down, combed through the sand, found the claw of a theropod. Theropods, like Tyrannosaurus rex, are three-toed carnivores. That doesn\u2019t match the plant-eater, Phipps thought. What is happening here? Phipps scrambled down into the quarry where he had been digging and brushed away more sand. A hand appeared. Then a leg. It was clear: there was another dinosaur in the outcrop. \u201cIt was just surreal,\u201d Phelps remembers. \u201cObviously, these two dinosaurs weren\u2019t friends, so what were they doing in there together?\u201d Phipps had been hunting for dinosaur fossils since 1998, excavating and preparing them to sell at trade shows and to museums and private collectors. But he had never found anything like this. \u201cI think,\u201d he says, \u201cmy hat went in the air that day.\u201d This was in 2006. Three months of intensive excavation followed, during which Phipps lost 15 pounds. In the end, he and his partners had a 28ft-long ceratopsian and a 22ft-long theropod in four multi-ton blocks. \u201cA little cowboy ingenuity, and we got \u2019em out of the hills,\u201d Phipps says. The meat-eater was either a juvenile T rex or its relative, Nanotyrannus lancensis, a rare dwarf species whose existence is disputed. Both dinosaurs were extraordinarily well-preserved, fully articulated, with envelopes of skin and, possibly, mummified internal organs. Best of all, they seemed to have died together, not washed into their grave separately. And they appeared to have been battling when they died: teeth were found in the spine and near the pelvis of the ceratopsian, and the theropod\u2019s skull was split laterally, as if it had been kicked. Phipps dubbed them the Montana Dueling Dinosaurs. \u201cThey\u2019re remarkable specimens,\u201d says Mark Norell, chairman of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. \u201cEspecially the tyrannosaur \u2013 it could go a long way toward resolving whether nanotyrannus was its own species.\u201d Thirteen years later, the number of people who have seen the fossils remains in the low double digits. They\u2019ve still not been fully extracted from the rock matrix, cleaned, prepped, studied or put on display. Phipps isn\u2019t even at liberty to say where they are \u2013 he\u2019ll only reveal that they\u2019re at an American museum, pending the resolution of Murray v BEJ Minerals LLC, which deals with who owns what\u2019s on top of the land versus what\u2019s beneath it. \u201cDinosaurs bring drama,\u201d Phipps says, \u201cand being a cowboy, I\u2019m not a drama fan. You can have it.\u201d For years after unearthing the Dueling Dinosaurs, Phipps and his team tried every tactic they could think of to drum up interest for a sale. They set up a website, and a marketing campaign called the Paleo-Incident Project. They tried to get sponsors, like Dr Pepper, to fund further work on the fossils. They posted videos on YouTube, men in western wear standing around the fossil jackets, taking turns talking into microphones. They contacted natural history museums around the world, including the Smithsonian \u2013 where the bones were offered for a reported $15m \u2013 and the Museum of the Rockies, in Bozeman, Montana, whose then head paleontologist, Jack Horner (the inspiration for the character played by Sam Neill in Jurassic Park) told them they were scientifically useless. \u201cIn order for a specimen to be of scientific use and publishable, we have to know its exact geographic position, its exact stratigraphic position, and the specimen must also be in the public trust, accessible for study, which this specimen is not,\u201d Horner says. Phipps called Horner\u2019s reaction \u201csad\u201d, adding: \u201cIf somebody in his position is telling the world that the best dinosaurs possibly ever discovered in the world are worthless, what donor\u2019s gonna donate anything to paleontology?\u201d Acrimony between commercial and academic paleontologists is abundant. \u201cThe haters are always gonna hate,\u201d Phipps says. \u201cNo question about that.\u201d In the meantime, other valuable dinosaur fossils were found on the 27,000-acre Murray ranch, including a well-preserved triceratops skull and nearly complete adult T rex, which a Dutch museum purchased for several million dollars.

Though the fossils technically belonged to the Murrays, they ceded control of what to do with them to Phipps and his team via a contract, the details of which remain private. \u201cWe have a pretty loose arrangement, to be real truthful,\u201d Mary Ann says. The deal specifies that any proceeds be split between the Murrays and Phipps; Phipps will then subdivide his percentage with his team, which includes the owners of CK Preparations, a commercial fossil services company, and Peter Larson of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, which has unearthed some of the most complete T rex specimens ever found. Larson\u2019s story is also one of loss. After the T rex known as \u201cSue\u201d was discovered by Black Hills in 1990, a dispute arose over its legal ownership. Two years later, the bones were seized by the FBI and South Dakota national guard in a highly publicized case, and ownership was returned to the landowner, a Sioux rancher whose deed was held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He sold Sue at auction for a record $8.36m to the Field Museum in Chicago.

His experience with the legal morass around dinosaur fossils would prove useful later.

The oldest dated human burial site in North America is near present-day Wilsall, Montana. For millions of years before that, the uplift of the Laramide orogeny, which created the Rocky Mountains in the west, was depositing thousands of feet of sediment in what is now eastern Montana, creating the rare conditions needed to fossilize the remains of the terrible lizards that had roamed that land long before, for humans to later find and fight over. But that was then. This is now. \u201cTo get it down in cowboy terms, I\u2019m getting an education in our justice system I never wanted to pay for,\u201d Phipps says. \u201cI\u2019m in my 40s and I\u2019d never needed an attorney until this.

Insecure tenancies and expensive rents mean that very often it is not a suitable tenure for older people. \u201cMany older people today were lucky enough to be able to buy their own home and watch the value of it grow. But for the pensioners of tomorrow there is little chance of being able to do that,\u201d he added. \u201cThe broken housing market and failure of past governments to adequately fund social housing means that we are going to see many more older people struggling to pay the rent.\u201d Kate Henderson, the chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said: \u201cThere is now a rapidly growing number of older people who are struggling just as much as the younger generation. This must be a wakeup call to the government that more money for building social housing, and especially housing that is fit for retirement, is desperately needed. \u201cOur latest research shows that the government must invest \u00a312.8bn in building new social housing every year if they are to ensure all generations have somewhere secure and affordable to live.\u201d George McNamara, the director of policy and influencing at Independent Age, said: \u201cOur research has shown that the lives of too many older renters are blighted by insecure tenancies, woeful living conditions, dealing with unscrupulous landlords and constant financial stress.\u201d Caroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK, agreed, adding: \u201cThe government needs to also invest more in good-quality social rented housing that offers security, affordability and independence to people who need it.\u201d Dr Rachael Docking, senior programme manager for homes at the Centre for Ageing Better, said: \u201cWe have an urgent challenge on our hands to prevent people in later life being pushed into poverty or trapped in unsuitable housing in the years to come.\u201d Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cThis country is failing to build social homes at the rate we need them, leaving older generations who missed the homeownership boat with little choice but to rent privately. \u201cOn top of being notoriously expensive and unstable, too many privately rented homes simply aren\u2019t up to scratch either \u2013 condemning older people to live out their retirement in places which are cold, damp or infested with mice.\u201d The housing minister, Heather Wheeler, said: \u201cWe have given councils more than \u00a32.7bn since 2012-13 so that people, including older and disabled people, can live independently and safely at home. \u201cThe recent introduction of the Homes Act means a fairer deal for both tenants and landlords as we strengthen all tenants\u2019 rights.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Tucked behind a busy north London road, the UK\u2019s first \u201csafe space\u201d for child sexual abuse victims is an oasis of calm. Set over two floors, the building is airy and light. </p> <p>The toxic legacy of child abuse gets minimal attention, yet the problem amounts to a<a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/pre-2013/sexual-abuse-public-health-challenge/\" title=\"\"> public health </a><a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/pre-2013/sexual-abuse-public-health-challenge/\" title=\"\">challenge</a>, say experts. Although we don\u2019t know exactly how many children in the UK experience sexual abuse as it\u2019s hidden from view, research suggests <a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/research-resources/statistics-briefings/child-sexual-abuse/\" title=\"\">one in 20 children</a> have been sexually abused, yet many more incidents go undetected, unreported and untreated.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/ServiceA-Z/CYPS/lighthouse/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">The Lighthouse</a> hopes to help change that. Launched in October 2018, the \u00a38m service provides a space to support young people up to the age of 18, and 18- to 25-year-olds with learning disabilities. When a child or young person discloses sexual abuse, they are often left to navigate the system by themselves and will have to retell the story several times to different professionals. The experience can be traumatic and lengthy, and it leads to few convictions.</p> <p>In the Lighthouse, however, all the services needed \u2013 medical, social care, advocacy, police and therapeutic support \u2013 are housed under one roof.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/01/you-grow-up-hating-yourself-why-child-abuse-survivors-keep-and-break-their-silence\">'You grow up hating yourself': why child abuse survivors keep \u2013 and break \u2013 their silence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nine months into a two-year pilot, the centre has the capacity to support 500 young people each year. Available to families in five north London boroughs, the services are provided by the University College London Hospitals (UCLH) trust in partnership with The Tavistock &amp; Portman NHS Foundation Trust, NSPCC, Metropolitan Police, domestic violence charity, Solace, and Camden council, and the centre receives around 35 referrals per month from social care, schools, police and parents. Young people over 13 years can also refer themselves, though the numbers are low.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re nimbler, and much more responsive,\u201d explains Emma Harewood, the Lighthouse\u2019s delivery and service manager , and the mastermind behind the project. While demand for <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/about/campaigns/bright-futures/bright-futures-camhs/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-and\" title=\"\">child</a><a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/about/campaigns/bright-futures/bright-futures-camhs/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-and\" title=\"\"> and adolescent mental health services (Camhs</a>) has increased, the government has cut <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/about/campaigns/bright-futures/bright-futures-camhs/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-and\" title=\"\">almost \u00a3500</a><a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/about/campaigns/bright-futures/bright-futures-camhs/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-and\" title=\"\">m since 2013 from services providing early intervention support</a>. Even if you report sexual abuse, you\u2019re likely to have to wait months for therapy and support.</p> <p>Yet the Lighthouse can see children in a matter of weeks. This is largely due to its multi-agency approach and funding. More than half (\u00a34.5m) came from the Home Office, while the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime, NHS England and the Department for Education also contributed. Additional services are provided by the NSPCC through partnership funding with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Each child\u2019s route through the service will vary. Lucy, 17, was referred by children\u2019s services after finally telling her mum about the long-term rape and sexual assault she\u2019d been subjected to at home by her dad. She met the Lighthouse\u2019s in-house social workers to relay her experience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'It feels like I'm organising my brain. It was all a mess but I can see things are getting tidied up.'</p> <footer> <cite>13-year-old girl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt the first assessment, we make sure we\u2019ve got the core people in the room and aim to minimise retraumatising the child,\u201d explains Martin Slack, the centre\u2019s social care liaison officer.</p> <p>Lucy will also meet an advocate, whose job is to guide her; whether it\u2019s help with the court process or support around housing. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been violated, your autonomy is compromised,\u201d explains Anna Weedon, one of the first advocates at the Lighthouse. \u201cWe give the young person a bit of control back and make sure they\u2019re being heard.\u201d</p> <p>Next is the interview, which is often the only source of evidence in sexual abuse cases. They are typically led by police officers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/18/review-child-sex-abuse-victims-police-hmcpsi-hmic\" title=\"\">settings that are rarely child-friendly</a>. At the Lighthouse, however, young people are interviewed by clinical psychologists, which is \u201creally quite radical,\u201d says Harewood.</p> <p>It follows a model known as Barnahus (child house), pioneered in Iceland 20 years ago and then launched in Sweden, Norway, Greenland and Denmark. The system is recognised as international best practice because it\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Barnahus-Improving-the-response-to-child-sexual-abuse-in-England.pdf\" title=\"\"> child-centric</a> and achieves the most effective results.</p> <p>In Iceland, the change has been startling. The number of convictions <a href=\"https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Barnahus-Improving-the-response-to-child-sexual-abuse-in-England.pdf\" title=\"\">doubled </a>between 1995-97 and 2011-13, and the system is proven to reduce children\u2019s trauma and gather better evidence from interviews for court.</p> <p>In the UK, the Lighthouse has taken elements of the model such as the psychology-led interview.

      "bodyText": "Tucked behind a busy north London road, the UK\u2019s first \u201csafe space\u201d for child sexual abuse victims is an oasis of calm. Set over two floors, the building is airy and light. The toxic legacy of child abuse gets minimal attention, yet the problem amounts to a public health challenge, say experts. Although we don\u2019t know exactly how many children in the UK experience sexual abuse as it\u2019s hidden from view, research suggests one in 20 children have been sexually abused, yet many more incidents go undetected, unreported and untreated. The Lighthouse hopes to help change that. Launched in October 2018, the \u00a38m service provides a space to support young people up to the age of 18, and 18- to 25-year-olds with learning disabilities. When a child or young person discloses sexual abuse, they are often left to navigate the system by themselves and will have to retell the story several times to different professionals. The experience can be traumatic and lengthy, and it leads to few convictions. In the Lighthouse, however, all the services needed \u2013 medical, social care, advocacy, police and therapeutic support \u2013 are housed under one roof. Nine months into a two-year pilot, the centre has the capacity to support 500 young people each year. Available to families in five north London boroughs, the services are provided by the University College London Hospitals (UCLH) trust in partnership with The Tavistock &amp; Portman NHS Foundation Trust, NSPCC, Metropolitan Police, domestic violence charity, Solace, and Camden council, and the centre receives around 35 referrals per month from social care, schools, police and parents. Young people over 13 years can also refer themselves, though the numbers are low. \u201cWe\u2019re nimbler, and much more responsive,\u201d explains Emma Harewood, the Lighthouse\u2019s delivery and service manager , and the mastermind behind the project. While demand for child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) has increased, the government has cut almost \u00a3500m since 2013 from services providing early intervention support. Even if you report sexual abuse, you\u2019re likely to have to wait months for therapy and support. Yet the Lighthouse can see children in a matter of weeks. This is largely due to its multi-agency approach and funding. More than half (\u00a34.5m) came from the Home Office, while the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime, NHS England and the Department for Education also contributed. Additional services are provided by the NSPCC through partnership funding with Morgan Stanley. Each child\u2019s route through the service will vary. Lucy, 17, was referred by children\u2019s services after finally telling her mum about the long-term rape and sexual assault she\u2019d been subjected to at home by her dad. She met the Lighthouse\u2019s in-house social workers to relay her experience. \u201cAt the first assessment, we make sure we\u2019ve got the core people in the room and aim to minimise retraumatising the child,\u201d explains Martin Slack, the centre\u2019s social care liaison officer. Lucy will also meet an advocate, whose job is to guide her; whether it\u2019s help with the court process or support around housing. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been violated, your autonomy is compromised,\u201d explains Anna Weedon, one of the first advocates at the Lighthouse. \u201cWe give the young person a bit of control back and make sure they\u2019re being heard.\u201d Next is the interview, which is often the only source of evidence in sexual abuse cases. They are typically led by police officers in settings that are rarely child-friendly. At the Lighthouse, however, young people are interviewed by clinical psychologists, which is \u201creally quite radical,\u201d says Harewood. It follows a model known as Barnahus (child house), pioneered in Iceland 20 years ago and then launched in Sweden, Norway, Greenland and Denmark. The system is recognised as international best practice because it\u2019s child-centric and achieves the most effective results. In Iceland, the change has been startling. The number of convictions doubled between 1995-97 and 2011-13, and the system is proven to reduce children\u2019s trauma and gather better evidence from interviews for court. In the UK, the Lighthouse has taken elements of the model such as the psychology-led interview. The discussion is filmed by discreet cameras, and watched by the police officer leading the investigation from a connecting room. To get the best interview, the psychologist will ask open, non-leading questions. They\u2019ll also say things like: \u201cRemember, I wasn\u2019t there\u201d to signal to the child that they \u2013 not the adult \u2013 are the expert here. \u201cYou\u2019re having to ask questions that can feel difficult, but if you don\u2019t ask them the defence will,\u201d explains Anna Churcher Clarke, a clinical psychologist at the Lighthouse. \u201cIf there were other adults in the house, for example, and the child is saying they didn\u2019t want the abuse to happen, you might ask: You didn\u2019t leave the room at that point, why was that?

Since the five-day-a-week safe space launched, referrals have shot up, from 80 to 264 cases a year, with an expected 425 by year-end. Based on the pilot\u2019s success, Harewood hopes more centres will open. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest nationally \u2013 we\u2019ve had inquiries from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,\u201d she says.

The Lighthouse is fully supported by the government, but is not a statutory service as the Barnahus are in Iceland and Scandinavia. Still, it\u2019s hard to ignore the maths. Child sexual abuse is estimated to cost the UK \u00a33.2bn a year \u2013 it can be associated with eating disorders, self-harm, addiction to alcohol or drugs, PTSD, depression and suicide.

There are people working with police on one side, and then on the flip side, the police are investigating these people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s counterproductive,\u201d he added. \u201cPolice are not going to be the ones to help cure my community.\u201d</p> <p>Kenyatta Bakeer, a Black Lives Matter member, said Hussle\u2019s work was an inspiration to so many people in South LA \u2013 and that any law enforcement crackdown would not prevent people from following in his footsteps: \u201cWe\u2019re not letting it deter us.\u201d</p>",

Harris-Dawson said he was stunned by police officials\u2019 refusal to share basic information with him: \u201cI\u2019m the councilman, for God\u2019s sake \u2026 It\u2019s suspiciously opaque.\u201d As rival gangs that had long been in conflict began meeting to talk about possible truces and ways to prevent more bloodshed following Hussle\u2019s death, LA authorities reportedly continued their investigations into Hussle and his properties. The case has allegedly involved the city attorney\u2019s office, which is generally responsible for low-level misdemeanor cases and municipal ordinances. Harris-Dawson said that meant the investigation could have been some kind of \u201cnuisance\u201d case, which the city attorney has used in the past to crack down on gang activity. But a nuisance investigation seemed unnecessary and unfair for the Marathon Store, which had grown into a thriving business at Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson Avenue, the councilman said: \u201cAt most, they have a slightly annoying loitering problem that is common with any coffee shop that is successful.\u201d The LAPD spokesman Josh Rubenstein told the Guardian, \u201cWe\u2019re working with the property owners to ensure that the criminal element is not occurring \u2026 [and] to mitigate any criminal issues.\u201d He declined to comment further on the alleged \u201ccriminal\u201d activity, adding, \u201cWe are trying to work with the community in a proactive and positive manner.\u201d Spokespeople for the city attorney\u2019s office and Mayor Eric Garcetti declined to comment. This week\u2019s news was not the first hint of tensions between Hussle\u2019s business and the city. During a eulogy at the rapper\u2019s funeral, Hussle\u2019s brother said the city and police had previously tried to evict them from the strip mall. LaTanya Ward, another activist who coordinated meetings between rival gangs after Hussle\u2019s death, said the investigation was part of a pattern of racist policing in LA. \u201cIt just exposes what the people where we come from already know. We have no faith or hope in the police,\u201d she said, adding that people gathered around the Marathon store, because it was built by people from the area. \u201cOther neighborhoods have social clubs and nice places to go out and eat. We gotta create that shit for ourselves \u2026 They have to hang there, because where else the fuck they gonna hang?\u201d California has a controversial history of arresting and incarcerating people due to their purported gang ties, including widely criticized \u201cgang injunctions\u201d that prohibited certain people from being in the same spaces and were eventually deemed unconstitutional. Investigating Hussle\u2019s store for alleged gang activity felt like an extension of those policies, said Lanaisha Edwards, a South LA community organizer. Edwards, who works on youth gang intervention and lost two brothers to gang violence, said that her relatives in the past had faced arrest simply because they were around other family members and considered part of the same gang under the injunctions. She was not surprised to learn that police had targeted Hussle, but was disturbed to know it was ongoing: \u201cWhat is the point? The man is already dead \u2026 It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to mess with a black entrepreneur from the community, an icon who was all about change?\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening.\u201d She said it felt clear that some city leaders simply did not support Hussle\u2019s investments in the neighborhood. \u201cPeople are trying to change their community \u2026 and it\u2019s never gonna look the way you want it to look,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cYou had a week of no violence because of this man, but you are still going to try to find some way to defame him?\u201d This kind of news made it difficult for community organizers to collaborate with police, said Bernard Cooper, another former gang member who worked on truces between rival groups after Hussle\u2019s death: \u201cThere\u2019s credibility issues in the streets, and it impacts the whole movement. There are people working with police on one side, and then on the flip side, the police are investigating these people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s counterproductive,\u201d he added. \u201cPolice are not going to be the ones to help cure my community.\u201d Kenyatta Bakeer, a Black Lives Matter member, said Hussle\u2019s work was an inspiration to so many people in South LA \u2013 and that any law enforcement crackdown would not prevent people from following in his footsteps: \u201cWe\u2019re not letting it deter us.\u201d",

His name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/neil-armstrong\">Neil Armstrong</a> and his astonishing act of creativity is a photograph of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/apollo-11-moon-landing\">Apollo 11</a> crewmate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/buzz-aldrin\">Buzz Aldrin</a> standing on the Sea of Tranquillity on the moon.

Yet these reflective qualities are part of what makes this such a powerful, complex image, one in which we can see two lunar horizons. Behind Aldrin, the moon\u2019s bright surface recedes to a blue horizon against the black void of space. Meanwhile, reflected and warped by the helmet, the other horizon stretches away behind Armstrong.

It\u2019s as if the moon\u2019s surface has overwhelmed Aldrin\u2019s face, or even become it.</p> <p>The photographs that the pair took during their 21 hours and 36 minutes on Earth\u2019s satellite from 20 to 21 July 1969 are so astonishingly good that their very quality has, perversely, become one of the arguments used by conspiracy theorists who believe the landings were faked. How, they ask, could this have been possible? But, instead of wasting our time on that, we should ask how Apollo 11 added artistic genius to all its other achievements. It was, after all, no casual afterthought that Armstrong was standing there in the airless lunar day with a camera in his heavily gloved hands. This was the dreamlike climax of a love affair between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa\">Nasa</a>\u2019s astronauts and photography \u2013 a passion that altered human consciousness for ever.</p> <p>It all started when John Glenn walked into a store in Cocoa Beach, Florida, at the start of the 1960s. Glenn, one of Nasa\u2019s original team of seven astronauts selected from the test pilot elite, was getting ready for America\u2019s first attempt to put a human in orbit. He wanted to take pictures, but how could he do that while flying Friendship 7, as his craft was called?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52a944f330d9395060ee3fe1f69554dda7538948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a944f330d9395060ee3fe1f69554dda7538948/0_0_2344_1828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldrin poses next to the stars and stripes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldrin poses next to the stars and stripes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then he saw, in the Cocoa Beach shop he had popped into after getting a haircut, a Minolta automatic camera. He bought this new toy, reasoning that automatic focus would save time taking pictures in space. Nasa engineers added a handle to make it easier to hold in his bulky mittens.</p> <p>In fact, the Minolta was loaded with infrared film and used for astronomical images, while Glenn was instead given a Leica to shoot colour photos of Earth way below him. As he completed his historic orbit in February 1962, he took gorgeous images of the blue sphere, its bright expanse dappled with white vapour, standing out amid the blackness. That was a revelation. And it was just the start. In 1962, this was the most remote view of Earth anyone could get: a blue planet, but seen only in part, from close orbit. It took the Apollo programme to show us the true solitary splendour of our life-filled world.</p> <p>\u201cWe choose to go to the moon in this decade,\u201d promised President John F Kennedy a few months after Glenn\u2019s orbit. And on 24 December 1968, Kennedy\u2019s vision bore fruit in an image that permanently changed human consciousness. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon, looking for future landing sites. As it rolled round the dead orb, astronaut William Anders took a photograph of a living one. His picture became known as Earthrise. In the foreground is the dull, lifeless skin of the moon. Beyond it in the blackness hangs our planet, visibly alive even from that distance, a thrilling swirl of land, water and cloud, an oasis of the organic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1a4669da6b722ce8d781898a34f49164be0b8ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1a4669da6b722ce8d781898a34f49164be0b8ee/0_0_2892_3000/964.jpg\" alt=\"Stunned wonder \u2026 Aldrin sets up an experiment into solar wind.\" width=\"964\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stunned wonder \u2026 Aldrin sets up an experiment into solar wind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Armstrong/AP/Press Association</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earthrise has become a defining image of our living world and its fragility. Concepts such as the biosphere (this is literally a picture of a biosphere) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/aug/27/james-lovelock-gaia\">James Lovelock\u2019s Gaia</a> wouldn\u2019t make sense without it, nor the images of Island Earth that followed. In fact, the photograph Anders took answered a deeply felt need in the late 60s. You might imagine that there was a huge gulf between the Apollo programme and all the political and cultural clashes of the time. The astronauts with their air force backgrounds and iron professionalism, the white-shirted ground control staff with their nerdish intensity \u2013 they seem somehow detached from hippies, antiwar protests, Vietnam and drugs.</p> <p>Yet the counterculture was spaced out, too. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?\u201d asked one of its key figures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/stewart-brand\">Stewart Brand</a>, in 1966. He believed Nasa was hiding images of the whole Earth, and that these could give people a new sense of oneness \u2013 as well as disproving flat-earthism, which he regarded as a bummer. Hippies wore badges bearing Brand\u2019s question. In 1968, he put Earthrise on the cover of his alternative-living publication The Whole Earth Catalog. </p> <p>To see our world from space, Brand realised, is a political \u2013 as well as a philosophical \u2013 bombshell. What\u2019s less widely recognised is how much the astronauts shared this understanding. They weren\u2019t passive travellers on their rockets but explorers fully open to the newness of what they saw, and capable of expressing it in a poetry all of their own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eaa031d25158f68c3164606bbde53d25f055ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eaa031d25158f68c3164606bbde53d25f055ef7/0_159_792_475/500.jpg\" alt=\"Pale Blue Dot \u2026 Earth seen from four billion miles by Voyager 1.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pale blue dot \u2026 Earth seen from 4 billion miles away by Voyager 1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOne small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind\u201d \u2013 those were the perfect words for the first human foot being placed on the moon, even if Armstrong did forget to say the \u201ca\u201d. But the astronaut expressed himself even more vividly as a photographer. Most of the Apollo shots showing a human figure are of Aldrin, taken by Armstrong. Aldrin later expressed surprise by this and put it down to the various tasks that preoccupied him, including setting up experiments. There were tensions before the flight about who should step off the lander first: Aldrin believed precedent and military dignity \u2013 he was still a serving air force officer \u2013 meant he rather than the mission commander should go first and said so.</p> <p>Trained to keep their cool, both men surprised ground control with their enthusiasm after touchdown. Armstrong had to land manually, overriding the planned computer landing because the chosen site was too rocky. He did this perfectly with seconds of fuel left. Then, according to the flight plan, the two astronauts were to have a sensible sleep. But they refused. They wanted to go out and play \u2013 and they did.</p> <p>Aldrin expressed the sheer joy of being on the moon by bounding about, exploring what it was like to move in low gravity. Ground staff worried he might fall over and pierce his life support system. Meanwhile, Armstrong, so steady, put his sense of wonder into the photographs he took. The men were equipped with two specially made Hasselblad cameras, as well as a stereoscopic camera for closeups of rocks. But it\u2019s the portraits that are most entrancing. Aldrin looks like an alien. His body hangs loose, moving with almost drugged steps on the grey desert that stretches to nothingness \u2013 to true, black nothingness. In this unearthly place he has become unearthly. Reflected in the helmet, the lander\u2019s leg looks massive and it, too, is an invader. Yet we come in peace. There are no residents to colonise. It\u2019s the most innocent moment in the whole history of human exploration \u2013 a new world with no one in it to rule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9920c3c86786f4f02fa081e75ec5279847c32a76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9920c3c86786f4f02fa081e75ec5279847c32a76/194_297_2319_2898/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sublime \u2026 the Hubble telescope has revealed light-filled dust clouds that are light years across.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sublime \u2026 the Hubble telescope has revealed light-filled dust clouds that are light years across.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aldrin seems to float as much as stand, lost in the thrill of this utter newness. In another picture, he poses next to a white banner-like hanging that he has just set up for an experiment into solar wind. Again, you sense his stunned wonder. Again, the moon\u2019s surface is reflected in his helmet visor, as sunlight glitters on the gold-coloured lander and the pale dusty ground. The biggest mystery in these photographs is the white-suited visitor. Where did this peculiar looking creature with a reflective face and a giant backpack come from \u2013 and why?</p> <p>Armstrong\u2019s photograph of Aldrin saluting the stars and stripes is even more disconcerting. Who is meant to find this US flag? This symbol from another world is faced by an astronaut whose visor is more like an opaque golden shield. Behind it, his mind seems focused on anything but the flag. It\u2019s as if he can\u2019t quite remember what it means.</p> <p>His scientific work seems ritualised and meaningless. It\u2019s the astonishing fact of being on this desolate landscape that we\u2019re drawn to. He is the most complex phenomenon on this entire rock. If Earthrise showed us the uniqueness of our planet in an otherwise lifeless solar system, the Apollo astronauts\u2019 portraits show us the stupendous fact of human consciousness in an otherwise mindless universe. One human photographing another in space is as perfect an image of the mystery of ourselves as you can get.</p> <p>The legacy of Earthrise has never stopped growing \u2013 and the Earth, as seen by unmanned spacecraft, has never stopped shrinking. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/10/nasas-voyager-2-probe-reaches-interstellar-space\">Nasa\u2019s Voyager probe</a> reached the edge of the solar system it turned to take a picture of a tiny Earth alongside its neighbouring planets. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/hubble-space-telescope\">Hubble telescope</a> and its like have shown us a sublime, colourful universe whose light-filled dust clouds are light years across.</p> <p>Yet the photographs taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts and the handful of humans who followed them remain unique. They are still the only portraits of our species on another world. To look at them is to realise why humans need to go there for themselves, to measure themselves against the complete otherness of space, to evolve into spacepeople as Aldrin does right before our eyes in these great utopian treasures of the 1960s.</p>",

There were tensions before the flight about who should step off the lander first: Aldrin believed precedent and military dignity \u2013 he was still a serving air force officer \u2013 meant he rather than the mission commander should go first and said so. Trained to keep their cool, both men surprised ground control with their enthusiasm after touchdown. Armstrong had to land manually, overriding the planned computer landing because the chosen site was too rocky. He did this perfectly with seconds of fuel left. Then, according to the flight plan, the two astronauts were to have a sensible sleep. But they refused. They wanted to go out and play \u2013 and they did. Aldrin expressed the sheer joy of being on the moon by bounding about, exploring what it was like to move in low gravity. Ground staff worried he might fall over and pierce his life support system. Meanwhile, Armstrong, so steady, put his sense of wonder into the photographs he took. The men were equipped with two specially made Hasselblad cameras, as well as a stereoscopic camera for closeups of rocks. But it\u2019s the portraits that are most entrancing. Aldrin looks like an alien. His body hangs loose, moving with almost drugged steps on the grey desert that stretches to nothingness \u2013 to true, black nothingness. In this unearthly place he has become unearthly. Reflected in the helmet, the lander\u2019s leg looks massive and it, too, is an invader. Yet we come in peace. There are no residents to colonise. It\u2019s the most innocent moment in the whole history of human exploration \u2013 a new world with no one in it to rule. Aldrin seems to float as much as stand, lost in the thrill of this utter newness. In another picture, he poses next to a white banner-like hanging that he has just set up for an experiment into solar wind. Again, you sense his stunned wonder. Again, the moon\u2019s surface is reflected in his helmet visor, as sunlight glitters on the gold-coloured lander and the pale dusty ground. The biggest mystery in these photographs is the white-suited visitor. Where did this peculiar looking creature with a reflective face and a giant backpack come from \u2013 and why? Armstrong\u2019s photograph of Aldrin saluting the stars and stripes is even more disconcerting. Who is meant to find this US flag? This symbol from another world is faced by an astronaut whose visor is more like an opaque golden shield. Behind it, his mind seems focused on anything but the flag. It\u2019s as if he can\u2019t quite remember what it means. His scientific work seems ritualised and meaningless. It\u2019s the astonishing fact of being on this desolate landscape that we\u2019re drawn to. He is the most complex phenomenon on this entire rock. If Earthrise showed us the uniqueness of our planet in an otherwise lifeless solar system, the Apollo astronauts\u2019 portraits show us the stupendous fact of human consciousness in an otherwise mindless universe. One human photographing another in space is as perfect an image of the mystery of ourselves as you can get. The legacy of Earthrise has never stopped growing \u2013 and the Earth, as seen by unmanned spacecraft, has never stopped shrinking. When Nasa\u2019s Voyager probe reached the edge of the solar system it turned to take a picture of a tiny Earth alongside its neighbouring planets. The Hubble telescope and its like have shown us a sublime, colourful universe whose light-filled dust clouds are light years across. Yet the photographs taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts and the handful of humans who followed them remain unique. They are still the only portraits of our species on another world. To look at them is to realise why humans need to go there for themselves, to measure themselves against the complete otherness of space, to evolve into spacepeople as Aldrin does right before our eyes in these great utopian treasures of the 1960s.",

In summer, the familiar native flowers of similar hue in this oak wood are ground-hugging, five-pointed stars of yellow pimpernel, Lysimachia nemorum, a characteristic species of ancient woodland. The arrival of its new companion, rising through the brambles and fern fronds, marks the latest advance of a botanical paradox. Welsh poppy is simultaneously a native and an alien wild flower in Britain. As a component of the Arctic-alpine flora, which probably colonised soon after the glaciers retreated, the wild plant was mostly confined to rocky, wooded slopes in Wales, where it seemed reluctant to spread beyond its native habitat. But over the past five decades it has advanced rapidly through much of lowland England, Scotland and Wales, with gardeners acting as intermediaries.

Facebook has been banned in China since 2009. </p> <p>But in contrast to the Facebook accounts \u2013 mostly used to promote Chinese culture and repost official media hailing diplomatic cooperation \u2013 individual Twitter accounts take a more personal tone and are used to counter perceptions of China as heavily restrictive, she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe aim behind this is to make China appear more familiar to foreign audiences, more friendly, more approachable, more directly exposed,\u201d said Cappelletti. \u201cWhen you have an individual speaking. It\u2019s easier to think it is more reliable in terms of not being censored because it is an individual.\u201d</p> <p>The personal Twitter accounts of diplomats appear to be more confrontational, taking on more controversial topics. Another diplomat, Zhang Lizhong, China\u2019s ambassador to the Maldives, recently took aim at the former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed, now the parliament\u2019s speaker.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Nasheed said his country\u2019s debt to China had reached \u201calarming levels\u201d and criticised the cost of Chinese projects, echoing previous accusations of Beijing engaging in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/warning-sounded-over-chinas-debtbook-diplomacy\">debt-trap diplomacy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Zhang, tweeting at Nasheed, wrote: \u201cWhat I cannot accept is continuous unverified and misleading info. to the public, which harms our friendly relations,\u201d adding that having a \u201crational [dialogue] based on correct data\u201d was only a \u201cphonecall away\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AmbassadorZhang/status/1147781718528544768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MohamedNasheed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MohamedNasheed</a> What I cannot accept is continuous unverified and misleading info. to the public, which harms our friendly relations. it is vital to have rational diologue based on correct data. and It is a phonecall away to get full picture for any doubt. <a href=\"https://t.co/ANWLO2JGbQ\">pic.twitter.com/ANWLO2JGbQ</a></p>&mdash; Zhang Lizhong (@AmbassadorZhang) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbassadorZhang/status/1147781718528544768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 7, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, who joined Twitter last week, also used the platform to criticise the visit of Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, to the US. Beijing claims Taiwan, where a rival Chinese government was set up following the end of Chinese civil war in 1949, as still part of the mainland.</p> <p>Cui wrote: \u201cTaiwan is part of China. No attempts to split China will ever succeed \u2026 Those who play with fire only get themselves burned. Period.\u201d</p> <p>Few other Chinese diplomats have set up individual social media accounts but observers expect more to come as officials heed Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s call to \u201ctell China stories well\u201d. Wei Qian, the ambassador to Panama, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weiasecas\">tweets in Spanish</a>, joined in October 2017 while the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/China_Amb_India\">ambassador to India</a> joined in December of the same year.</p> <p>A Twitter user since 2010 and one of China\u2019s most outspoken diplomats on the platform, Zhao is something of a pioneer. <a href=\"https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-02169217/document\">A recent paper</a> in the International Journal of Communication on Chinese public diplomacy through Twitter described Zhao as having \u201cexercised less restraint, discretion, and caution than might typically be expected from Chinese officials who speak in public or post on social media\u201d.</p> <p>Another early trailblazer, Hu Xijin, editor of the state-run Global Times, has had an account on Twitter since 2014. Hu, tweeting in English, often confronts critical media reports on China.</p> <p>While using Twitter opens the possibility for open dialogue, Cappelletti says there is actually very little debate.</p> <p>\u201cThe impression is you can engage in a conversation, but the reality is that there is no conversation. It is [the diplomat] giving a perspective and backing it in a very strong determined way,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While some observers see Zhao\u2019s recent criticised posts as a misfire, Cappelletti sees them as strategic, a way to spotlight Beijing\u2019s positions on issues such as Taiwan or Xinjiang that often come under international scrutiny. Zhao gained about 1,000 more followers after his spat with Rice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s even a victory for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the game they are starting to play ... so it\u2019s something they calculated and are ready to face.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chinese envoys are experimenting with a new kind of Trump-style public diplomacy \u2013 Twitter spats. Twitter is banned in China, but Chinese diplomats abroad, not traditionally known for being outspoken, have started to use the platform to confront Beijing\u2019s critics more directly and aggressively. Earlier this week, Zhao Lijian, deputy chief of mission to Pakistan, joined the fray while defending Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uighurs, a Muslim minority in the far western Chinese territory of Xinjiang. Zhao took aim at the US, a vocal critic of the mass detentions of Uighurs in Xinjiang, by listing a range of social issues in the US including racial segregation. He wrote: \u201cIf you\u2019re in Washington, D.C., you know the white never go to the SW area, because it\u2019s an area for the black &amp; Latin. There\u2019s a saying \u2018black in &amp; white out\u2019.\u201d He went on: \u201cRacism in US has existed since the colonial era. Racial stratification continues to occur in employment, housing, education, lending, &amp; government.\u201d His tweet prompted former national security adviser Susan Rice to call Zhao a \u201cracist disgrace\u201d and said he should be recalled to China. Zhao deleted his original tweet but doubled down on his previous point, going on to describe the \u201cliving conditions of African Americans\u201d as \u201cworrisome\u201d, and highlighting the country\u2019s \u201cendless\u201d school shootings, and women \u201cliving in fear\u201d of sexual assault. \u201cTruth hurts. I am simply telling the truth,\u201d he wrote. Zhao is among a small but increasingly vocal group of Chinese diplomats who are taking their message directly to international audiences via social media. \u201cIt is a new communication strategy adopted by Chinese diplomatic actors,\u201d said Alessandra Cappelletti, a cultural diplomacy expert at Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. \u201cThey are using this tool increasingly in an effective and sophisticated way to reach the broader audience as much as possible,\u201d she said. Since 2014, all Chinese embassies abroad have established official Facebook pages, according to Cappelletti, who recently published a paper analysing digital diplomacy and Zhao\u2019s Twitter account. Facebook has been banned in China since 2009. But in contrast to the Facebook accounts \u2013 mostly used to promote Chinese culture and repost official media hailing diplomatic cooperation \u2013 individual Twitter accounts take a more personal tone and are used to counter perceptions of China as heavily restrictive, she said. \u201cThe aim behind this is to make China appear more familiar to foreign audiences, more friendly, more approachable, more directly exposed,\u201d said Cappelletti. \u201cWhen you have an individual speaking. It\u2019s easier to think it is more reliable in terms of not being censored because it is an individual.\u201d The personal Twitter accounts of diplomats appear to be more confrontational, taking on more controversial topics. Another diplomat, Zhang Lizhong, China\u2019s ambassador to the Maldives, recently took aim at the former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed, now the parliament\u2019s speaker. Earlier this month, Nasheed said his country\u2019s debt to China had reached \u201calarming levels\u201d and criticised the cost of Chinese projects, echoing previous accusations of Beijing engaging in \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy\u201d. Zhang, tweeting at Nasheed, wrote: \u201cWhat I cannot accept is continuous unverified and misleading info. to the public, which harms our friendly relations,\u201d adding that having a \u201crational [dialogue] based on correct data\u201d was only a \u201cphonecall away\u201d. The Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, who joined Twitter last week, also used the platform to criticise the visit of Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, to the US. Beijing claims Taiwan, where a rival Chinese government was set up following the end of Chinese civil war in 1949, as still part of the mainland. Cui wrote: \u201cTaiwan is part of China. No attempts to split China will ever succeed \u2026 Those who play with fire only get themselves burned. Period.\u201d Few other Chinese diplomats have set up individual social media accounts but observers expect more to come as officials heed Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s call to \u201ctell China stories well\u201d. Wei Qian, the ambassador to Panama, who tweets in Spanish, joined in October 2017 while the ambassador to India joined in December of the same year. A Twitter user since 2010 and one of China\u2019s most outspoken diplomats on the platform, Zhao is something of a pioneer. A recent paper in the International Journal of Communication on Chinese public diplomacy through Twitter described Zhao as having \u201cexercised less restraint, discretion, and caution than might typically be expected from Chinese officials who speak in public or post on social media\u201d. Another early trailblazer, Hu Xijin, editor of the state-run Global Times, has had an account on Twitter since 2014. Hu, tweeting in English, often confronts critical media reports on China. While using Twitter opens the possibility for open dialogue, Cappelletti says there is actually very little debate. \u201cThe impression is you can engage in a conversation, but the reality is that there is no conversation. It is [the diplomat] giving a perspective and backing it in a very strong determined way,\u201d she said. While some observers see Zhao\u2019s recent criticised posts as a misfire, Cappelletti sees them as strategic, a way to spotlight Beijing\u2019s positions on issues such as Taiwan or Xinjiang that often come under international scrutiny. Zhao gained about 1,000 more followers after his spat with Rice. \u201cIt\u2019s even a victory for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the game they are starting to play ... so it\u2019s something they calculated and are ready to face.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A 15-month-old child held in immigration detention in Australia since birth despite the protests of the United Nations has been hospitalised, advocates say. Isabella Lee Pin Loong was transported to the Northern hospital, Epping, on Friday suffering what her mother\u2019s lawyer, Alison Battisson, described as a \u201cchronic fever\u201d. On Tuesday the hospital confirmed that Isabella, who has been held at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation centre since her birth, was being \u201ctreated for a medical condition as an inpatient\u201d. Ambulance Victoria said it would not comment on people transported to hospital from the immigration centre \u2013 despite doing so in previous cases. Battisson told Guardian Australia that there have been concerns about the child\u2019s welfare for more than a month, and that on Friday evening she was hospitalised with a fever. \u201cIsabella has spent her entire 15-month life in detention and throughout that time we have raised a number of concerns about the appropriateness of detention for raising a child,\u201d Battisson, the director of the advocate group Human Rights For All, said. In a statement on Wednesday, Australian Border Force confirmed an infant was being treated at the Northern hospital for influenza but denied the child was \u201cdetained\u201d in the immigration facility. \u201cHer mother is detained and her father lives in the community,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe infant has been living with her mother at her request, but may come and go from the facility and stay in the community with her family.\u201d \u201cA range of care, welfare and support arrangements are in place to provide for the needs of children and young people in detention.\u201d The United Nations has previously called for both Isabella and her Vietnamese mother to be released by the Australian government, saying their detention contravened a number of articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In June the UN working group on arbitrary detention, which noted Isabella had previously been hospitalised, said her detention and that of her mother, Huyen Thu Thi Tran, was arbitrary and they should be released and receive compensation. \u201cTaking into account all the circumstances of the case, the appropriate remedy would be to release Huyen Thu Thi Tran and Isabella Lee Pin Loong immediately and to accord them an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,\u201d it said. The working group rejected the government\u2019s assertion that Isabella was not detained, saying Tran had little choice if she wanted to \u201csee her newborn baby and look after her\u201d. Battisson said Isabella had been suffering from ongoing fevers for about six weeks, and that she had previously called ambulances to the detention centre to ensure she was receiving proper care. \u201cOur concerns have been about Isabella\u2019s wellbeing, the appropriateness of medications in the centre and her mother\u2019s inability to maintain appropriate sanitation and well-being there,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Tran arrived at Christmas Island by boat in 2011 after fleeing religious persecution. She was initially detained for 17 months and placed in community detention, from which she absconded. After being taken into detention in November 2017, the UN report noted, her \u201cmental and physical health have deteriorated\u201d and Isabella experienced a number of health issues. It found Isabella \u201cexhibits signs of attachment related anxiety and is at risk of developmental problems due to her mother\u2019s depression and her prolonged detention\u201d. \u201cThe lack of positive emotional interactions in detention is also likely to have an ongoing negative impact on the infant\u2019s development,\u201d the report noted. It also wrote that Isabella \u201chas reportedly also experienced illness in detention and been hospitalised\u201d. It comes after a spate of incidents at the Melbourne immigration centre. At about midnight on Friday \u2013 the same day Isabella was transported to hospital \u2013 a 23-year-old Afghan man died at the centre. This week police said his death was not being treated as suspicious but authorities have not provided any other detail about the cause of death. In the early hours of Monday morning, another 23-year-old Afghan man was hospitalised after he attempted to set himself on fire inside the centre. The ABF said the infant was first hospitalised on 11 July but released without treatment, and was visited in the detention facility by a child wellbeing officer the next day. \u201cOn 14 July medical professionals at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation (MITA)\u2014adjacent to the Broadmeadows residential precinct\u2014again assessed her condition and referred her to the Northern hospital,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn the best interests of the infant, the department ensured that her mother was able to accompany her to hospital and she remains with her.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stargazers around the world have enjoyed a view of a global lunar eclipse, delighting people from Dehli to Dublin. The partial eclipse was visible in nearly every part of the world except for North America and the polar climes of Greenland and northern Russia. In Australia and Asia, the eclipse was visible in the early hours of Wednesday morning and, in Europe, it was visible on Tuesday evening as the sun went down. In Sydney a local cameraman captured the eclipse as it hung above Sydney Harbour at dawn. In Delhi, the eclipse began just after midnight. And across Europe and the UK, the stunning sight appeared in the summer sky. Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, which casts a shadow across the moon, making parts of it appear to disappear. In the UK, the Earth\u2019s outer shadow or penumbra, crossed the moon at 19.45 BST on Tuesday, the mid-eclipse occurred at 22.32 BST, and the eclipse finished at 01.15 BST on Wednesday.",

Set across time (1791 to 1940) and space (but mostly Paris), it consists of three texts that can be read in two ways: separately or jumbled up together. It\u2019s about migration, identity, memory, multiplicity and appropriation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/11/tara-june-winch-the-yield-andrew-bolt-unmissables\">\u2018I had to be manic\u2019: Tara June Winch on her unmissable new novel \u2013 and surviving Andrew Bolt</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>It took me almost seven years to write Crossings and involved research in libraries in several countries. It\u2019s a book about influence, influenced by a small library\u2019s worth of other books \u2013 like Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Hopscotch and Virginia Woolf\u2019s Orlando \u2013 many of which I read decades before writing Crossings. When I first had the idea for the novel, I was reading a lot of Roberto Bola\u00f1o, who taught me the power of inverting \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d, and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, who taught me the power of paradox \u2013 Crossings is dialectical in that it can\u2019t be apprehended as a whole, even if you read every word.</p> <p>If I had to nominate a single inspiration, it would be a beguilingly Delphic essay written by Walter Benjamin, one of the novel\u2019s three narrators, shortly before his death, which is recounted in the novel. Crossings is, among other things, a playfully allegorical fantasy inspired by On the Concept of History.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Writing Crossings was so intense, I was mostly unable to read beyond the scope of researching the novel, so I\u2019m now in catch-up mode. I\u2019m very much looking forward to reading Bruce Pascoe\u2019s Dark Emu, as it is long past high time our collective dismissal of Australian Indigenous cultures and their achievements was redressed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ranjana Srivastava<br></strong><em><strong>A Better Death</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Simon &amp; Schuster</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ffc9f2c9b8f90b4f7be1917904534b857ba6608f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffc9f2c9b8f90b4f7be1917904534b857ba6608f/0_0_1400_2134/656.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for A Better Death by Ranjana Srivastava\" width=\"656\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>A Better Death is about the companion bookend to being born that is our death. I wrote it after years of observing how my most remarkable patients deal with a terminal illness and it turns out that often they have met some of the preconditions by living well. I am struck by the way some people fit in kindness, gratitude, equanimity and an acceptance of their mortality into their lives and I think they have something to teach us all. My book combines stories and practical advice on dying well and I hope it will help people contemplate their life and think about what really matters.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>I am always reading widely but I picked up the 3,000-year-old Hindu text, the Mahabharata, and was moved by one sentence. \u201cDay after day man sees countless people die, but still he acts and thinks as if he will live forever.\u201d It\u2019s the reason I wrote A Better Death.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>I am unfashionably late, I know, but I am going to read The Slap by Christos Tsiolkas.

And yes, lots of praying. One ABC radio interviewer said it reminded her of Murder on the Orient Express. Spoiler alert here: everyone was responsible, including Scott Morrison, Peter Dutton, Mathias Cormann and ultimately Malcolm Turnbull.</p> <p>Some people have told me they found it painful to read, others love all the gory details. After Turnbull was deposed, even though I had been following events for my column in The Australian, I wanted to know more about why it happened. I figured \u2013 or rather hoped \u2013 that if I wanted to know more, so would other political tragics. It\u2019s a big deal when prime ministers are deposed and we deserve to know as much as possible about those responsible and what drove them to do it.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it?</strong> Plots and Prayers has taken over my life. I began work on the book the day after Turnbull lost the prime ministership on 24 August 2018 and have been immersed in it (or obsessed by it) ever since, so have not had time to read anything else. It was originally called Highway to Hell (you will see why if you read the Prologue) and there were times I felt I had been there and back.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next?</strong> Boy Swallows Universe by Trent Dalton.

In the book I look at everything from concepts of animal suffering, to environmental impact (including some big furphies that don\u2019t really relate to Australia), as well as considering the most important animal: the human one. It\u2019s my attempt to intellectualise the debate around eating animals, to move it away from the radicalised, shouty ends of the spectrum. I try to demystify what\u2019s involved in rearing animals for meat, and the ethics around food production generally, for the thinking eater.</p> <p>What I want is for all of us, regardless of whether we\u2019re vegetarian, vegan or omnivore, to become more aware of the effect of our eating on animals, farmers and the environment that provides food for us. The ultimate aim is to have us all feel more conscious, more powerful, but also less anxious about our food choices. </p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Call of the Reed Warbler by Charles Massy. Charles\u2019 book was full of how bad farming, of any kind, can ruin the land, but finishes full of hope for the future of food production and the land that provides it.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Bruny by Heather Rose, due out in October. The early reviews of the new book by the author of the cracking Museum of Modern Love sound terrific, and it\u2019s set in places I feel a great affinity to in Tasmania.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Andrew Stafford <br></strong><em><strong>Something to Believe In </strong></em><strong><br><sub>UQP</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4726eab0da8402040459b1caeb96b7b3157c6c9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4726eab0da8402040459b1caeb96b7b3157c6c9d/0_0_1796_2680/670.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for Something to Believe In by Andrew Stafford\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>Something to Believe In is a music memoir by a self-confessed wannabe \u2013 someone who wanted to be on stage but didn\u2019t have the chops, talent or nerve to get up and do it himself, and fell into writing about it instead. I\u2019ve got a song for every occasion, so it\u2019s pretty much a life story told through some of those favourite songs, and on that level, it\u2019s whimsical and self-deprecating.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also quite dark \u2013 it wrestles with mental health, masculinity, mortality, and falling in and out of love, including marriage and divorce. It all provided good scaffolding to talk about the healing power of music, which is the real theme. I tried to make it like a lot of my favourite music and music writing, as intimate and emotionally direct as possible; I had a mantra of radical transparency when I was writing it. It\u2019s sad and sweet and funny and true.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Nothing, once it got hold of me \u2013 I wrote it in two months (followed by nine months of editing), which didn\u2019t leave much room for further reading. But I did read Tim Rogers\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/20/tim-rogers-on-his-painfully-honest-memoir-i-needed-to-cut-the-sympathy-right-out\">Detours</a> beforehand, another rock memoir, and was inspired by its vulnerability and tenderness.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Rereading Andrew McGahan\u2019s Praise.

He\u2019s had a hard life and trusts only his dogs; the very land makes him uneasy because he can\u2019t read it, as he did in England. But then he and a fellow shepherd, Rowdy Cavanagh, come under attack from a vicious killer named Dan Carver, and Tom soon realises two things: that his life depends on understanding this new country and that sometimes the prey can become the hunter.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it?</strong> I wanted Shepherd to have a spare, lean style, so while I was writing it I reread a lot of pared-back books like Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Olive Kitteridge and Kate Jennings\u2019 Moral Hazard, neither of which wastes a single word.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next?</strong> The next Australian book I\u2019ll read will be something of Liane Moriarty\u2019s.

It tells the story of Odette Brown, an Aboriginal grandmother who is the carer for her 13-year-old granddaughter, Sissy. Their lives are governed by \u201cthe act\u201d, which restricts their freedom of movement and puts Sissy under threat of being removed from her grandmother. When a new, officious policeman arrives in town, Sergeant Lowe, Odette quickly realises that his intentions for Sissy place her in immediate danger. The girl is also being pursued by a local white youth, Aaron Kane, an increasingly malevolent figure roaming the back-blocks of the district in a pick-up truck. Odette decides that she has no choice but to escape the town with Sissy. She does, meeting wonderfully supportive people along the way, while being hunted by those who would do her and Sissy harm.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>During the writing of The White Girl I returned again and again to two short story collections that have greatly influenced my writing; Alistair Macleod\u2019s Island: the collected stories, and Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s A Good Man Is Hard to Find. Macleod\u2019s understanding of place as central to the stories performed within in it is the key to his short fiction, while O\u2019Connor reminds us that some people are \u201cplain bad\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>I have both hands wrapped around Tara June Winch\u2019s new novel, The Yield. I have followed her career closely since she published her debut work, Swallow The Air, in 2006. She is a writer with a remarkable capacity for language. Her ability to put four or five words together and create a most profound poetic image is unique. I will be curling up on the couch with The Yield and will not move until I\u2019ve turned the last page.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Alice Bishop<br></strong><em><strong>A Constant Hum</strong></em><strong><br><sub>Text</sub></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60c261d3c13547a63732b7a12a662eb78590ee9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c261d3c13547a63732b7a12a662eb78590ee9d/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Cover image for A Constant Hum by Alice Bishop\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Tell us about your book. </strong>A Constant Hum is a collection of short fiction about how people cope \u2013 and sometimes don\u2019t \u2013 during the aftermath of bushfire. The firestorms of Black Saturday link all the stories in the book but it also documents the quiet hope of landscape regeneration too.

Most of the characters in the book are based on people I know, or have met \u2013 sometimes in a roundabout way. The quiet, and often under-celebrated, strength of women (both during and after bushfire) is something I was really driven to highlight.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>It took seven years to write A Constant Hum so I read heaps of short story collections over that time. Vintage Cisneros by Sandra Cisneros and A Manual for Cleaning Women by Lucia Berlin are two books I learned a lot from in terms of writing stronger female voices and place. I also often circled back to the Black Saturday Royal Commission Final Report \u2013 mainly to bring back the sensory memory of returning to the ash of our house. Those feelings are threaded through A Constant Hum.</p> <p><strong>What will you read next? </strong>Josephine Rowe\u2019s collection Here Until August (out via Black Inc in September).

It isn\u2019t like anywhere any of them have been before.

Daniel has the sense that they are part of some kind of experiment but he doesn\u2019t know what it is about or what is going to happen to him.</p> <p>The Subjects is a work of speculative fiction that explores how as a society we deal with bad behaviour \u2013 criminalising and medicalising and medicating \u2013 and where we might be headed if we stay fixed on our current course. Ultimately though, I am most interested in what we could do if we got it right.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes.

When each of the children\u2019s families reported their loved ones missing, they say the police told them \u201cmaybe they went walkabout\u201d. That word is heavy with the misunderstanding, disregard and prejudice that fatally weighed down the police response.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a story of courage and determination. The children\u2019s families have spent a generation demanding justice over the killings while, among the police, one detective has spent over 20 years fighting to get the case back into court. People ask me if this country should be ashamed of what happened in Bowraville. I tell them yes, but there is so much to be proud of too.</p> <p><strong>What were you reading while you wrote it? </strong>Homicide by David Simon.

      "bodyText": "Alex Landragin Crossings Picador Tell us about your book. Crossings is a speculative historical novel about two lovers with the ability to transmigrate from one body to another by locking eyes with someone. Set across time (1791 to 1940) and space (but mostly Paris), it consists of three texts that can be read in two ways: separately or jumbled up together. It\u2019s about migration, identity, memory, multiplicity and appropriation. What were you reading while you wrote it? It took me almost seven years to write Crossings and involved research in libraries in several countries. It\u2019s a book about influence, influenced by a small library\u2019s worth of other books \u2013 like Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Hopscotch and Virginia Woolf\u2019s Orlando \u2013 many of which I read decades before writing Crossings. When I first had the idea for the novel, I was reading a lot of Roberto Bola\u00f1o, who taught me the power of inverting \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d, and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, who taught me the power of paradox \u2013 Crossings is dialectical in that it can\u2019t be apprehended as a whole, even if you read every word. If I had to nominate a single inspiration, it would be a beguilingly Delphic essay written by Walter Benjamin, one of the novel\u2019s three narrators, shortly before his death, which is recounted in the novel. Crossings is, among other things, a playfully allegorical fantasy inspired by On the Concept of History. What will you read next? Writing Crossings was so intense, I was mostly unable to read beyond the scope of researching the novel, so I\u2019m now in catch-up mode. I\u2019m very much looking forward to reading Bruce Pascoe\u2019s Dark Emu, as it is long past high time our collective dismissal of Australian Indigenous cultures and their achievements was redressed. Ranjana Srivastava A Better Death Simon &amp; Schuster Tell us about your book. A Better Death is about the companion bookend to being born that is our death. I wrote it after years of observing how my most remarkable patients deal with a terminal illness and it turns out that often they have met some of the preconditions by living well. I am struck by the way some people fit in kindness, gratitude, equanimity and an acceptance of their mortality into their lives and I think they have something to teach us all. My book combines stories and practical advice on dying well and I hope it will help people contemplate their life and think about what really matters. What were you reading while you wrote it? I am always reading widely but I picked up the 3,000-year-old Hindu text, the Mahabharata, and was moved by one sentence. \u201cDay after day man sees countless people die, but still he acts and thinks as if he will live forever.\u201d It\u2019s the reason I wrote A Better Death. What will you read next? I am unfashionably late, I know, but I am going to read The Slap by Christos Tsiolkas. As a mother, I am intrigued by the reverberations of a child being slapped by a stranger at a suburban barbecue. Niki Savva Plots and Prayers Scribe Tell us about your book. It\u2019s a political whodunnit, full of betrayals, plots, sabotage and intrigue involving many highly ambitious, vengeful and bloodthirsty characters. And yes, lots of praying. One ABC radio interviewer said it reminded her of Murder on the Orient Express. Spoiler alert here: everyone was responsible, including Scott Morrison, Peter Dutton, Mathias Cormann and ultimately Malcolm Turnbull. Some people have told me they found it painful to read, others love all the gory details. After Turnbull was deposed, even though I had been following events for my column in The Australian, I wanted to know more about why it happened. I figured \u2013 or rather hoped \u2013 that if I wanted to know more, so would other political tragics. It\u2019s a big deal when prime ministers are deposed and we deserve to know as much as possible about those responsible and what drove them to do it. What were you reading while you wrote it? Plots and Prayers has taken over my life. I began work on the book the day after Turnbull lost the prime ministership on 24 August 2018 and have been immersed in it (or obsessed by it) ever since, so have not had time to read anything else. It was originally called Highway to Hell (you will see why if you read the Prologue) and there were times I felt I had been there and back. What will you read next? Boy Swallows Universe by Trent Dalton. Dalton is a wonderful writer. I can\u2019t wait to read it. Matthew Evans On Eating Meat Murdoch Tell us about your book. On Eating Meat is my attempt to help understand my own and our nation\u2019s conflict over eating animals and how that looks in the real world, not in people\u2019s heads. In the book I look at everything from concepts of animal suffering, to environmental impact (including some big furphies that don\u2019t really relate to Australia), as well as considering the most important animal: the human one. It\u2019s my attempt to intellectualise the debate around eating animals, to move it away from the radicalised, shouty ends of the spectrum. I try to demystify what\u2019s involved in rearing animals for meat, and the ethics around food production generally, for the thinking eater. What I want is for all of us, regardless of whether we\u2019re vegetarian, vegan or omnivore, to become more aware of the effect of our eating on animals, farmers and the environment that provides food for us. The ultimate aim is to have us all feel more conscious, more powerful, but also less anxious about our food choices. What were you reading while you wrote it? Call of the Reed Warbler by Charles Massy. Charles\u2019 book was full of how bad farming, of any kind, can ruin the land, but finishes full of hope for the future of food production and the land that provides it. What will you read next? Bruny by Heather Rose, due out in October. The early reviews of the new book by the author of the cracking Museum of Modern Love sound terrific, and it\u2019s set in places I feel a great affinity to in Tasmania. Andrew Stafford Something to Believe In UQP Tell us about your book. Something to Believe In is a music memoir by a self-confessed wannabe \u2013 someone who wanted to be on stage but didn\u2019t have the chops, talent or nerve to get up and do it himself, and fell into writing about it instead. I\u2019ve got a song for every occasion, so it\u2019s pretty much a life story told through some of those favourite songs, and on that level, it\u2019s whimsical and self-deprecating. But it\u2019s also quite dark \u2013 it wrestles with mental health, masculinity, mortality, and falling in and out of love, including marriage and divorce. It all provided good scaffolding to talk about the healing power of music, which is the real theme. I tried to make it like a lot of my favourite music and music writing, as intimate and emotionally direct as possible; I had a mantra of radical transparency when I was writing it. It\u2019s sad and sweet and funny and true. What were you reading while you wrote it? Nothing, once it got hold of me \u2013 I wrote it in two months (followed by nine months of editing), which didn\u2019t leave much room for further reading. But I did read Tim Rogers\u2019 Detours beforehand, another rock memoir, and was inspired by its vulnerability and tenderness. What will you read next? Rereading Andrew McGahan\u2019s Praise. I\u2019ll be reading an excerpt from it at a tribute in Brisbane on 2 September to celebrate the posthumous release of his final novel, The Rich Man\u2019s House. His loss in February has been keenly felt in Brisbane\u2019s creative community. Catherine Jinks Shepherd Text Tell us about your book. Tom Clay is a 14-year-old convict poacher assigned to a shepherd\u2019s hut in the wilds of New South Wales. He\u2019s had a hard life and trusts only his dogs; the very land makes him uneasy because he can\u2019t read it, as he did in England. But then he and a fellow shepherd, Rowdy Cavanagh, come under attack from a vicious killer named Dan Carver, and Tom soon realises two things: that his life depends on understanding this new country and that sometimes the prey can become the hunter. What were you reading while you wrote it? I wanted Shepherd to have a spare, lean style, so while I was writing it I reread a lot of pared-back books like Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Olive Kitteridge and Kate Jennings\u2019 Moral Hazard, neither of which wastes a single word. What will you read next? The next Australian book I\u2019ll read will be something of Liane Moriarty\u2019s. Truly Madly Guilty, perhaps? I\u2019m ashamed to say that I caught up with her only recently and am now devouring her backlist; she does what she does so very, very well. Tony Birch The White Girl UQP Tell us about your book. The White Girl is a novel set in a fictional Australian town, Deane, in 1963. It tells the story of Odette Brown, an Aboriginal grandmother who is the carer for her 13-year-old granddaughter, Sissy. Their lives are governed by \u201cthe act\u201d, which restricts their freedom of movement and puts Sissy under threat of being removed from her grandmother. When a new, officious policeman arrives in town, Sergeant Lowe, Odette quickly realises that his intentions for Sissy place her in immediate danger. The girl is also being pursued by a local white youth, Aaron Kane, an increasingly malevolent figure roaming the back-blocks of the district in a pick-up truck. Odette decides that she has no choice but to escape the town with Sissy. She does, meeting wonderfully supportive people along the way, while being hunted by those who would do her and Sissy harm. What were you reading while you wrote it? During the writing of The White Girl I returned again and again to two short story collections that have greatly influenced my writing; Alistair Macleod\u2019s Island: the collected stories, and Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s A Good Man Is Hard to Find. Macleod\u2019s understanding of place as central to the stories performed within in it is the key to his short fiction, while O\u2019Connor reminds us that some people are \u201cplain bad\u201d. What will you read next? I have both hands wrapped around Tara June Winch\u2019s new novel, The Yield. I have followed her career closely since she published her debut work, Swallow The Air, in 2006. She is a writer with a remarkable capacity for language. Her ability to put four or five words together and create a most profound poetic image is unique. I will be curling up on the couch with The Yield and will not move until I\u2019ve turned the last page. Alice Bishop A Constant Hum Text Tell us about your book. A Constant Hum is a collection of short fiction about how people cope \u2013 and sometimes don\u2019t \u2013 during the aftermath of bushfire. The firestorms of Black Saturday link all the stories in the book but it also documents the quiet hope of landscape regeneration too. I was so happy to watch the colours and the birds coming back to my hometown, Christmas Hills, after a big part of it was reduced to ash. Community stories about the more lingering hardships of climate-flared natural disaster are a real focus of A Constant Hum. Most of the characters in the book are based on people I know, or have met \u2013 sometimes in a roundabout way. The quiet, and often under-celebrated, strength of women (both during and after bushfire) is something I was really driven to highlight. What were you reading while you wrote it? It took seven years to write A Constant Hum so I read heaps of short story collections over that time. Vintage Cisneros by Sandra Cisneros and A Manual for Cleaning Women by Lucia Berlin are two books I learned a lot from in terms of writing stronger female voices and place. I also often circled back to the Black Saturday Royal Commission Final Report \u2013 mainly to bring back the sensory memory of returning to the ash of our house. Those feelings are threaded through A Constant Hum. What will you read next? Josephine Rowe\u2019s collection Here Until August (out via Black Inc in September). Rowe\u2019s writing is always laced with such a bolstering gold and a grit. Tarcutta Wake is one of the greatest Australian collections of short fiction, I think. I return to it \u2013 and always learn something new \u2013 over and over again. Sarah Hopkins The Subjects Text Tell us about your book. The Subjects is about 16-year-old Daniel who gets caught dealing prescription drugs in high school. Rather than being sent to a juvenile prison he is transported to a mysterious outback facility where he meets a group of other \u201cgifted delinquents\u201d. It isn\u2019t like anywhere any of them have been before. There are sessions with a doctor but no medication, classes with headsets and tablets but no syllabus, and field trips without any apparent purpose. Daniel has the sense that they are part of some kind of experiment but he doesn\u2019t know what it is about or what is going to happen to him. The Subjects is a work of speculative fiction that explores how as a society we deal with bad behaviour \u2013 criminalising and medicalising and medicating \u2013 and where we might be headed if we stay fixed on our current course. Ultimately though, I am most interested in what we could do if we got it right. What were you reading while you wrote it? The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes. The story of a man piecing his past together like a jigsaw, it was a book that got under my skin the way the best books do \u2013 and reminded me of the power of a good reveal. What will you read next? The Tall Man by Chloe Hooper. I don\u2019t read enough non-fiction, and this one has been the top of my list for too long. It is a story of such complexity and significance \u2013 and here tackled by so talented a writer. Mungo MacCallum The Good, the Bad and the Unlikely: Australia\u2019s Prime Ministers Black Inc Tell us about your book. Good drinkers, bad swimmers and unlikely heroes. Whatever the length of their term, each Australian prime minister has a story worth sharing. The Good, the Bad and the Unlikely tells the tale of the many men and one woman who\u2019ve had a crack at running the country. What were you reading while you wrote it? The idea of a chatty, sometimes critical approach was pushed by the more academic line on the prime ministers taken by Colin Hughes (Oxford) and the anthology from Michelle Grattan (New Holland) \u2013 I thought there was more to say about the personalities, successes and failures. I wanted to make them more human, if you like. And the idea of continuous, updated editions \u2013 of history as a living process \u2013 appealed to me especially as journalist. What will you read next? Bruce Pascoe\u2019s Dark Emu and Stan Grant\u2019s latest \u2013 I haven\u2019t even caught up with David Marr. The book I\u2019m desperate to see is the true history of Indigenous Australia culminating in recognition, reconciliation and treaty \u2013 Voice, Treaty, Truth as the Uluru Statement from the Heart puts it \u2013 but I fear I will be waiting a long time. Dan Box Bowraville Viking Tell us about your book. Bowraville is about the murder of three children in a small country town, how the serial killer responsible for what happened is still walking free today, and about what happened to me as I reported on the story, becoming far closer to those involved than I had ever planned. At its heart, this is a story about racism; the three children were all Aboriginal and the man suspected \u2013 and later found not guilty \u2013 was white. When each of the children\u2019s families reported their loved ones missing, they say the police told them \u201cmaybe they went walkabout\u201d. That word is heavy with the misunderstanding, disregard and prejudice that fatally weighed down the police response. It\u2019s also a story of courage and determination. The children\u2019s families have spent a generation demanding justice over the killings while, among the police, one detective has spent over 20 years fighting to get the case back into court. People ask me if this country should be ashamed of what happened in Bowraville. I tell them yes, but there is so much to be proud of too. What were you reading while you wrote it? Homicide by David Simon. The most darkly rich and truly honest account of working murders, including both the detectives and the victims, I have ever read. What will you read next? See What You Made Me Do by Jess Hill. Domestic violence causes more harm to more people than terrorism, yet too many of us do too little in response \u2013 including me. Jess has had the courage to face up to what we won\u2019t. I\u2019ve also heard it\u2019s simply a great read.",

The entitlement is offered to individuals who own shares in a company in recognition of the tax on profits paid by that company. It is attached to a dividend which the company pays to shareholders out of its after-tax profits. The value of the franking credit is equivalent to the tax paid on the individual\u2019s share of the company profit before it was distributed as a dividend.</p>\n    <p>The rationale for the credit is to avoid double taxation.

But he said he was told superannuation rules prevented it from shutting the fund \u2013 and therefore stopping him from getting the cash rebates. \u201cThey said to me we were going to get a $500,000 refund,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cI was so horrified.\u201d Smith\u2019s call for reform comes as Labor considers the future of its contentious election policy to abolish cash rebates for people with excess franking credits. The Coalition labelled the policy a \u201cretiree tax\u201d, a claim strongly disputed by experts, while the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has conceded it was a drag on the party\u2019s campaign. Smith first revealed the windfall to the Sydney Morning Herald, telling the paper the scheme should be means-tested and that it was \u201coutrageous\u201d the wealthy were \u201cgetting money from the government\u201d. He said his accountants had told him to set up the super fund, but he demanded they wind it up after he learned of the impending $500,000 windfall in 2016-17. In November 2017 he wrote to the tax office commissioner, Chris Jordan, asking for the agency to intervene after his accountants said they could not close the fund. Jordan thanked the entrepreneur for his \u201cunusual request\u201d, saying he had never had someone ask him \u201cto pay more tax\u201d. But the tax office later wrote back to Smith telling him rules around market-linked pensions prevented the agency from winding up his super fund. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cAs the regulator of self-managed superannuation funds I am compelled to administer the superannuation rules as stated and I am unable to intervene further in the circumstances you have outlined,\u201d the deputy commissioner of superannuation, James O\u2019Halloran, wrote. Smith said he went on to receive $250,000 in franking credit cash rebates in 2017-18. He told Guardian Australia the fund remained open but claimed his accountants had structured his tax affairs so he paid at least $1m in tax and $1m to charity each year. He suggested Labor had failed to sell its franking credits policy and should have introduced a threshold so that any changes only impacted the wealthy and not the \u201cless well off\u201d. Smith alluded to the issue last year when he told a Dark and Dangerous Thoughts event held by Hobart\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art that it was unfair he was able to save $500,000 a year via his super fund. Pensioners were already exempted from the Labor policy, which would have eventually saved the budget about $8bn a year. An Australian Council of Social Service briefing paper says a person or self-managed super fund losing $10,000 a year in refunded imputation credits would hold around $500,000 in shares (50 times the value of foregone franking credits). Under dividend imputation, shareholders receive franking credits on the company tax paid on share dividends which can then be used to reduce a person\u2019s tax. Howard government changes extended the scheme to allow people to receive cash rebates. Albanese has already hinted that Labor\u2019s franking credits policy might have been improved if it was capped or grandfathered. The second option would slash the revenue the reform might raise, which Labor had banked to amass an election-spending war chest.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary to end the day: Lawmakers passed a resolution condemning Donald Trump\u2019s racist tweets telling congresswomen of color to \u201cgo home\u201d to their countries. The motion passed after a debate, and vote, over whether speaker Nancy Pelosi violated decorum in calling Trump\u2019s racist comments racist. Republicans mostly defended Trump against charges of racism. Senate leader Mitch McConnell said, \u201cThe president\u2019s not a racist\u201d and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of a cynical political ploy. Aide Kellyanne Conway demanded to know the ethnic identity of a reporter who questioned where it was that Trump wished the congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to. Watch the video here. The senate armed services committee held a confirmation hearing on defense secretary nominee Mark Esper. Elsewhere on the Hill, executives from big tech were called to hearings on privacy and censorship. Two lawsuits challenging Trump\u2019s new asylum restrictions were filed today -- one by immigrant advocacy groups in DC federal court and another by the ACLU, in California. The House antitrust committee questioned representatives from Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon in a hearing focused on and anti-competitive behavior in online marketplaces. Trump campaign tapped the president\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump to spearhead a Women for Trump initiative. Reporting on the House resolution that just passed, Sabrina Siddiqui writes: The measure, which formally rebuked the president\u2019s comments as \u201cracist\u201d, was approved on a mostly partisan-line vote of 240 to 187. The vote came days after Trump\u2019s tweets about four newly elected Democratic lawmakers \u2013 Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2013 sparked a widespread uproar. Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib were all born in the US, while Omar is a naturalized American citizen who arrived in the country at a young age as a Somali refugee. \u201cEvery single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president\u2019s racist tweets,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on the House floor. \u201cTo do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.\u201d Here\u2019s a video of the debate, as it happened: Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris of California says she has also been told, \u201cGo back to where you came from.\u201d And several other lawmakers have had the same racist trope lobbed at them. HuffPo asked dozens of lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, whether they\u2019ve ever been told to \u201cgo back.\u201d Nearly every minority lawmaker said yes. Every white lawmaker said no. \u201cI\u2019ve been told many times to \u2018go back to China,\u2019 even though I\u2019m of Japanese descent, because people are prone to stereotypes,\u201d Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) said. \u201cAsian Americans, among other minority groups, often experience the feeling that they don\u2019t belong in this country.\u201d \u201cWay, way back when, somebody yelled that. Not lately,\u201d said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \u201cHowever, the president seems to be resurrecting that.\u201d Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) remembers hearing the taunt throughout his life, starting when he was a young boy. \u201cAt the age of six, my family and I were in a mall, and these two old ladies next to my family and my three sisters said, \u2018Go back to Mexico.\u2019 I think I heard it all the time in high school from every kid who hated me,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard it when I was in the Marine Corps. I heard it when I left the Marine Corps. I heard it in Arizona. I can\u2019t even count the times I\u2019ve heard it.\u201d Lawmakers voted to officially condemn Trump\u2019s racist attack on the four progressive congresswomen. The resolution states the House of Representatives \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cracist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\u201d Representatives voted largely along party lines \u2014 235 Democrats were joined by four Republicans in support of the measure. The Associated Press reports that the Nuclear Regulatory Agency is looking to decrease inspections at nuclear power plants. Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff is recommending that the agency cut back on inspections at the country\u2019s nuclear reactors, a cost-cutting move promoted by the nuclear power industry but denounced by opponents as a threat to public safety. The recommendations, made public Tuesday, include reducing the time and scope of annual inspections at the nation\u2019s 90-plus nuclear power plants. Some other inspections would be cut from every two years to every three years... The nuclear power industry has prodded regulators to cut inspections, saying the nuclear facilities are operating well and that the inspections are a financial burden for power providers. Two lawsuits challenging Trump\u2019s new asylum restrictions have been filed today. The latest was filed in DC federal court, by two immigration advocacy groups. The first, from earlier today, was filed by the ACLU. Both lawsuits are challenging new rules from the Trump administration that would end asylum protections for almost all migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border. As The Guardian reported yesterday: According to the new rules, any asylum seekers who pass through another country before arriving at the southern border \u2013 including children traveling on their own \u2013 will not be eligible for asylum if they failed to apply first in their country of transit. They would only be eligible for US asylum if their application was turned down elsewhere. The change would affect the vast majority of migrants arriving through Mexico. Most of those currently come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, but an increasing number are from Haiti, Cuba and countries further afield in Africa and Asia. As the House continues to debate a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s racist comments, The Washington Post has published an op-ed from representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California, about times people have told him, and still tell him to \u201cGo back to China.\u201d I served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force and currently serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. Yet I still experience people telling me to \u201cgo back\u201d to China or North Korea or Japan. Like many immigrants, I have learned to brush off this racist insult. I never thought the president of the United States would tell members of Congress to \u201cgo back\u201d to another country President Trump has often crossed the line of what constitutes decent behavior. But this time feels different, because he is now attacking legal immigration and U.S. citizenship. His statements on Sunday and since then imply that immigrants are somehow less loyal to our country, less American, and that we should \u201cgo back\u201d or \u201cleave\u201d if we disagree with him. Twenty years ago, I wrote an op-ed in The Post about what it was like to wear my Air Force uniform while people questioned my loyalty to the United States, all because of the color of my skin. I was in my Air Force blues when a woman asked if I was in the Chinese air force. The suspicion that immigrants are not to be trusted or are unpatriotic is not just wrong, it is un-American. And dangerous. The House antitrust committee has just completed its questioning of representatives from Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon in a hearing focused on competition \u2014 and anti-competitive behavior \u2014 in online marketplaces. The four companies spent much of their time claiming that they face fierce competition, to considerable skepticism from committee members. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic congresswoman who represents Amazon\u2019s hometown of Seattle, drew quick blood with sharp questioning of Facebook and Amazon. She pressed Facebook\u2019s director of public policy Matt Perault on whether the company had devoted resources to identifying promising startups and targeting them for acquisition \u2013 a charge Perault denied despite a very public record of Facebook engaging in this behavior. Facebook\u2019s use of a VPN app called Onavo to collect data on rival apps and inform acquisitions such has WhatsApp has been widely reported. The company has also aggressively copied features by startups that have rejected acquisition, including Snapchat and Houseparty. Jayapal also pressed Nate Sutton, Amazon\u2019s associate general counsel for competition, on whether Amazon uses the data it controls on its platform to compete with third-party sellers when it makes its own private brand version of a product \u2013 another widely reported practice that Sutton nevertheless denied engaging in. Cicilline further pressed Sutton on the question, reminding the witness that he was under oath. \u201cWe use data to serve our customers,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\u201d Amazon also faced sharp questioning over the various fees that it levies against sellers, and reports that third-party sellers are pressured to pay Amazon for advertising and fulfillment services in order to compete. This article was amended on 17 July 2019 to correct the last name of Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. And they voted to allow Pelosi to speak, and allow discussion of the Democrats\u2019 resolution to condemn Trump\u2019s comments to continue. Democratic senator and presidential contender Elizabeth Warren who is not involved in the hubbub signaled support for Pelosi. And the \u201cNays\u201d have it. The House votes 190 to 232 against the motion to strike Pelosi\u2019s words from the record. They are also voting on whether to allow Pelosi to speak for the rest of the day. Matt Fuller of HuffPost explains: Meanwhile, Rep. Al Green, a Democrat of Texas says he\u2019s planning to file articles of impeachment against President Trump tonight. As The Washington Post reports: Green\u2019s move will force House Democrats to deal with the issue in the near term. Under House rules, Democratic leadership can decide to try to table the impeachment articles, effectively killing them for now and risk criticism from the party\u2019s liberal base; refer them to the House Judiciary Committee for possible consideration; or allow the vote to proceed. If leaders do nothing, Green can force a vote on the impeachment articles in two legislative days. The move comes as more than 80 members of the House have called for launching an impeachment inquiry. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has resisted, however, encouraging her chairmen to keep investigating the president. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to receive testimony from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III next Wednesday. Maanvi Singh, here, taking up the torch on the West Coast. Members of the House are currently voting on whether to strike from the record House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s remarks calling out Trump\u2019s racist comments. With this vote, members of Congress could essentially change parliamentary precedent stating that lawmakers may not refer to the president making \u201ca bigoted or racist statement.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Republicans defended Donald Trump against charges of racism after Trump in a weekend tweet told members of congress who also are women of color to \u201cgo home\u201d to their countries. \u201cThe president\u2019s not a racist,\u201d senate leader Mitch McConnell said. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of a cynical political ploy. Trump defended himself, tweeting, \u201cThose Tweets were NOT Racist. I don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body!\u201d Trump resumed attacking the congresswomen, accusing them of failing to love their country for their expos\u00e9 of detention center abuses. \u201cThey can leave. They can stay,\u201d he said. Aide Kellyanne Conway demanded to know the ethnic identity of a reporter who questioned where it was that Trump wished the congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to. Watch video here. A planned House vote on a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s tweets as racist was delayed momentarily by a parliamentary scrap on the House floor after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stood on the floor and called Trump\u2019s remarks racist, in apparent violation of rules of decorum. Republicans demanded that Pelosi retract the statement which she refused to do. A House vote on the matter was under way. The senate armed services committee held a confirmation hearing on defense secretary nominee Mark Esper. Elsewhere on the Hill, executives from big tech were called to hearings on privacy and censorship. Drama on the floor: Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, abandoned the chair as fighting continued over Pelosi\u2019s comments on Trump\u2019s racist tweets. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever, ever want to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate, and that\u2019s what this is\u2026we want to just fight,\u201d Cleaver said. Dropping his gavel, he added, \u201cI abandon the chair.\u201d But the House speaker is showing no signs of backing down. Asked by an NBC News reporter whether she would revise her remarks, Pelosi replied, \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d The Trump campaign tapped Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, to spearhead a Women for Trump kickoff event at a casino outside Philadelphia this morning. Here\u2019s Reuters: Lara Trump urged several hundred women to ask their neighbors whether they have more money in their pockets and are paying less taxes since Trump became president. \u201cThe reality is that for a vast majority of Americans the answer is yes,\u201d she told supporters - mostly white women - at the event in the King of Prussia suburb. According to the Reuters/Ipsos 2018 Election Day poll, 56% of suburban women voters in Pennsylvania disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of the country, with 40% saying they approved. Read further. Senator Ted Cruz is firing questions at the Google \u201ccensorship\u201d hearing before the judiciary committee. Cruz is questioning whether Google engages in inappropriate censorship, \u201cchoosing whether to amplify people\u2019s voices... choosing what they see and what they listen to.\u201d Karan Bhatia, veep for government affairs &amp; public policy at Google, is defending what he describes as the company\u2019s standards for hiding or elevating content. You can watch here: House members are still going back and forth about whether Nancy Pelosi should be forced to withdraw her remarks on Trump\u2019s racist tweets because they were \u201cunparliamentary.\u201d The drawn-out debate means that the actual vote on the resolution to condemn the president\u2019s comments will likely be pushed until later this evening. Capitol Hill reporters versed in the minutiae of congressional decorum say the debate is centered on a rule barring \u201creferences to racial or other discrimination on the part of the President.\u201d According to HuffPost\u2019s Matt Fuller, if Pelosi does not withdraw her statement, the House may have to vote on the matter. After Trump backed down last week from a demand that a citizenship question be included on the 2020 Census, administration lawyers have been working with plaintiffs who sued the government to block the attempted move. The lawyers from both sides have informed a judge that they have reached an agreement that would lay the citizenship/2020 question to rest once and for all. The sides propose that the judge impose an order \u201cpermanently enjoining\u201d attempts to add such a question to the 2020 census: A Republican congressman from Texas releases a statement saying he \u201cstrongly disagree[s]\u201d with Trump\u2019s racist tweets \u2013 without using the word \u201cracist\u201d. But Representative Ron Wright does say \u201cwhen one becomes a citizen of this country, it no longer matters where they came from\u201d: Republicans have requested that a statement by House speaker Nancy Pelosi on the House floor declaring that Trump is using disgraceful, disgusting and racist language be taken down, meaning deleted from the official record of the proceedings. Per the congressional research service: Representatives are prohibited from referring negatively to individual Members, identifiable groups of Members, the Speaker, the President, or the Vice President. This prohibition also has been applied to nominated candidates for President and Vice President, including those who are not Members of Congress or an incumbent President or Vice President. Similar restrictions apply to remarks about individual Senators. But Pelosi said she cleared her anticipated comments beforehand with the parliamentarian. It appears the refs are going to the tape on this one. Stay tuned. And here once again to lend some moral clarity to the situation, Anthony Scaramucci Here\u2019s a bit of comic relief. A veteran congressman from New Jersey has taken an Onion spoof that he is angling for inclusion in the Ocasio-Cortez-Omar-Pressley-Tlaib \u201csquad\u201d and run with it: Update: congratulations, congressman. Hawaiian congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has garnered little traction since she launched her presidential campaign. But the military veteran and staunch anti-interventionist is winning headlines today after campaign finance filings revealed a surprising donation: $5,600 from Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. The donations were made the day after Gabbard\u2019s appearance in the Democratic debates, where she turned in a performance that was surprisingly popular among sections of the \u201calt-right\u201d, according to reports by BuzzFeed News and Mother Jones. Dorsey\u2019s personal politics are somewhat oblique. He famously joined in protests in Ferguson, Missouri against the police killing of Mike Brown, appearing on stage with prominent protester DeRay McKesson wearing a Twitter-branded t-shirt reading \u201c#StayWoke\u201d. He also opposed a tax on wealthy San Francisco businesses that would help fund services for homeless people, and has drawn intense criticism for failing to crack down on white nationalists and other hate figures on Twitter. Gabbard is one of the handful of Democratic candidates who supports breaking up big tech companies, a policy position that could actually be helpful to Dorsey personally. One of his companies, Twitter, competes with Facebook on social networking, while the other, Square, is a payments processor that likely does not want to see Facebook muscle into that space. In late March, Dorsey donated $1000 to another long-shot Democratic candidate, Andrew Yang, according to FEC filings. The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing with executives from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple has been delayed an hour due to a vote. But the line to get a seat for what is guaranteed to be a grilling from lawmakers on whether the tech giants\u2019 market dominance stifles competition already stretches all the way down a Capitol Hill hallway, per a reporter there. Here\u2019s some video of McConnell: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has attempted to thread a needle in defending Trump against charges of racism, saying that legal immigration, as for example in his wife\u2019s case, has \u201cbeen reinvigorating America for hundreds of years\u201d. Asked how he felt about Trump\u2019s \u201cgo back to your country\u201d line given that his wife, transportation secretary Elaine Chao, is a naturalized citizen who arrived in the United States as a child, McConnell responded: \u201cWell the secretary of transportation came here at age 8, legally, not speaking a word of English, and has realized the American dream,\u201d McConnell says. He calls legal immigration \u201ca process of renewal that has gone on in this country for a very long time and we ought to renew it.\u201d \u201cLegal immigration has been a fulfilling of the American dream.... My wife is a good example of that,\u201d he continues. \u201cLook, I\u2019m obviously a big fan of legal immigration, it\u2019s been a big part of my family for a quarter of a century... it\u2019s been reinvigorating America for hundreds of years.\u201d But McConnell won\u2019t condemn the president and depicts Trump\u2019s racism as a two-sided war of words. \u201cI think everybody ought to tone down their rhetoric,\u201d he says. \u201cThe president\u2019s not a racist. And I think the tone of all of this is not good for the country. But it\u2019s coming from all ideological points of view... to single out any segment of this I think is a mistake.\u201d For the record, only one side is telling people of color born in the United States to go back to their countries. But McConnell\u2019s strategy here was notably different from that of the House leadership this morning, which simply dug in, vowed that Trump was not racist and basically suggested anyone who thought so was nuts. The House leadership looked as if it wanted to deepen the current argument. McConnell looked as if he was hoping to get past it. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell opens his news conference with a call for greater civility in [GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY] discourse. Saying political rhetoric has become \u201coverheated\u201d, McConnell called on leaders to \u201clower the temperature\u201d and \u201craise the level of discourse.\u201d Then they pivot to talk of tax cuts. The Republican leadership will formally recommend that members vote against a House resolution this evening condemning Trump\u2019s racist tweets, Politico quotes a spokesperson for leadership as saying. That\u2019s a signal to the rank-and-file that leadership is watching. The vote has become a loyalty test to party. The leadership did not need to draw such distinct battle lines. Or have the Democrats by bringing the resolution cornered the Republicans into making a racist Trump tweet into a party loyalty test? In any case it\u2019s all hands on deck now. According to a report from the White House press pool, Trump has been asked where the four House Democratic congresswomen should go if they leave the United States. Trump says \u201cthey can stay\u201d then attacks the members of Congress for their critique of the conditions inside migrant detention centers at the border, which critique sparked Trump\u2019s racist tweets of Sunday. Trump accuses the members of Congress of not loving the USA. The members might reply that their whole point was that a great country like the United States can do better than caging children. But in Trump\u2019s rubric criticism amounts to treason. He said: It\u2019s up to them. Wherever they want \u2013 or they can stay. But they should love our country. They shouldn\u2019t hate our country. I have clips right here. The most vile, horrible statements about our country. About Israel. About others. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them. Do what they want. They can leave. They can stay. They should love our country, and they should work for the good of our country. Mitt Romney summons a masterfully mild framework for Trump\u2019s racist attack on members of congress: it\u2019s a failure of the duty to unite, you see. A federal judge has ordered Roger Stone, the former Trump adviser, to refrain from using social media after she found that he violated a previous gag order forbidding him from discussing his case online. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Stone on Tuesday that he could not use Instagram or other social media platforms while the case against him moves forward, the Associated Press reported. She said the punishment was necessary because he had proven unwilling to adhere to her orders and to refrain from publicly commenting on the case. Stone is charged with witness tampering and lying to congressional lawmakers in their investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. It can seem as if the Trump administration is in willful, determined pursuit of the destruction of the American ideal and legacy, as a melting pot nation that holds all individuals to be Americans first in the public square no matter their religions, ethnicities, races, identities or beliefs. First the president tells American citizens of color \u2013 members of congress, no less \u2013 to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries. Then Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, trying to deny that Trump\u2019s tweets were racist, demands to know a reporter\u2019s ethnic identity. Addressing reporters outside the White House, Conway insisted that Trump, by tweeting \u201cWhy don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d, did not mean that the members of congress should visit countries once inhabited by their ancestors. But wait, said Andrew Feinberg, a White House reporter for Breakfast Media. So what \u201ccountries\u201d was the president referring to, then? At which Conway made this jaw-dropping reply: \u201cWhat\u2019s your ethnicity?\u201d Feinberg: Uh, why is that relevant? Conway: Because I\u2019m asking you a question. My ancestors are from Ireland and Italy. Feinberg: My ethnicity is not relevant to the question. Conway: It is, because you\u2019re asking about, he said \u2018originally\u2019. He said \u2018originally from\u2019. [Fact check: three of the four members of Congress in question are \u201coriginally from\u201d the United States, unless where you were born... is not the same as where you are from... because you are... not white?] That\u2019s a fairly powerful counterpoint to the op-ed this morning in the Washington Post by Conway\u2019s husband, George Conway, titled \u201cTrump is a racist president\u201d: No matter how much I found him ultimately unfit, I still gave him the benefit of the doubt about being a racist. No matter how much I came to dislike him, I didn\u2019t want to think that the president of the United States is a racial bigot. But Sunday left no doubt. Naivete, resentment and outright racism, roiled in a toxic mix, have given us a racist president. Mike Pence did not take questions about his boss\u2019s racist tweets, or anything else, during an event where he unveiled the spacesuit worn by Neil Armstrong on the moon half a century ago. Speaking at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington on Tuesday, the vice president remained characteristically loyal. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, it is now the policy of the United States of America to return to the moon within the next five years, and, from there, onto Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a feeling that the man who wore the suit that we will unveil today would be glad to know that the first woman and the next man on the moon will also be an American. \u201cApollo 11 is the only event of the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century. And that\u2019s what makes a day like today so important. A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969, will likely be a date that will live on in the minds and imaginations of men and women here on Earth, across our solar system, and beyond.\u201d On 16 July 1969, Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins blasted off from Pad 39-A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin its historic quarter-million-mile journey to the moon, with Armstrong and Aldrin setting foot on the lunar surface four days later. In a speech watched by the late astronaut\u2019s wife, son and grandson, Pence observed that the nation \u201chad been deeply divided during the tumultuous 1960s\u201d but for a moment \u201cthe man who wore this suit brought together our nation and the world\u201d. The Armstrong spacesuit goes on public show for the first time in 13 years. Its conservation, display and digitisation were crowd funded. Lawyers for Roger Stone, the political... pirate?... and former Trump adviser, are in court this morning pleading against a government allegation that he has not complied with a gag order in discussing his case. Reuters has this: [Judge Amy Berman] Jackson in February ordered Stone to stop speaking publicly about the case after he posted what appeared to be a threatening photo of her next to the image of gun crosshairs on his Instagram account. In that hearing Stone tried to apologize, saying the posting was not intended as a threat. But a visibly angry Jackson said his apology \u201crings quite hollow\u201d and warned him he would not have a second chance if he failed to abide by her order. As part of today\u2019s hearing, Jackson is reading Stone\u2019s instagram posts, reports Zoe Tillman of Buzzfeed: The hearing is currently in recess. Lawyers for accusers of Jeffrey Epstein, the financier facing two federal sex trafficking counts in New York, have urged a judge in the case not to grant Epstein\u2019s request for release following a bail hearing on Thursday: A lawyer for one of Epstein\u2019s accusers has alleged that Epstein committed abuse while in custody following the Florida plea deal, meanwhile. Read further: It\u2019s rather a violent business. With each wrenching descent by Trump further into this nightmare of explicit bigotry emanating from the White House, the question always hangs for a moment of whether the Republican party will follow \u2013 whether they will take the step too, and go down there. There\u2019s a pause \u2013 in this case, 48 hours. Then the party takes the step down. And then Trump makes sure everyone sees what just happened. Here he paraphrases McCarthy, accurately: The senate armed services committee is currently holding a confirmation hearing for Mark Esper, Donald Trump\u2019s latest nominee to fill the secretary of defense post. Trump\u2019s previous nominee to replace General Jim Mattis, General Patrick Shanahan, withdrew his nomination in June amid a delayed FBI background check and revelations about past family troubles. Esper is asked about his views on international allegiances. Does he agree more with Trump, who seems to hold traditional allies in low esteem, or Mattis, a defender of Nato and other post-World War II global political compacts? \u201cI am fully committed to building alliances,\u201d Esper says: Esper served briefly as acting defense secretary, then upon his formal nomination reverted to his previous role as army secretary. How did that outing by the House Republican leadership go? What did you make of the Republicans\u2019 pained appeal just then for a return to civility? Was McCarthy convincing in defending the president against charges of racism? Here\u2019s video of the moment when minority leader McCarthy is asked whether Trump\u2019s tweets were racist: McCarthy announces last question. He\u2019s asked whether he agrees with Trump\u2019s reported assessment of former House speaker Paul Ryan as \u201cstupid.\u201d McCarthy says Ryan was a \u201cgreat Speaker\u201d and calls him a great friend. Then McCarthy suggests that the quote is made up. They are done. They walk out to somebody saying \u201ca question? On socialism?\u201d Those were the great themes of the conference: Socialism, impeachment, and a supposed clash of ideologies \u2013 as opposed to a clash of bigotries \u2013 that defines the current political showdown. The strategy was to attack the four members of Congress who warned the public in a news conference yesterday \u201cdo not take the bait\u201d \u2013 in a fight Republicans seem eager to escalate. In any case, the Republican House leadership stands foursquare behind the president. Were the president\u2019s tweets racist? A one-word answer: No. \u201cLet\u2019s not be false about what is happening here today,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cThis is all about politics and beliefs about ideologies that people have.\u201d Then he gets a question about lifting an imminent debt ceiling (early September or sooner). \u201cWe should not leave before getting that,\u201d he says. Next Q: Were the president\u2019s \u201cgo back\u201d to your country tweets racist? A flat \u201cNo\u201d from McCarthy. Then he says such charges amount to a cynical political play by Democrats. \u201cThis is more from their base, this is about politics,\u201d McCarthy says. He also frames the conflict thus: \u201cThis is about ideology. This is about socialism vs freedom.\u201d He says he will vote \u2018No\u2019 on the House resolution condemning Trump\u2019s tweets. \u201cThis party has been very clear,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are the party of Lincoln.\u201d First question from the media. Why can\u2019t Congress pass comprehensive immigration reform? McCarthy... blames the Democrats. With Donald Trump in office, the rock in the stream blocking immigration reform is the Democratic House majority. \u201cWe should act,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cThe responsibility lies with us... we should make sure that we fix this problem.\u201d Sounds promising. Representative Steve Scalise now attacks Reps Omar and Pressley \u2013 though he does use the honorific, just their last names. Scalise attacks the pair for having \u201cpersonally attack[ed] president Trump instead of focusing on issues that help the economy.\u201d He accuses them of saying \u201cfalse and misleading things from this microphone. Omar continues to use terms like \u2018people drinking out of toilets\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s not happening in any of the detention facilities.\u201d Those reports did not come from Omar exclusively of course, they are documented in multiple watchdog reports from Clint, Texas and elsewhere. \u201cPressley would not even refer to the president by the title,\u201d Scalise complains. Republicans are lamenting an erosion of decorum, echoing Trump\u2019s recent tweets complaining about the \u201cracist\u201d charge. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, is now speaking. The House Republicans have emerged. Representative Liz Cheney (daughter of Dick) of Wyoming speaks first. She makes a speech that basically asserts that \u201cGo back to your country\u201d is a policy critique. She does not use the word racist but repeats and repeats the word \u201csocialist\u201d and attacks Democrats for supporting abortion rights and for wanting, she says, to \u201cforce the American people to pay for free healthcare for illegal immigrants.\u201d \u201cOur opposition to our socialist colleagues has absolutely nothing to do with their gender, their religion or their race,\u201d Cheney says. \u201cOur opposition... has absolutely nothing to do with race, or gender or religion,\u201d she repeats. \u201cThe issue here is the content of their policies\u201d. \u201cGo back to your country\u201d: a policy critique. The president tweets that he does not have a racist bone in his body and calls a planned House vote today condemning them a \u201cDemocrat con game\u201d. He says that the four women members of Congress who have confronted his racism \u201chate our Country\u201d and argues that he has hit on a political winner. Is this sheet music for Republicans to sing from at their news conferences today? Will McCarthy et al. echo Trump\u2019s charged denial that it is not racist to tell a person of color (who is American) to \u201cgo back\u201d to their country? In a few minutes we\u2019re due to hear from the House Republican leadership: Reps. Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise, Liz Cheney and Virginia Foxx. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have decided not to bring charges against a police officer involved in the death five years ago of Eric Garner, whose dying words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d helped to galvanize a national movement against police violence. The justice department planned to tell Garner\u2019s family on Tuesday morning that no charges would be brought against officer Daniel Pantaleo, the New York Times first reported. Pantaleo has been on desk duty since Garner\u2019s death. He is awaiting the results of a police department review of the incident. Pantaleo threw Garner to a sidewalk in Staten Island, NY, using a banned chokehold, and the victim suffered a fatal asthma attack.

He\u2019s not letting his hosts off easy, zinging Jeff Bezos and the sponsors. In their news conference Monday afternoon, the four congresswomen attacked by Trump \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley \u2013 warned the public, \u201cdo not take the bait\u201d. The line pointed to the perceived political risk for Democrats of giving in to an identity-politics war that Trump has eagerly joined. \u201cThe more media/Dems engage him, the better for him,\u201d tweets Amy Walter, the national editor of the Cook Political Report, on Twitter. But is Trump really playing political chess here? The New York Times\u2019 Alex Burns notes that the last political play Trump made on the eve of an election was to fearmonger about migrant \u201ccaravans\u201d moving through Central America \u2013 and that did not work at all: For more along these lines, read Guardian Washington bureau chief David Smith (@smithinamerica): It was foul and repugnant. But was it a vote winner? Donald Trump\u2019s bigoted tirade against four congresswoman of colour, telling them to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, prompted widespread revulsion \u2013 the comments \u201cdrip with racism\u201d, said the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer \u2013 and yet will not necessarily damage his chances of reelection. On the contrary, the US president seems to regard divisive and nativist rhetoric as his best chance of clinging on to the White House next year. And, analysts say, he may be right. Read further: Hello and welcome to our live politics coverage. After two days of silence on Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgo back where you came from\u201d tweets attacking four members of congress who are also women of color, the Republican leadership faces something of a moment of truth on Tuesday, with both the House and Senate leadership due to face reporters in their weekly news conferences. The House leadership speaks at 10am ET, the Senate at 2pm. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Monday that he would \u201cbe happy\u201d to take questions about whether the party stands behind the president\u2019s racist attack on the members of Congress, which Trump kept up on Twitter on Tuesday morning. This evening Republicans in the House will face another test, when the body is expected to vote on a resolution (text here) \u201ccondemning president Trump\u2019s racist comments directed at members of Congress\u201d. Extremely few Republicans have indicated support for the resolution. The congresswomen convened a joint news conference on Capitol Hill Monday afternoon in which they accused Trump of following an \u201cagenda of white nationalists\u201d and exhorted, \u201cdo not take the bait\u201d. Two other major events were planned on the Hill Tuesday. At noon, the House is expected to vote to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for forestalling congressional investigations into the Trump administration effort to include a citizenship question on the 2020 US Census. At 2pm, representatives of the big tech companies \u2013 Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple \u2013 were scheduled to testify before a House judiciary subcommittee about \u201conline platforms and market power.\u201d We\u2019ll be following that in real time right here. We\u2019ll also be chasing the 2020 Democratic candidates. Thanks for joining us.",
