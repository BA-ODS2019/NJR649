      "bodyText": "Donald Trump kicked off his weekend with a stinging attack on Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chair of the House oversight committee, that opponents including House speaker Nancy Pelosi said was another example of the president deploying racist invective for political ends. Apparently responding to the Fox News magazine show Fox &amp; Friends, the president called Cummings a \u201cbrutal bully\u201d and said his congressional district was both \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d and \u201cthe worst run and most dangerous [district] anywhere in the United States\u201d. In response, Cummings said that though it was his \u201cconstitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch\u201d, it was his \u201cmoral duty\u201d to fight for his constituents. Cummings, who is African American, represents Maryland\u2019s seventh congressional district, covering parts of Baltimore and neighbouring counties. The district is majority African American and has been held by Democrats since 1953. According to the US Census Bureau the seventh, like many districts in the US, has problems with unemployment and poverty. It also has problems with gun-related crime. The district also includes suburban areas, in one of which Trump\u2019s housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson, has a home. Trump said Cummings should \u201chelp clean up this very dangerous and filthy place\u201d. Some observers linked his tweets to widely condemned remarks he reportedly made in the Oval Office last year, calling El Salvador, Haiti and some African nations \u201cshithole countries\u201d. The president later doubled down on his attacks, accusing Cummings of doing \u201cnothing but milk Baltimore dry\u201d. Furthermore, the president\u2019s vitriolic attack on a senior African American Democrat came two weeks after he told four Democratic congresswomen of colour they should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from. Only one of the congresswomen was not born in the US and all are American citizens. Critics observed that Trump\u2019s attacks on \u201cthe Squad\u201d were meant to mobilise his base and force Democrats to defend progressives who advocate policies possibly unpopular in swing states in next year\u2019s election. Responding to Trump on Saturday, Cummings also drew attention to a hearing on Friday about \u201cskyrocketing prices of prescription drugs and the financial hardships that families across the nation, and in Baltimore, are facing\u201d. Trump should work with him on the problem, he said. Pelosi voiced support for Cummings, saying: \u201cWe all reject racist attacks against him and support his steadfast leadership.\u201d Campaigning for the presidential nomination in New Hampshire, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Trump\u2019s \u201cracist tweets\u201d were \u201cbeyond insulting. It is disgusting. This president brings shame to himself and to the White House.\u201d Baltimore\u2019s mayor, Jack Young, called Trump \u201ca disappointment to the people\u201d of his city and to \u201cour country, and to the world\u201d. Cummings, he said, was a \u201cpatriot and a hero\u201d. The president of the Maryland State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Gerald Stansbury, said Trump should be impeached, as \u201cAmerica deserves a president who lifts our cities up, not one who heaps trash talk on them\u201d. Trump called Cummings a bully for, he said, \u201cshouting and screaming at the great men and women of Border Patrol about conditions at the southern border\u201d. \u201cHis Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous,\u201d Trump said, calling it without offering evidence \u201cthe Worst in the USA\u201d. The Fox &amp; Friends segment Trump appeared to have watched showed Cummings questioning the US Customs and Border Protection commissioner and acting homeland security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, this month. On Thursday, Cummings told reporters the treatment of migrant children at the southern border was \u201cgovernment-sponsored child abuse\u201d. Characteristically, the president also advocated an investigation of a political foe. \u201cWhy is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States,\u201d he said, still without offering evidence to back up his claim. \u201cNo human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!\u201d On Friday, Trump again suggested his predecessor in the Oval Office, Barack Obama, should be investigated as he himself has been. Cummings is part of a House leadership that has not rushed to impeach Trump, as more than 100 Democrats in the House now advocate. But after Wednesday\u2019s testimony by former special counsel Robert Mueller, about his report on Russian election interference, links between Trump and Moscow and possible obstruction of justice, Cummings made a passionate statement. \u201cI\u2019m begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if you want to have a democracy intact for your children, and your children\u2019s children, and generations yet unborn we\u2019ve got to guard this moment \u2026 This is our watch.\u201d",

It would be nice to know that people still care, says Warialda farmer Lilly Hollow, 33. \u201cIt\u2019s a lonely and unrelenting battle at the moment.\u201d Lilly Hollow has been hand feeding her stock every day for the past two years, as an intense period of drought continues to grip the region. Keepit and Split Rock Dams are important water sources for the Namoi Valley, including Walgett. They now sit at just 1% and 2.2% of capacity respectively. A diving platform rests in the dust of Keepit dam, with no water in sight. Gravestones from a 160 year old homestead flooded at the same dams construction have been uncovered by the receding waters, providing a morbid reminder of just how dry things have become. Clockwise from top left: Exposed gravestones of the former Huntsgrove Homestead; Split Rock dam at 2.2% capacity; dry country near the town of Warialda; and a pontoon now over 100m from the water supply at Keepiit dam. A few kilometres outside the small North Western slopes town of Warialda, Lilly Hollow runs 40 cattle, down from 90 at the onset of the drought, on her 960 acre property. Hollow keeps her tractor parked by the house, rolling out of bed each morning to hand feed her stock in the dark before heading off to a 9-5 job. It\u2019s a relentless and unforgiving routine necessitated by an unprecedented lack of rain in the area. 2018 saw less than half the average annual local rainfall. The 140mm received so far this year is the lowest on record for the region. \u201cI\u2019m fiercely independent, but you need to be able to rely on those close to you,\u201d says Hollow. Lilly Hollow (L) and her twin sister Catherine. Joining Lilly on the day of my visit was her twin sister Catherine, now based in Sydney after leaving the country to pursue a career in radiology. \u201cWe have a connection; it\u2019s a twins thing. I know when Lilly is doing it tough, and when I need to come home,\u201d says Catherine. During a tour of the property Lilly stops her ute near the bones of her \u201ckeeper heifer\u201d, Twisty (named for her bright yellow colour), lost to illness just a few weeks prior. The sisters embrace, shedding a tear in a moment of release. It\u2019s a display of raw emotion that\u2019s been common during my time in regional Australia during the drought. A bright neon blue cross lights up the yard of a Coonabarabran industrial estate. Twelve months ago, after first hearing of the unfolding drought crisis via the regional press, I headed to the town of Coonabarabran, which was then on Level 6 emergency water restrictions. In 2018, the scene was dire at Windy Hill farm, which is run by fourth-generation farmers Jess and Robert Taylor. The dams were empty, the paddocks littered with the rotting carcasses of fallen stock. Clouds of dust whipped up as cattle rushed for scarce rations hand fed by the family, which includes four young kids, Harry, Charlie, Bonnie and Heidi. Last year the oldest, Harry, then just turned 6, had asked for rain for his birthday. No rain fell that day, and not a drop would arrive for another 6 months. This year the situation is slightly improved, yet the family remain on edge. \u201cIt\u2019s tenuous,\u201d says Jess Taylor of their situation. \u201cHarry asked for rain again for his birthday, and this year he actually got a few millimetres. We have some hope.\u201d 60 kilometres from the Taylor\u2019s, their close friends the Jerry family are fifth generation farmers running sheep and cattle on their property Maryborough. At the head of the family is Coral Jerry, 81, who lives on the farm alone after her husband of 55 years died in 2015. Coral\u2019s son Greg and wife Tanya manage the farm on daily visits from town. Maryborough, 40km north-east of Coonabarabran. It is here the cruel lottery of recent rainfall hits home. In 2018 the farm looked nothing short of apocalyptic; vast paddocks of red earth and dust populated by skeletal livestock. It has barely rained here since. Images of sick and dying livestock on the Jerry\u2019s property helped to jolt the nation into action. But according to Greg, the charity that flooded in, while greatly appreciated, faded away just as quickly as it came. \u201cIt feels like we have been forgotten,\u201d says Jerry. Jerry is not sure how long the family can hold out. \u201cI\u2019ve re-mortgaged and stretched as much as I can. There have been some storms around, we just haven\u2019t been under them.\u201d On an afternoon spent with the unstoppable Coral, harsh reminders of the situation kept coming. In search of a cow Coral had identified earlier in the day as weak, we found the animal alive but collapsed from hunger. \u201cIt\u2019s the crows that are the problem now,\u201d Coral tells me, explaining how quickly the birds arrive to pick at the eyes of fallen stock. After placing a blanket over the cow\u2019s head, the rest of the herd surrounded the cow in a moving display of protection for their fallen mate. Coral would later return with her son to move the cow back to an area where they would attempt to hand feed her back to health. A herd of cows gather around their fallen mate, who has collapsed from hunger at the Jerry family farm outside Coonabarabran. \u201cIt has to be our turn soon,\u201d says Coral of the lack of rain. \u201cI just don\u2019t stop, if I do, that will be it.\u201d I\u2019m continually struck by the sheer physical and mental energy expended by people working the land during the drought. Many farmers have simply walked away. Others battle on, fighting to keep businesses often handed down for generations. In the Northern tableland\u2019s region, usually a safe haven during drought, the situation is no better. The town of Guyra is relying on water being trucked in. Nearby to the town are a string of upland wetlands (or montane lagoons), internationally recognised for their rarity and importance as a haven for rare birdlife. The lagoons are now bone dry. Frost covers the now empty Little Llangothlin lagoon. Cassandra McLaren is a Merriwa farmer who runs the popular Facebook hub \u2018One Day Closer to Rain,\u2019 which is helping to connect struggling farmers. She is also a volunteer for the Lyon\u2019s charity \u2018needforfeed.org\u2019. McLaren says \u201cfarmers are determined\u201d, \u201cbut they are not sure how much longer they can continue. It\u2019s important for people to know this drought is far from over.\u201d Ambrose Doolan and his wife, Lisa, run 9,000 acres with Angus cattle outside of Coonabarabran on their property, Toorawandi. Their daughter Emily returned to the farm at the onset of the drought to lend a hand. Ambrose, despite the often-desperate state of the family property, remains optimistic \u201cWe have to be closer to the end of this than the beginning,\u201d he says. Lilly Hollow sums up a common theme amongst the farmers I\u2019ve met. \u201cI have fierce love for this life and land, even when it\u2019s at its harshest. I see the beauty through the dust and am grateful every day I can be out here.\u201d",

While patches of 5G networks are already available in some Australian cities, it won\u2019t be until at least 2020 that 5G has any real impact, and several more years until the networks are completed. So until then, what is all the fuss about? What is 5G? 5G is a marketing term for the fifth generation of mobile networks. The ones people tend to remember are 3G and 4G because they coincided with the rise of smartphones equipped for everyday internet use. 5G is the next phase, and will offer much higher speeds and lower latency (faster response time) than is available on 4G. 5G operates in radio waves like 4G, but at much higher frequencies \u2013 anywhere between 1GHz and 300GHz, compared with the most prominent band for 4G in Australia, 700MHz. Initially 5G in Australia will operate in a lower band (3.6GHz) but the telecommunications companies will eventually seek access to higher bands that will allow them to deliver services via millimetre wave (the band between 30GHz and 300GHz). Millimetre wave is higher frequency spectrum than mobile networks have had access to in the past. The government sells licences at auctions to use higher bands. As with previous generations, 5G will work with 4G until eventually every user has moved across, and the legacy networks can be deactivated. Australian networks still run 3G as a fallback, despite 4G now being the standard. How is it different from what I have today? The biggest advantages of 5G are the sheer amount of data it can transfer and the extremely low latency, which affects how fast pages load. Eventually there will be download speeds of up to 10Gbps, which is 10 times higher than the highest package on offer on the fibre-to-the-premises NBN. At the moment, however, 5G speeds are currently trailing below 4G speeds in Australia, according to market analysis site OpenSignal. That is, in part, because it is still a fairly new technology that hasn\u2019t been rolled out in many locations, but also because companies in Australia are not using the higher spectrum band, which would offer much higher speeds. The initial phase of 5G will be similar to 4G and 3G, but once the telecommunications companies have access to the much higher frequency spectrum then more data can be funnelled through the network. 5G beamforming allows more efficient transfer of data by directly targeting users seeking data rather than the current approach which scatters the data everywhere at once, creating a lot of noise. It will also be good for the arrival of the so-called \u201cinternet of things\u201d. In a time where just about everything is connected to the internet in some way, 5G allows networks to keep up with the traffic demand for the foreseeable future. The lower latency also brings 5G closer to replicating the experience of using a service that is right in your home or office. On 3G, response time is usually around 100 milliseconds, while on 4G it is about 30 milliseconds. On 5G it is promised to be as low as 1 millisecond. This provides a lot of benefit for businesses on 5G that isn\u2019t available on 4G today. Commonwealth Bank, for example, is trialling 5G for edge computing. In cloud computing today, all the data and applications are stored centrally and accessed over networks.

Not in the immediate future. It\u2019s still a long way off from from being ubiquitous or posing any major threat to fixed-line networks you connect in homes or businesses today, usually via wifi connected to fibre or cable connections offered by companies such as the NBN. Telstra says only around 15% of its mobile customers don\u2019t have a fixed-line internet service at home. That\u2019s low now, but if users have access to a more reliable service that is priced the same as fixed without all the hassle of getting set up for a new connection, there\u2019s a good chance NBN could be in trouble. Optus has focused its initial launch of 5G on offering home broadband for unlimited downloads at 50Mbps for $70 per month. This is extremely competitive with the NBN, on which Optus offers the same plan starting at $85 per month. NBN, meanwhile, is testing the waters for its own 5G, even while there remains ongoing issues with its fixed 4G network for regional areas of Australia. What does it mean for my phone? Analyst firm Telsyte predicts adoption of 5G handsets in Australia will be quicker than it was for 4G, getting to 15m 5G phones in Australia between six and 12 months sooner than 4G. Part of the reason behind that, Telsyte has said, is because 5G handsets will be available sooner than 4G handsets were. It was a full three months after Telstra initially launched 4G that the first handset was available in Australia. So far, Samsung, LG, Oppo and Huawei have announced 5G handsets for Australia. Telecommunications companies in Australia seem to believe 5G is not just your standard upgrade and people should be willing to pay more to access the network. But the Telsyte research stated just one in four users were willing to pay more for 5G, at an average of $5 to $10 extra per month. Telstra is currently offering 5G for free for the next 12 months in the extremely limited 35 areas it is available, but after that customers will have to pay $15 per month extra unless they\u2019re on one of the two most expensive monthly plans. Are there health risks? With each new technology, there is the inevitable \u201cwon\u2019t it cause cancer\u201d or some other such controversy. Protest groups have formed around the world, including several in Australia, warning about health dangers associated with 5G. In particular, they are concerned about the impact that the new millimetre wave technology will have on humans. The World Health Organisation has found that \u201cdespite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health\u201d. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, has declared there are no established health effects from radio waves that 5G uses, and has even gone to the trouble of setting up a page specifically devoted to the misinformation surrounding 5G. Arpansa notes that because 5G operates in higher frequencies, the energy is absorbed mostly within the surface of the skin, and there are already a range of devices that use higher frequencies, such as security screenings in airports, police radar guns, remote sensors and in medicine. Research into the health effects is ongoing. Why was Huawei banned from 5G in Australia? That\u2019s more a political than technical question. There have been long-running fears in the security agencies in the five-eyes countries about Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese government. Up until recent law changes, the Australian government had no power to tell a company such as Telstra or Optus that it couldn\u2019t use a certain supplier in its networks if there were security concerns. Huawei was already banned by the government from supplying to NBN because the government owns NBN and can tell it what to do, but after the law change the government banned certain Chinese suppliers from being involved in 5G in Australia. Huawei is used in 4G networks in Australia today, but the government argues that is for the radio network, not the core of the 4G networks. In 5G, the government argued, that is less separated, making it difficult to unscramble the egg. Telstra has argued that through its long-standing partnership with Ericsson, the company is not disadvantaged by Huawei being banned. Telstra told Guardian Australia that Ericsson\u2019s technology is developed to the same level as what Huawei has on offer. TPG in January, however, canned its $100m investment in building a 4G network as a result of the ban. The company had been constructing the 4G network with Huawei as its main vendor, and had aimed to upgrade the network to 5G using more Huawei network gear, but said that it did not make commercial sense to continue constructing the network given Huawei was banned.",

      "bodyText": "Extreme climate events such as heatwaves, floods and drought damaged 45% of the marine ecosystems along Australia\u2019s coast in a seven-year period, CSIRO research shows. More than 8,000km of Australia\u2019s coast was affected by extreme climate events from 2011 to 2017, and in some cases they caused irreversible changes to marine habitats. The study collated all the published research by leading scientists, who have examined the effects of marine heatwaves, heavy rainfall from tropical storms, cyclones and droughts on coral, kelp, mangrove and seagrass communities. It paints a bigger picture of the extent to which the climate crisis is fuelling widespread change across Australia\u2019s marine ecosystems. The study found that big climate events were exacerbating the effects of human-induced climate change. Heatwaves, for example, compounded the effects of the underlying global heating trend and left little time for organisms to adapt. \u201cAll of the people around the country working on these systems for years have done a great job of documenting the impacts and repercussions,\u201d Russ Babcock, the study\u2019s lead author, said. \u201cIf you stand back and have a look at how many [climate events] have happened between that period of 2011 to 2017, it really backs up that it\u2019s not just the Great Barrier Reef that we have to think about. It\u2019s all around the country.\u201d The team of scientists looked at events, including the 2011 marine heatwave in Western Australia, cyclone Yasi, the back-to-back mass bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, and the mangrove dieback in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 2015-16. They also examined what the longer term repercussions of these events could be, given some areas had shown little, if any, sign of recovery. \u201cSome of our models showed it can take 15 years to recover from impacts like this,\u201d Babcock said, noting that during that timeframe it was likely that more extreme events would occur. He cited the large areas off the Western Australia coast where kelp canopies had not recovered since the 2011 marine heatwave. Babcock said the long-term effects of such events affected other species, such as large animals that fed off sea grasses, which could lead to changes in the composition of entire marine communities. \u201cSo things that we value about those habitats \u2013 the diversity of plants and animals there and the amount of things like fisheries you can harvest from them \u2013 can be affected,\u201d he said. \u201cI think one of the important things is going to be to study the factors that make a difference in terms of the recovery of these habitats and therefore learn what we might be able to do to help them recover more quickly.\u201d Coral reef scientist Terry Hughes is one of the researchers whose work was referenced in the CSIRO study. Hughes said the paper showed how serious the outlook was for all marine systems, not just coral reefs, which typically received more public attention. \u201cOther marine systems \u2013 kelps, seagrasses, mangroves \u2013 are just as vulnerable as reefs but they\u2019re not the poster child,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised ... but it\u2019s good to have the big picture and make the point that it\u2019s a huge issue for all coastal areas of Australia.

      "bodyText": "Like most people, during my 20s and 30s my experience with the health system was largely routine \u2013 GP visits, the occasional emergency ward appearance for a broken leg (mixed indoor netball is a tough sport). I was healthy and so didn\u2019t really think much about the workings of the health system until something unexpected occurred \u2013 the birth of our second child, who has Down\u2019s syndrome. The first week after her birth as we waited for test results and confirmation of the diagnosis was as stressful a time my wife and I have ever experienced. Fortunately our daughter Emma lay peacefully in her humidicrib in the Canberra hospital neonatal ICU (and as an aside, if there are any true heroes walking among us it is the nurses who work in those wards). So small and in need of warmth was she that I was rarely able to hold her, and I felt utterly useless and disconnected. As we had named her after one of our favourite literary characters, my way to bond with her was to spend nights in the dimly lit ICU sitting next to her humidicrib, tearfully and softly reading the Jane Austen novel to her. So yeah. I was pretty much a wreck. And among the worries I had about her future was the wonder of how we were going to pay for it all. In retrospect it was a slightly dopey thought \u2013 perhaps stemming from too much infiltration of US TV into my system where I was reacting like someone who, after witnessing a crime, thinks to dial 911. I had little understanding of what Down\u2019s syndrome was: what care would be required, what operations would be needed (we were very lucky, in that she did not require any surgery to repair her heart or intestines which can often be the case for babies with DS)? But above it all I kept thinking, cripes, how are we going to pay for it? I guess I can be excused due to the stress, but it didn\u2019t occur to me until later that the very place in which I was having those worries and where my daughter was receiving amazing care was a public hospital \u2013 and that we of course do not live in the US \u2013 we have Medicare. And let us all pause and give thanks that we do. Now sure, there have in the 13 years since been numerous private medical expenses \u2013 mostly specialists \u2013 ophthalmologists, ear, nose and throat specialists and the like. And there have of course been out-of-pocket expenses. But mostly the public system has been there \u2013 either firstly through TherapyACT, or then the NDIS. And when things went bad \u2013 such as in her first two years when she was hospitalised each winter with bronchiolitis and had be put on a respirator to keep her oxygen levels up \u2013 there we were once again in the Canberra hospital getting great care. In the 2016 election the big issue was the supposed desire of the Liberal party to privatise Medicare. It was never a stated policy, and the ALP had to face a lot of questioning over how truthful they were being. There were suggestions that it could never happen but the scare campaign was enough to get the ALP very close to winning government. Australians overwhelmingly love Medicare. And they should. And they overwhelmingly hate private health insurance. And they are right to. Mostly private health care is now a thing taken out to avoid paying the Medicare levy surcharge. And more and more what is being offered is insurance with a myriad of exclusions and excess co-payments. Little wonder that young people are leaving the private health system. Bizarrely though as well this week came the suggestion from the managing director of private health insurer NIB, Mark Fitzgibbon, in an opinion piece in the AFR that the government should scrap Medicare and \u201cmake private health insurance compulsory for all Australians with taxation devoted to subsidising the premiums for those who would otherwise be left behind.\u201d Ahh yes, privatising Medicare. Welcome back. Is there any policy issue that the business sector doesn\u2019t believe can be solved by privatisation? Especially when that privatisation will most benefit the business run by the person promoting it? There actually has already been a recent quasi-privatising of the health system. The NDIS saw the end of the very good care people received from public health groups such as TherapyACT and a switch to having to find private therapists (often those who had worked for organisations like TherapyACT) who are then paid by through the NDIS. I am sure many have benefited from the NDIS, but I have not found too many benefits that I would not have been as efficiently delivered by just providing the public health sector with the extra money that now goes into the NDIS. But this is the heart of the argument \u2013 the belief that the private sector delivers things better. And yet we know this is a belief better observed in economic textbooks from the 1980s than from reality. The US\u2019s largely privatised health system is inefficient and so disgracefully costly that sickness in the US is almost a synonym for bankruptcy. We know the current government is committed to reducing expenditure and this of course will have to hit the health system. I suspect this will manifest itself in a push for more NDIS style \u201cvoucher systems\u201d which is essentially a privatisation by stealth and for ever-more \u201cincentives\u201d for people to join private health insurance. What is also clear is that the 2016 \u201cMediscare\u201d campaign might have lacked substance but the implicit desire to prefer the private sector over the public sector is a feature of conservative governments either in nations with strong public system like Australia and the UK, or those without like the US. And it is a desire that always needs to be fought against by all of us for whom the public health system is so treasured. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

But the explosion of car traffic in the postwar years persuaded the New South Wales government that urban freeways were the way of the future (the first in Australia, the Cahill Expressway, opened in 1958), and trams were an impediment to that vision.</p> <p>The destruction of the network from the mid-50s was swift and brutal. In 1958 the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Macquarie_Tram_Depot#/media/File:Fort_Macquarie_depot_1940's.jpg\">bizarre castellated Fort Macquarie depot</a> at Circular Quay was demolished to make way for the Opera House, and the lines along George Street were torn up. The last Sydney tram ran on 25 February 1961 from Hunter Street to La Perouse (along much of the same route now being rebuilt), packed to the rafters and greeted by crowds of people, before it joined the dismal procession to \u201cburning hill\u201d at Randwick.</p> <p>The photographer Peter Sage followed its journey to the workshops after the passengers were ordered off at Kensington on the way back from La Perouse. \u201cThe gates closed and the trams were locked away,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe gathered to say farewell and went home by car and bus.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUnRoU81XWI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GUnRoU81XWI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>\u2018A convenient falsehood\u2019</h2> <p>Mathew Hounsell, a senior research consultant at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney, <a href=\"https://innersydneyvoice.org.au/magazine/trams-rebuilding-what-was-lost/\">has called</a> the destruction of the network \u201cthe largest organised vandalism in our nation\u2019s history\u201d.</p> <p>He says the decisions made in the 50s had a disastrous long-term effect. \u201cWhen the trams were removed from Sydney, mass transport patronage plummeted and private car usage soared. Our space-saving trams were replaced with ever-more space-hungry cars, causing ever-worsening traffic.\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t how the planners saw it at the time. They were strongly swayed by powerful international influences, which chimed with the unstoppable rise of private car ownership in Australia.</p> <p>As Graeme Davison relates in his book Car Wars, a succession of Australians studied traffic engineering in the US in the 50s, some under a scholarship sponsored by the Myer family, and brought back an evangelical commitment to urban freeways. And, as one engineer from Los Angeles invited to advise on Melbourne\u2019s traffic future put it: \u201cAll large American cities that were beating traffic tangles were getting rid of trams.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/24/in-praise-of-the-tram-britains-lost-network-and-the-future-of-transport\">In praise of the tram: Britain's lost network and the future of transport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sydney also listened attentively to British experts. In 1949 three representatives of the London Passenger Transport Board recommended to the NSW government that Sydney cancel an order for 250 new trams and replace the entire system with buses by 1960. Three years later Alec Valentine, the president of the British Institute of Transport, came to Sydney and repeated the message.</p> <p>\u201cLondon has resolved its traffic problem by replacing trams with buses, and Sydney should do the same,\u201d he advised.</p> <p>It seems obvious with hindsight that no city\u2019s traffic problem could be \u201cresolved\u201d so easily, but the desire in the postwar years to open up streets to motor vehicles, and particularly the lure of the private car, was intense. A decade of petrol rationing in Australia finally came to an end in 1950, and the recovering economy allowed an unprecedented number of families to think about buying their first car.</p> <p>Besides, the tram network would have needed serious new investment to make up for unavoidable penny-pinching during the war and the early postwar years of austerity, according to David Critchley of the Sydney Tram Museum.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tired system, it was a worn-down system and they kept the system running for quite a while on just the bare minimum,\u201d he says. To many the trams \u201crepresented something that was old and outdated, and they were looking for something new, particularly after the war\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c05280db6bdcab469789d2334f259e7d6d82841f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c05280db6bdcab469789d2334f259e7d6d82841f/0_271_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congested streets in Double Bay in 1960\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congestion in Double Bay in 1960.

As the University of Queensland historian Peter Spearritt <a href=\"https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2014/04/apo-nid213836-1105261.pdf\">has argued</a>, there were a number of reasons for that, including the relative strength of the tramway unions and the \u201cmuch more demure\u201d attitude of the RACV compared with the NRMA in Sydney, which aggressively attacked the tram system.</p> <p>Melbourne being a relatively flat city, with the exceptionally wide streets laid out in colonial times, meant trams were \u201cpretty well adapted to topography\u201d, Davison says.</p> <p>The 50s experts such as Valentine argued that Sydney was particularly unsuitable for trams because of the narrowness of its streets, but Mathew Hounsell calls that \u201ca convenient falsehood\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe streets of Porto, the streets of Istanbul, Prague, many of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram_and_light_rail_transit_systems#World%27s_largest_tram_systems\">cities that are still running trams now</a>, they\u2019re much narrower. Basically, most of the Sydney streets where the trams ran were quite wide \u2013 they were main roads.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed many photos of Sydney\u2019s trams in the 50s, such as those collected in<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/intervene/albums/72157605298170997\"> Lindsay Bridge\u2019s vast archive</a>, show streets outside the city centre with ample room and strikingly sparse traffic by today\u2019s standards. The car boom seemed unstoppable at the time but in 1955 there were only <a href=\"https://chartingtransport.com/2011/08/07/trends-in-car-ownership/\">about 15 cars for every 100 people in Australia</a>, a figure that has since quadrupled.</p> <h2>Destroying the evidence</h2> <p>Some surprisingly large reminders of Sydney\u2019s network can still be seen, such as the tramshed next to Newtown train station, which has somehow survived all-but-untouched for decades. But most of the system was actively destroyed rather than abandoned.</p> <p>In 1949 part of the line from the city to Watsons Bay was closed, only to reopen within a year thanks to well-organised protests from prosperous eastern suburbs residents. To avoid any repetition of those conflicts when the wholesale closure of lines began in 1955, overhead wires were pulled down overnight once the last services had run, and tracks immediately tarred over (the evidence can still be seen in the black strip running down the middle of streets such as Addison Road in Marrickville).</p> <p>\u201cThe department [of government transport] is making sure, no matter how the buses behave, that trams can never run along Pitt and Castlereagh Street again,\u201d a tram driver told the Sun-Herald with some bitterness in November 1957, when that service was closed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"edc2012dd141d44ef7ee8a092352eb2e92e7a55a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edc2012dd141d44ef7ee8a092352eb2e92e7a55a/0_0_2324_1591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The last tram leaves La Perouse for the Randwick workshops in February 1961\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last tram leaves La Perouse for the Randwick workshops in February 1961.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dennis O'Brien</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was a nastiness to it that is quite surprising in hindsight,\u201d Hounsell says. \u201cThere was a clear ideological attack on this particular mode of transport \u2013 an attempt to destroy it and to obliterate it, to erase it from history.\u201d</p> <p>The burning of the trams themselves at Randwick completed the job of removing the evidence, and perhaps removing the memory of a popular system from the consciousness of Sydneysiders.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no room for sentiment,\u201d the city\u2019s licensed tram burner, Oswald \u201cMick\u201d Price, told the Sydney Morning Herald in September 1957. \u201cNot that I enjoy destroying things, mind you. These trams were well built \u2013 still going strong after 40 years\u2019 wear.\u201d</p> <p>David Critchley says the burning of the trams was carried out largely behind closed doors, and attracted little comment. \u201cIn the context of the times, burning things to get rid of them wasn\u2019t an unusual event.\u201d</p> <p>But there were protests on nearly every line as they were marked for closure. Retailers along tramlines were persuaded by the government campaigns that trams were causing congestion, only to find that freeing up space for cars helped destroy local shopping and promote out-of-town supermarkets.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very big con job,\u201d Critchley says. \u201cThey just got convinced by what was going on overseas, what the Americans were doing ...

      "bodyText": "They burnt the trams at Randwick. In the late 1950s Sydney ripped up its tram network, once one of the largest in the world. Nearly 1,000 trams \u2013 some only a few years old \u2013 were rolled to the workshops in the city\u2019s eastern suburbs and stripped of anything that could be sold, before being unceremoniously tipped on their sides, doused with sump oil and set ablaze. Now the trams are returning, as the city painfully rebuilds a tiny part of its old system. The construction of 12.8km of light rail from Circular Quay to Randwick and Kingsford will cost $2.7bn at the latest estimate, has caused untold misery to shops and other businesses in its path and will be almost a year overdue by the time even the first section is open. The new line hardly represents a fundamental shift in Sydney\u2019s transport thinking, coming as it does alongside the vast \u201ccongestion-busting\u201d WestConnex freeway project, and further investment in metro rail (a separate light rail link is also under construction at Parramatta). But it is a reminder that the city might have looked very different today but for the decision taken in the 1950s \u2013 and ruthlessly carried out \u2013 to prioritise motor transport. Barely a decade before its closure, Sydney\u2019s tram system had carried 400 million passenger journeys a year on a network of more than 250km, primarily serving the eastern, southern and inner-west suburbs, and stretching as far north as Narrabeen at its peak. But the explosion of car traffic in the postwar years persuaded the New South Wales government that urban freeways were the way of the future (the first in Australia, the Cahill Expressway, opened in 1958), and trams were an impediment to that vision. The destruction of the network from the mid-50s was swift and brutal. In 1958 the bizarre castellated Fort Macquarie depot at Circular Quay was demolished to make way for the Opera House, and the lines along George Street were torn up. The last Sydney tram ran on 25 February 1961 from Hunter Street to La Perouse (along much of the same route now being rebuilt), packed to the rafters and greeted by crowds of people, before it joined the dismal procession to \u201cburning hill\u201d at Randwick. The photographer Peter Sage followed its journey to the workshops after the passengers were ordered off at Kensington on the way back from La Perouse. \u201cThe gates closed and the trams were locked away,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe gathered to say farewell and went home by car and bus.\u201d \u2018A convenient falsehood\u2019 Mathew Hounsell, a senior research consultant at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney, has called the destruction of the network \u201cthe largest organised vandalism in our nation\u2019s history\u201d. He says the decisions made in the 50s had a disastrous long-term effect. \u201cWhen the trams were removed from Sydney, mass transport patronage plummeted and private car usage soared. Our space-saving trams were replaced with ever-more space-hungry cars, causing ever-worsening traffic.\u201d That wasn\u2019t how the planners saw it at the time. They were strongly swayed by powerful international influences, which chimed with the unstoppable rise of private car ownership in Australia. As Graeme Davison relates in his book Car Wars, a succession of Australians studied traffic engineering in the US in the 50s, some under a scholarship sponsored by the Myer family, and brought back an evangelical commitment to urban freeways. And, as one engineer from Los Angeles invited to advise on Melbourne\u2019s traffic future put it: \u201cAll large American cities that were beating traffic tangles were getting rid of trams.\u201d Sydney also listened attentively to British experts. In 1949 three representatives of the London Passenger Transport Board recommended to the NSW government that Sydney cancel an order for 250 new trams and replace the entire system with buses by 1960. Three years later Alec Valentine, the president of the British Institute of Transport, came to Sydney and repeated the message. \u201cLondon has resolved its traffic problem by replacing trams with buses, and Sydney should do the same,\u201d he advised. It seems obvious with hindsight that no city\u2019s traffic problem could be \u201cresolved\u201d so easily, but the desire in the postwar years to open up streets to motor vehicles, and particularly the lure of the private car, was intense. A decade of petrol rationing in Australia finally came to an end in 1950, and the recovering economy allowed an unprecedented number of families to think about buying their first car. Besides, the tram network would have needed serious new investment to make up for unavoidable penny-pinching during the war and the early postwar years of austerity, according to David Critchley of the Sydney Tram Museum. \u201cIt was a tired system, it was a worn-down system and they kept the system running for quite a while on just the bare minimum,\u201d he says. To many the trams \u201crepresented something that was old and outdated, and they were looking for something new, particularly after the war\u201d. In their history of Sydney trams, Shooting Through, Caroline Butler-Bowdon and Annie Campbell reinforce how that thinking about trams and cars became loaded with symbolism: trams as \u201can embarrassing and sentimental anachronism in the age of speed and streamlined proficiency\u201d and cars as representatives of \u201cmodernity and progress\u201d. But while Sydney joined dozens of other cities around the world in getting rid of its trams, Melbourne somehow bucked the trend. As the University of Queensland historian Peter Spearritt has argued, there were a number of reasons for that, including the relative strength of the tramway unions and the \u201cmuch more demure\u201d attitude of the RACV compared with the NRMA in Sydney, which aggressively attacked the tram system. Melbourne being a relatively flat city, with the exceptionally wide streets laid out in colonial times, meant trams were \u201cpretty well adapted to topography\u201d, Davison says. The 50s experts such as Valentine argued that Sydney was particularly unsuitable for trams because of the narrowness of its streets, but Mathew Hounsell calls that \u201ca convenient falsehood\u201d. \u201cThe streets of Porto, the streets of Istanbul, Prague, many of the cities that are still running trams now, they\u2019re much narrower. Basically, most of the Sydney streets where the trams ran were quite wide \u2013 they were main roads.\u201d Indeed many photos of Sydney\u2019s trams in the 50s, such as those collected in Lindsay Bridge\u2019s vast archive, show streets outside the city centre with ample room and strikingly sparse traffic by today\u2019s standards. The car boom seemed unstoppable at the time but in 1955 there were only about 15 cars for every 100 people in Australia, a figure that has since quadrupled. Destroying the evidence Some surprisingly large reminders of Sydney\u2019s network can still be seen, such as the tramshed next to Newtown train station, which has somehow survived all-but-untouched for decades. But most of the system was actively destroyed rather than abandoned. In 1949 part of the line from the city to Watsons Bay was closed, only to reopen within a year thanks to well-organised protests from prosperous eastern suburbs residents. To avoid any repetition of those conflicts when the wholesale closure of lines began in 1955, overhead wires were pulled down overnight once the last services had run, and tracks immediately tarred over (the evidence can still be seen in the black strip running down the middle of streets such as Addison Road in Marrickville). \u201cThe department [of government transport] is making sure, no matter how the buses behave, that trams can never run along Pitt and Castlereagh Street again,\u201d a tram driver told the Sun-Herald with some bitterness in November 1957, when that service was closed. \u201cThere was a nastiness to it that is quite surprising in hindsight,\u201d Hounsell says. \u201cThere was a clear ideological attack on this particular mode of transport \u2013 an attempt to destroy it and to obliterate it, to erase it from history.\u201d The burning of the trams themselves at Randwick completed the job of removing the evidence, and perhaps removing the memory of a popular system from the consciousness of Sydneysiders. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for sentiment,\u201d the city\u2019s licensed tram burner, Oswald \u201cMick\u201d Price, told the Sydney Morning Herald in September 1957. \u201cNot that I enjoy destroying things, mind you. These trams were well built \u2013 still going strong after 40 years\u2019 wear.\u201d David Critchley says the burning of the trams was carried out largely behind closed doors, and attracted little comment. \u201cIn the context of the times, burning things to get rid of them wasn\u2019t an unusual event.\u201d But there were protests on nearly every line as they were marked for closure. Retailers along tramlines were persuaded by the government campaigns that trams were causing congestion, only to find that freeing up space for cars helped destroy local shopping and promote out-of-town supermarkets. \u201cIt was a very big con job,\u201d Critchley says. \u201cThey just got convinced by what was going on overseas, what the Americans were doing ... It was the wrong decision. I think we\u2019ve always regretted that.\u201d",

But Trump has had his own problems with rodents. For example, in February, the Trump Tower Grille in the president\u2019s signature Manhattan property was reported for \u201clive mice\u201d and other health code violations. New York City health inspectors visited the restaurant on 11 July 2018 and found \u201cevidence of mice or live mice\u201d in and around the kitchen, a violation of sanitary standards that was deemed to be \u201ccritical\u201d. The inspectors also found the restaurant to be \u201cnot vermin-proof\u201d and said it was \u201cconducive to attracting vermin\u201d and \u201callowing vermin to exist\u201d. The New York Daily News reported that the Trump Tower restaurant has been cited for health code violations in each of the past five years, including sightings of \u201clive roaches\u201d in 2016 and \u201cfilth flies\u201d in 2017. A Trump Organization spokesman told the paper such infractions had been dealt with and the restaurant retained an A rating from the city health department. But a former business associate told the Daily News that despite being a self-described \u201cclean hands freak\u201d and germaphobe, Trump has \u201calways been far more focused on creating an image for his properties than in spending what it takes to make them excellent\u201d. The president\u2019s Trump Golf Links in the Bronx has also had problems with health inspections. The course restaurant\u2019s plumbing and sewage systems were deemed substandard, the Daily News reported. Rats have also been involved in anti-Trump protests.

A card attached to a bunch of flowers left recently said: \u201cThank you, Duce\u201d.</p> <p>The Gamberinis are now thrilled to learn that they might again be able to pay their respects on any day of the year after the town\u2019s recently elected rightwing mayor, Roberto Canali, last week announced controversial plans to reopen the crypt all year round as a way to boost tourism.</p> <p>Most residents in this town of about 6,000 accept the influx of fascists on the anniversaries as a necessary evil as they are the most fruitful days of the year for shops, bars and hotels, hence the reason why there has been little criticism locally of Canali\u2019s plans.</p> <p>In fact his pledge, which has been supported by Mussolini\u2019s granddaughters, Rachele and Alessandra, was an election campaign winner.</p> <p>\u201cAfter the tomb was closed, so many businesses complained about the loss of custom,\u201d Canali told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cApart from those three intense days a year, we get a continuous flow of people who, dressed normally, come out of curiosity or to understand history, but who are disappointed to find the tomb closed.\u201d</p> <p>Claudia Brunazzi, a representative from the local business association, Albero Rosso, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that Predappio is only remembered for this, as there is so much more \u2013 the wine, food, scenery \u2013 but ... opening the tomb is useful for business.\u201d</p> <p>Needless to say, Canali\u2019s plans triggered a sharp rebuke from Italy\u2019s anti-fascist association, ANPI, which is planning to protest on Sunday (the day the crypt will be open).</p> <p>\u201cThis muddies the memories of the many victims of fascist crime, its racial laws and collaboration with the Nazis that led to the massacre of innocent women, men and children,\u201d the association said in a statement.</p> <p>Luca Capacci, a spokesperson for Possibile, a small leftwing party, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very sad and worrying that the opening of the tomb is seen as an attractive element in a territory that has much more to offer. It\u2019s not a historic monument like the Colosseum \u2026 the people who go there do so to celebrate a dictator.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d712220c7bea8ae3de20cbc08f57496e31cdc82c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d712220c7bea8ae3de20cbc08f57496e31cdc82c/0_525_5229_3138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The coffin containing the remains of Mussolini is moved to the crypt in Predappio in 1957.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The coffin containing the remains of Mussolini is moved to the crypt in Predappio in 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is unclear when the tomb, whose opening to the public is at the behest of the Mussolini family, would be opened permanently, as town leaders still need to work out who will foot the \u20ac30,000-a-year bill for it to be guarded and maintained \u2013 the town or the family.

      "bodyText": "Dressed in black T-shirts, their arms inked with tattoos, Fabrizio and Mameli Gamberini are on their yearly homage trip to Predappio, the birth town and burial place of Benito Mussolini. \u201cWe\u2019re fascists,\u201d Mameli proudly admits as she leaves Predappio Tricolore, a souvenir shop teeming with Mussolini memorabilia, on Friday morning. \u201cWe come every year at the end of July to buy a few new keepsakes, visit his tomb and leave some flowers in his honour.\u201d The couple, from Varese, are in Predappio, a town nestled among the hills of the Appenines in the Emilia-Romagna region, to celebrate the 136th anniversary of the Italian dictator\u2019s birth on 29 July. It is one of three occasions over the past two years, including the anniversary of his death on 28 April and the march on Rome on 28 October, that the Mussolini family crypt has been opened to the public since it was closed for restoration works in 2017. The anniversaries have always attracted thousands of fascist pilgrims from across Italy and beyond, who join a parade that leads to the tiny San Cassiano cemetery, where they pay tribute to Il Duce (The Leader) with a fascist salute, leaving messages of admiration in the guest book. A card attached to a bunch of flowers left recently said: \u201cThank you, Duce\u201d. The Gamberinis are now thrilled to learn that they might again be able to pay their respects on any day of the year after the town\u2019s recently elected rightwing mayor, Roberto Canali, last week announced controversial plans to reopen the crypt all year round as a way to boost tourism. Most residents in this town of about 6,000 accept the influx of fascists on the anniversaries as a necessary evil as they are the most fruitful days of the year for shops, bars and hotels, hence the reason why there has been little criticism locally of Canali\u2019s plans. In fact his pledge, which has been supported by Mussolini\u2019s granddaughters, Rachele and Alessandra, was an election campaign winner. \u201cAfter the tomb was closed, so many businesses complained about the loss of custom,\u201d Canali told the Observer. \u201cApart from those three intense days a year, we get a continuous flow of people who, dressed normally, come out of curiosity or to understand history, but who are disappointed to find the tomb closed.\u201d Claudia Brunazzi, a representative from the local business association, Albero Rosso, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that Predappio is only remembered for this, as there is so much more \u2013 the wine, food, scenery \u2013 but ... opening the tomb is useful for business.\u201d Needless to say, Canali\u2019s plans triggered a sharp rebuke from Italy\u2019s anti-fascist association, ANPI, which is planning to protest on Sunday (the day the crypt will be open). \u201cThis muddies the memories of the many victims of fascist crime, its racial laws and collaboration with the Nazis that led to the massacre of innocent women, men and children,\u201d the association said in a statement. Luca Capacci, a spokesperson for Possibile, a small leftwing party, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very sad and worrying that the opening of the tomb is seen as an attractive element in a territory that has much more to offer. It\u2019s not a historic monument like the Colosseum \u2026 the people who go there do so to celebrate a dictator.\u201d It is unclear when the tomb, whose opening to the public is at the behest of the Mussolini family, would be opened permanently, as town leaders still need to work out who will foot the \u20ac30,000-a-year bill for it to be guarded and maintained \u2013 the town or the family. One of the reasons it hasn\u2019t been reopened since restoration works was because the previous custodian, a devout Mussolini fan, did the job for free for years. Nostalgic factions of the Italian population have long helped keep the spirit of Mussolini alive, but thriving rightwing populism has been further dismantling the taboo.

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives are experiencing a \u201cBoris bounce\u201d in the polls since his appointment as prime minister. In Boris Johnson\u2019s first week in Downing Street, the Tories led with 30% of the vote. New polling by Opinium for The Observer shows the Tories enjoying a two-point lead over Labour \u2013 a gain of seven points \u2013 in the past fortnight. The polling, carried out after Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership victory, shows the Conservatives benefitting from a surge in support away from The Brexit party. Despite being pushed into second place, Labour are also up three points to 28% at the expense of the Green Party. While support for Labour has grown, their leader Jeremy Corbyn is seen as a weaker leader than Boris Johnson: 38% of those polled believed Johnson had stronger leadership credentials compared to 17 % for Corbyn \u2013 a 21 point lead. Not since the 2017 election, when Theresa May led the party, has a Tory leader enjoyed such a comfortable margin. The only advantage that Corbyn holds is that he is perceived to be \u201cmore in touch\u201d with ordinary people than Johnson. Adam Drummond, senior research manager at Opinium, said the first poll of Johnson\u2019s premiership showed that the Tories plan to unite the Leave vote against divided opposition was working. Among Leave voters, he said support for the Tories was up 12 points, at the expense of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. \u201cIn 2017 the Tory strategy failed in part because of a poor campaign by Theresa May but also because non-Tories united behind Labour to prevent a Tory landslide. \u201cThis time both party leaders are much more well known than their equivalents were in 2017, so the chances of a late surge are more remote.

The latest poll shows that 25% of the public say they are more likely to vote for the Conservative party now Johnson leads it, with 19% saying they are less likely to. Even more positively for the Conservatives, almost half of Brexit Party voters (47%) say they would now be more likely to support the Tories. However Johnson is seen as a divisive figure, with half (50%) believing he will divide the country. A smaller number (31%) think he will unite it According to Opinium\u2019s polling, some 45% of the public think the UK should go ahead with Brexit irrespective of whether he can agree a better deal. But a similar proportion (41%) think Brexit should be delayed or cancelled altogether. If the prime minister is unsuccessful in negotiating changes to the EU withdrawal agreement and parliament forces the government to seek a further extension, 57% believe a fresh general election should called. Opinium\u2019s polling was carried out between 24 and 26 July.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s appointment of a cabinet dominated by hardline Brexiters suggests he will adopt an uncompromising approach to Brexit, one that will be hard to deliver given the current composition of the House of Commons. But what if the goal is to change the Commons arithmetic via an early election? Could a \u201cdelivering Brexit\u201d campaign win him a parliamentary majority and, if so, where would he need to win and what would the risks be?</p> <p>The balance of power in the polls is far more fragmented now than when Theresa May called an early election in June 2017. Both the Conservatives and Labour have fallen sharply and now find themselves in a four-way competition with the Brexit party, which rose to 20% support within months of its foundation, and the Liberal Democrats, whose anti-Brexit stance has become more popular as opinion has polarised. The Greens, another strongly anti-Brexit party, have also gained substantial ground.</p> <p>The adoption of an uncompromising approach to Brexit suggests Johnson\u2019s strategy is to consolidate support from Leave voters by squeezing the newcomer Brexit party as much as possible, while hoping that the Remain vote remains divided.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The first problem is that an uncompromising hard Brexit strategy puts quite a lot of Conservative seats at risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The British electoral system rewards only the party that comes first, so Johnson can gain a majority even on a much lower overall share of the vote than May, provided his opponents fall back more and geography breaks his way. It is easy to see how a Conservative consolidation of the Leave vote could help deliver strongly Leave-backing Labour marginals, particularly if competition from the Brexit party eats into the local Labour vote. But a divided Remain vote could also offer openings in strongly Remain areas.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s appointment of a cabinet dominated by hardline Brexiters suggests he will adopt an uncompromising approach to Brexit, one that will be hard to deliver given the current composition of the House of Commons. But what if the goal is to change the Commons arithmetic via an early election? Could a \u201cdelivering Brexit\u201d campaign win him a parliamentary majority and, if so, where would he need to win and what would the risks be? The balance of power in the polls is far more fragmented now than when Theresa May called an early election in June 2017. Both the Conservatives and Labour have fallen sharply and now find themselves in a four-way competition with the Brexit party, which rose to 20% support within months of its foundation, and the Liberal Democrats, whose anti-Brexit stance has become more popular as opinion has polarised. The Greens, another strongly anti-Brexit party, have also gained substantial ground. The adoption of an uncompromising approach to Brexit suggests Johnson\u2019s strategy is to consolidate support from Leave voters by squeezing the newcomer Brexit party as much as possible, while hoping that the Remain vote remains divided. The British electoral system rewards only the party that comes first, so Johnson can gain a majority even on a much lower overall share of the vote than May, provided his opponents fall back more and geography breaks his way. It is easy to see how a Conservative consolidation of the Leave vote could help deliver strongly Leave-backing Labour marginals, particularly if competition from the Brexit party eats into the local Labour vote. But a divided Remain vote could also offer openings in strongly Remain areas. If disaffected Labour Remainers defect to the Liberal Democrats in large numbers, the Conservatives could gain these seats even while going backwards substantially themselves. The logic of such a strategy is fairly clear \u2013 under first past the post, a consolidated Leave vote will overcome a fragmented Remain vote often enough to deliver the Conservatives victory in many seats and thus a majority overall. A similar dynamic \u2013 consolidating the independence vote while the unionist vote split in multiple directions \u2013 enabled the SNP to turn 50% of the vote into 95% of the seats in Scotland in 2015.

      "bodyText": "Millions of grasshoppers have descended on Las Vegas, causing alarming images and videos to spread on social media and prompting some tourists to panic. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d one tourist, Diana Rodriquez, told the TV station KLAS. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even want to walk through there. Everybody was going crazy. We were wondering, like, what\u2019s going on.\u201d Fortunately, the Nevada state entomologist Jeff Knight was on hand to explain. He told reporters the migration of adult pallid-winged grasshoppers traveling north to central Nevada could be attributed to wet weather several months ago. The swarms were unusual but not unprecedented and posed no danger to humans, Knight said, adding that the insects did not carry disease, did not bite and probably would not damage any property before they disappear in several weeks\u2019 time. The grasshoppers are usually attracted to ultraviolet light sources, Knight said. The garish Las Vegas Strip and the city\u2019s many giant casinos have plenty of those. Knight recalled several similar migrations in his more than 30 years at the state department of agriculture, including one about six or seven years ago. Nancy Ryan, a Vegas comedian whose husband took a particularly striking video of the insects, told the New York Times she thought \u201cmost locals are taking it in [their] stride because this occurs every few years. Since there\u2019s more than usual, I think the dramatic videos are causing a bit of hysteria.\u201d This year, the Las Vegas area recorded more rain in six months than the annual average of just under 4.2in per year.",

      "bodyText": "A judge in New York has granted a request from prosecutors to keep secret documents relating to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s controversial 2008 sexual abuse plea deal, on the grounds that the materials could hamper their investigation of others in the financier\u2019s milieu. The documents, which will be shared with Epstein\u2019s attorneys, are believed to concern not only the deal itself, which allowed Epstein to plead guilty to low-level state solicitation charges, but also a clause that granted immunity to any and all potential co-conspirators and named four women suspected of facilitating or participating in alleged crimes against minors. The documents may also shed light on the 2008 deal, which was kept secret from accusers for nearly a year in what some claim was a violation of the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act. Controversy over the deal forced the resignation earlier this month of the US labor secretary, Alex Acosta, who was US attorney in Miami at the time. In a court filing, prosecutors with the southern district of New York argued that the materials could \u201caffect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals \u2026 [and that] would impede, if prematurely disclosed, the government\u2019s ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals\u201d. The order is only one of several signals that prosecutors plan to widen their investigation into what they allege was a years-long scheme to recruit and sexually abuse dozens of girls. Epstein, denied bail and remaining in custody pending trial, has pleaded not guilty to federal sex-trafficking charges. He is on suicide watch in a Manhattan detention facility, after being found unconscious with marks on his neck. On Friday, it was revealed that pilots of Epstein\u2019s private jets, including a Boeing 727 that carried high-profile friends to and from his home in the Virgin Islands, have been served with subpoenas. According to court filings, the pilots were responsible for keeping flight logs of passengers on the jets. Their testimony could be used by prosecutors to corroborate accusers\u2019 accounts and provide details of Epstein associates. Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, who was named in a civil suit brought by Epstein accuser Victoria Giuffre in 2003, are regularly named among associates of Epstein. Clinton has denied flying with the financier as many as 26 times, as has been reported, although he did say he took \u201ca total of four trips\u201d with him in 2002 and 2003. In a statement, the former president said he \u201cknows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York\u201d. Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the accusations against Prince Andrew. In 2015, Giuffre brought a defamation suit against Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, for publicly calling Giuffre a liar after she claimed Maxwell participated with Epstein in sexually abusing her for two years starting in 2000, when she was 16 years old. This month, Maxwell, who has long denied allegations that she played a central role in the procuring of young women, told a three-judge panel in New York a media \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d justified keeping documents from the defamation suit secret. But Josh Schiller, one of Giuffre\u2019s lawyers, argued: \u201cThere is an overwhelming public interest both in getting access to these documents as well as the indictment of Mr Epstein and his prosecution.\u201d The judicial panel agreed. As soon as next week, 2,000 pages of documents relating to that case, which was settled in 2017, will be made public. In its ruling, the panel said the documents included descriptions of alleged abuse by Epstein and other individuals \u201cincluding numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders\u201d. In April, Giuffre filed a defamation suit against the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Epstein\u2019s longtime lawyer and friend, after he denied her claim that he abused her. The shockwaves from Epstein\u2019s arrest on 6 July could travel further still. Central to the mystery of his operations is how he acquired his wealth, which was listed at his bail hearing as more than $550m. Last week, Deutsche Bank confirmed that Epstein moved millions of dollars through dozens of private accounts. Executives said they had believed they had severed the relationship with Epstein but had discovered accounts still controlled by him as recently as June. \u201cDeutsche Bank is closely examining any business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and we are absolutely committed to cooperating with all relevant authorities,\u201d a spokesman said. Authorities in Florida, meanwhile, have launched an investigation into whether Epstein was properly monitored during the 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution from underage girls that was the product of the controversial 2008 deal.",

Both Quintana and Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n, runner-up to Froome in the 2017 Tour and second overall in the Giro in 2013 and 2014, have A-list status in Colombia. Such is Ur\u00e1n\u2019s standing back home that during Brailsford\u2019s search for a sponsor, the 32 year old finessed a meeting for his former team manager with his nation\u2019s president. At the start of this year, Brailsford returned fired up and enthused about the possibilities for Latin American cycling after his latest visit to Colombia. Bernal\u2019s victory has kicked down a door that was already slightly ajar and that now opens up new territories for cycling, both in commercial and sporting terms. Bernal spearheads Brailsford\u2019s youth policy, which also includes riders such as Tao Geoghegan Hart, Tom Pidcock, Pavel Sivakov, Eddie Dunbar and Iv\u00e1n Sosa, also Colombian. Meanwhile, the scramble to sign other young Colombians is gathering pace, with Sergio Higuita, snapped up recently by Vaughters for his Education First team, tipped for success. If Brailsford, his staff and his riders are to be praised for their resilience during a Tour dogged by crashes and ill-discipline through Luke Rowe\u2019s disqualification, then there is little doubt that Bernal\u2019s win ushers in a changing of the guard for the British team, with both Thomas and the injured Froome now entering the twilight of their careers. The outgoing champion maintains he is not finished yet, which might make next year\u2019s Ineos team a little top heavy. Asked if he can win another Tour, Thomas said: \u201cI think so. A lot of people probably don\u2019t but that spurs me on. It\u2019s disappointing that I didn\u2019t win my second but it\u2019s not about me today, it\u2019s all about Egan. It was an incredible performance from him.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When 71-year-old Nick Fraser first encountered documentaries in the 1960s, he admits he found them \u201cnot very interesting\u201d. That changed, partly because of a cultural shift \u2013 Fraser cites DA Pennebaker in the US and Nick Broomfield here as pioneers \u2013 and Fraser played his own part as well. From the late 1990s, for 17 years, he was editor of the BBC strand Storyville and worked on films such as <em>Man on Wire</em> and <em>One Day in September</em>, which both won Oscars. Fraser\u2019s new book, <em>Say What Happened: A Story of Documentaries</em>, traces the history of documentary film-making.</p> <p>Shortly after finishing the first draft, Fraser was giving a talk in London and had just shown a clip of one of his favourite Storyville docs, the 2007 film <em>The English Surgeon</em><em>,</em> about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/henry-marsh\" title=\"\">British neurologist Henry Marsh</a>, when he had to sit down; his thinking was muddled, he couldn\u2019t speak. Fraser had, extraordinarily, had a stroke just as he was talking about the otherworldly impact of brain injuries. The book was finished in his recovery, which is going well. He lives in west London and is creative director of the documentary streaming service and production house <a href=\"https://www.docsville.com/\" title=\"\">Docsville</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>Say What Happened</strong></em><strong> suggests that documentaries are more important than ever. Why is that?</strong><br>People don\u2019t really read newspapers, alas. They do read the <em>Guardian</em> or the <em>New York Times</em> online, but I think a lot of important issues are discovered through documentaries. People like Alex Gibney, and a lot of directors in Britain as well, are covering huge issues through their films. In a way, a really good documentary is more powerful than most written pieces. I found this out quickly after a few years in journalism. I always read papers and nonfiction, but really good documentaries have more punch and power than journalism. If you get the right audiences, they\u2019ll remember the subject and they can change the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Storyville budget has gone from \u00a32m a year to \u00a31m, which is pathetic when you think about the impact of these films</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What\u2019s a good example of the impact documentaries can have?</strong><br><em>India\u2019s Daughter</em>, a film I did with the BBC, was viewed all over the world, and in India millions of people watched it. It had a huge effect in bringing to light <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/03/five-years-after-gang-murder-jyoti-singh-how-has-delhi-changed\" title=\"\">the issue of rape in India</a>. Another example is [the 1990 documentary] <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jan/29/sundance-2015-paris-is-burning-restored-jennie-livingston\" title=\"\">Paris Is Burning</a></em>: it\u2019s about gay balls in Harlem and New York. Many of the people died of Aids, but you watch it and in two hours you understand a bit more about their lives.</p> <p><strong>How did you work on the book after your stroke?</strong><br>The plan was to deliver it in spring 2017, but I had to stop for about eight months after the stroke that February. I had to learn to read and write properly again. My colleague India Woods helped me finish the draft after the stroke \u2013 it was really quite difficult. Also, I wanted to include in the book the films that I started watching about hospitals \u2013 which I suddenly understood well.</p> <p><strong>What do you recall of the stroke?</strong><br>It\u2019s really weird. You don\u2019t really have any concept of who you are or where you are. You are in the hospital and you can read, but you can\u2019t really understand. And my poor family: my poor wife and daughter, I was so exhausting every day. Some of the bits of your brain have disappeared; but then it gets better, somehow your brain works slightly better.</p> <p><strong>Reading was a big part of your rehab. Did it feel like you were learning from scratch?</strong><br>It was quite difficult so I reread George Orwell and John le Carr\u00e9 \u2013 they write very well, and they write very simple ideas. Also, I read a lot of the <em>Guardian</em> and the <em>Times</em>. I was obsessed with being able to write and read again. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoGtGv2KS48\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JoGtGv2KS48?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoGtGv2KS48\">Watch a trailer for the Storyville documentary India\u2019s Daughter.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Which of your own documentary projects and commissions are you especially proud of?</strong><br><em>Man on Wire</em> [which follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2015/oct/01/philippe-petit-walk-between-twin-towers\" title=\"\">Philippe Petit\u2019s 1974 high-wire walk</a> between the twin towers of New York\u2019s World Trade Center] was so easy, because James Marsh writes films perfectly.He knew exactly what he wanted to do and the film was wonderful. I was amazed that people cried at Sundance when they watched it. I think it was because of the image of New York, which has now been lost. The disaster of 9/11 has been one of the most sad, awful things about our era.</p> <p><em>The English Surgeon,</em> also, was special. Henry Marsh is a very English person: he is like Alec Guinness, the Man in the White Suit. And Marsh is a magician: he is able to help people\u2019s brains that have been damaged.</p> <p><strong>You left the BBC in </strong><strong>2016</strong><strong> after 17 years \u2013 why</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I\u2019d done it for almost 20 years and I had this friend who wanted to do streaming with Docsville, and I was interested in that. It is an astonishing place, the BBC, but it has its own culture. In the past, the BBC had a really internationalist idea of the world. At the moment, this is disappearing. It\u2019s always a problem about money, and the BBC\u2019s own worries about its prestige. The cost of one programme on the BBC is equivalent to the budget of Storyville for one year. Documentaries all over the world are so important. The [Storyville] budget has gone from \u00a32m a year down to \u00a31m, which is so pathetic when you think about the impact and enduring legacy of these films.</p> <p><strong>What have you watched recently that you enjoyed?</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/chernobyl\" title=\"\">Chernobyl</a></em>\u2019s a masterpiece. I loved <em>Fleabag</em><em>. </em>I thought it was astonishingly funny and as good as Shakespeare \u2013 in fact, his comedies aren\u2019t as funny as Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing.

      "bodyText": "When 71-year-old Nick Fraser first encountered documentaries in the 1960s, he admits he found them \u201cnot very interesting\u201d. That changed, partly because of a cultural shift \u2013 Fraser cites DA Pennebaker in the US and Nick Broomfield here as pioneers \u2013 and Fraser played his own part as well. From the late 1990s, for 17 years, he was editor of the BBC strand Storyville and worked on films such as Man on Wire and One Day in September, which both won Oscars. Fraser\u2019s new book, Say What Happened: A Story of Documentaries, traces the history of documentary film-making. Shortly after finishing the first draft, Fraser was giving a talk in London and had just shown a clip of one of his favourite Storyville docs, the 2007 film The English Surgeon, about the British neurologist Henry Marsh, when he had to sit down; his thinking was muddled, he couldn\u2019t speak. Fraser had, extraordinarily, had a stroke just as he was talking about the otherworldly impact of brain injuries. The book was finished in his recovery, which is going well. He lives in west London and is creative director of the documentary streaming service and production house Docsville. Say What Happened suggests that documentaries are more important than ever. Why is that? People don\u2019t really read newspapers, alas. They do read the Guardian or the New York Times online, but I think a lot of important issues are discovered through documentaries. People like Alex Gibney, and a lot of directors in Britain as well, are covering huge issues through their films. In a way, a really good documentary is more powerful than most written pieces. I found this out quickly after a few years in journalism. I always read papers and nonfiction, but really good documentaries have more punch and power than journalism. If you get the right audiences, they\u2019ll remember the subject and they can change the world. What\u2019s a good example of the impact documentaries can have? India\u2019s Daughter, a film I did with the BBC, was viewed all over the world, and in India millions of people watched it. It had a huge effect in bringing to light the issue of rape in India. Another example is [the 1990 documentary] Paris Is Burning: it\u2019s about gay balls in Harlem and New York. Many of the people died of Aids, but you watch it and in two hours you understand a bit more about their lives. How did you work on the book after your stroke? The plan was to deliver it in spring 2017, but I had to stop for about eight months after the stroke that February. I had to learn to read and write properly again. My colleague India Woods helped me finish the draft after the stroke \u2013 it was really quite difficult. Also, I wanted to include in the book the films that I started watching about hospitals \u2013 which I suddenly understood well. What do you recall of the stroke? It\u2019s really weird. You don\u2019t really have any concept of who you are or where you are. You are in the hospital and you can read, but you can\u2019t really understand. And my poor family: my poor wife and daughter, I was so exhausting every day. Some of the bits of your brain have disappeared; but then it gets better, somehow your brain works slightly better. Reading was a big part of your rehab. Did it feel like you were learning from scratch? It was quite difficult so I reread George Orwell and John le Carr\u00e9 \u2013 they write very well, and they write very simple ideas. Also, I read a lot of the Guardian and the Times. I was obsessed with being able to write and read again. Which of your own documentary projects and commissions are you especially proud of? Man on Wire [which follows Philippe Petit\u2019s 1974 high-wire walk between the twin towers of New York\u2019s World Trade Center] was so easy, because James Marsh writes films perfectly.He knew exactly what he wanted to do and the film was wonderful. I was amazed that people cried at Sundance when they watched it. I think it was because of the image of New York, which has now been lost. The disaster of 9/11 has been one of the most sad, awful things about our era. The English Surgeon, also, was special. Henry Marsh is a very English person: he is like Alec Guinness, the Man in the White Suit. And Marsh is a magician: he is able to help people\u2019s brains that have been damaged. You left the BBC in 2016 after 17 years \u2013 why? I\u2019d done it for almost 20 years and I had this friend who wanted to do streaming with Docsville, and I was interested in that. It is an astonishing place, the BBC, but it has its own culture. In the past, the BBC had a really internationalist idea of the world. At the moment, this is disappearing. It\u2019s always a problem about money, and the BBC\u2019s own worries about its prestige. The cost of one programme on the BBC is equivalent to the budget of Storyville for one year. Documentaries all over the world are so important. The [Storyville] budget has gone from \u00a32m a year down to \u00a31m, which is so pathetic when you think about the impact and enduring legacy of these films. What have you watched recently that you enjoyed? Chernobyl\u2019s a masterpiece. I loved Fleabag. I thought it was astonishingly funny and as good as Shakespeare \u2013 in fact, his comedies aren\u2019t as funny as Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing. And yesterday I watched Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\u2019s new film, Never Look Away, which is amazing. Subtitles are actually very helpful to me. I\u2019m really bad with radio. If people talk for five minutes or 10 minutes on the radio, I can\u2019t understand what they are talking about. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get better, but I can still get on with film. What\u2019s on your bedside table? Robert Macfarlane\u2019s book on tunnels, Underland. What a crazy idea. Partly I thought: you could make a really good film about it. What\u2019s the last really great book you read? That\u2019s terribly difficult. It\u2019s so boring to say Life and Fate, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just the best book ever.

When I was in hospital, a friend gave me the graphic novel Maus, by Art Spiegelman. That\u2019s remarkable. What book did you last put down without finishing? I\u2019ve never finished Ulysses; I thought it was too boring. \u2022 Say What Happened: A Story of Documentaries by Nick Fraser is published by Faber (\u00a320).

Tuesday My hotel has a pool, and after six hours working in a sweltering gymnasium on the N\u00eemes Peripherique, the cool, blue waters beckon. But it also has a significant crew of the chiselled kids from the race\u2019s publicity caravan camped out in the loungers and dive-bombing each other, making it look like the Tour\u2019s equivalent of Love Island. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, I reluctantly turn on my heel and opt for iced ros\u00e9 instead. Wednesday The sun hammers down on the start village at Pont du Gard, a stone\u2019s throw from the village renowned as the hottest place in France. A digital display at a local chemist reads 43 degrees and the mountain of drained single-use plastic rolling around on the back seat of the car grows by the hour. At the finish line in Gap, there\u2019s a welcome breath of fresh air, but as the peloton wilts on the hills of the Vaucluse and Drome, tempers fray and Luke Rowe and Tony Martin are given straight reds. Thursday The weather is changing and so, it seems, is the race. Julian Alaphilippe is finally reaching his limits near the top of the Galibier climb, as Bernal and Thomas lead the accelerations over the summit. Perhaps this is where the dream ends and French cycling resumes its normal status as also-rans. But non \u2013 \u2018Super\u2019 Julian flies down the mountain, narrowly avoiding ending up in the kitchenettes of camper vans and motorhomes, and then reels his rivals in, as if they\u2019re overladen cyclo-tourists pootling their way to a camp site. Friday D-Day for the Tour de France\u2019s crowded overall classification. Finally, Bernal shows his true colours, leaving the other contenders for dead on the huge ascent of the Iseran. But as soon as he crests the summit, the race is over as landslides flow across the route, making it impassable. Saturday Thibaut Pinot is back at home and Alaphilippe is no longer in yellow. The peloton race on to Val Thorens, more out of duty than expectation. What happened to the sky-scraping, cliffhanging finale of the \u2018highest Tour in history\u2019?",

The job spec for it depends on the particular dynamics of the team at that moment and the whims and preferences of the captain and coach. England have had three of the vice-captains in their Test team in the past 18 months: James Anderson, Jos Buttler, and, now, for the second-time around, Ben Stokes, who lost the job in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/14/ben-stokes-trial-cleared-affray-brawl-outside-bristol-nightclub-england-cricketer\" title=\"\">fall out from that brawl in Bristol</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/27/ben-stokes-jofra-archer-england-ashes-squad-first-test\">Ben Stokes named vice-captain as Jofra Archer makes England\u2019s Ashes squad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Anderson had it because he was the senior man and a steady pair of hands at a time when the team was in crisis; Buttler because he is the brightest of the young batsmen and the man most likely to take over the captaincy of the one-day team when Eoin Morgan retires; and Stokes because he is a talismanic player, \u201cthe real heartbeat of the team\u201d was how Ricky Ponting put it this week and compared Stokes to Andrew Flintoff: \u201cThe guy they go to whenever they\u2019re in trouble and they need something; the guy Australia need to keep quiet if we\u2019re going to win the series.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now he is back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/27/ben-stokes-jofra-archer-england-ashes-squad-first-test\" title=\"\">acting as Joe Root\u2019s right-hand man for the Ashes</a>, with the explicit backing of every last member of ECB\u2019s hierarchy, from the kitman up. England\u2019s press release made a point of mentioning that the appointment had been endorsed by the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, the chief executive, Tom Harrison, and the chairman, Colin Graves.

At the same time, his batting average has fallen from 36 to 29 in Tests, but risen from 35 to 54 in ODIs.</p> \n<p>He is a slower, steadier batsman now; less threatening in attack, perhaps, but more formidable in defence. He has become a player who will turn his hand to whatever the team need him to do.

      "bodyText": "No one writes books about how to be the best second-in-charge, there is not an entry on it in the MCC manual or a chapter in Don Bradman\u2019s The Art of Cricket and Mike Brearley never penned The Art of Vice-Captaincy. The job spec for it depends on the particular dynamics of the team at that moment and the whims and preferences of the captain and coach. England have had three of the vice-captains in their Test team in the past 18 months: James Anderson, Jos Buttler, and, now, for the second-time around, Ben Stokes, who lost the job in the fall out from that brawl in Bristol. Anderson had it because he was the senior man and a steady pair of hands at a time when the team was in crisis; Buttler because he is the brightest of the young batsmen and the man most likely to take over the captaincy of the one-day team when Eoin Morgan retires; and Stokes because he is a talismanic player, \u201cthe real heartbeat of the team\u201d was how Ricky Ponting put it this week and compared Stokes to Andrew Flintoff: \u201cThe guy they go to whenever they\u2019re in trouble and they need something; the guy Australia need to keep quiet if we\u2019re going to win the series.\u201d Now he is back acting as Joe Root\u2019s right-hand man for the Ashes, with the explicit backing of every last member of ECB\u2019s hierarchy, from the kitman up. England\u2019s press release made a point of mentioning that the appointment had been endorsed by the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, the chief executive, Tom Harrison, and the chairman, Colin Graves. All Stokes needed to do was win them a World Cup. However, this promotion is less about rehabilitating Stokes than it is about acknowledging how much responsibility he has taken on for holding together this fragile England team. Like Ponting said: \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s playing with a lot of maturity; he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s in much of a rush now as he might have been.\u201d If you split his career into what happened before and after he was dropped by England, you can see the change reflected in his statistics. Beforehand, Stokes had a batting strike rate of 64 in Test cricket and 98 in the one-day game; since he has come back, he has a strike rate of 46 in Test cricket and 87 in one\u2011day cricket. At the same time, his batting average has fallen from 36 to 29 in Tests, but risen from 35 to 54 in ODIs. He is a slower, steadier batsman now; less threatening in attack, perhaps, but more formidable in defence. He has become a player who will turn his hand to whatever the team need him to do. Whether it is the 89 from 115 balls in that defeat against Australia in the group stages of the World Cup, when he came in with the score 26 for three in the sixth over. Or the 79 from 54 he clobbered in their very next game against India, his innings beginning when they were 207 for three in the 34th. Or even the eight off three balls he scored in the Super Over at the end of the final a week later. You can see that flexibility in his bowling too, where he has learned to take on very different roles for England\u2019s Test and one-day teams. When he is playing with a white ball, Stokes tries to dry up the runs. Among the 71 fast bowlers who played in this World Cup, only three of them bowled as many cheap overs as Stokes did. He got through 50.5 at an economy rate of 4.83 each. Amazingly, he was not hit for a single six in the tournament, which is some turnaround for a man who once got walloped for four sixes in four consecutive balls in the last over of the World T20 final. Upshot is, he is taking fewer wickets with a white ball than he used to. But in Test cricket, where he his role is to make breakthroughs, his bowling is more penetrative than ever. He has taken 32 wickets at an average of 26 with a strike rate of 49 since he came back into the team, compared with the 95 at 34 and 60 he did in the years before. Whether all this adaptability means he is the best man to take over the team if Root goes down injured is another question, because it is surely asking a lot of him to bat, bowl and captain, too. England will be hoping they never have to find out.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Whittle\u2019s Tour diary: Bernal speaks! And with that, I\u2019m done. It\u2019s been a great few weeks. Daniel Harris will be here tomorrow for the final stage to Paris. Bye! \u201cDisappointed in Steven Kruijswijk and Emanuel Buchmann today,\u201d writes, um, someone on Twitter. \u201cSo close to winning the race, maybe closer than they will ever get, and neither put pressure on Bernal or Thomas. No real attacks. Especially Buchmann only needing 20 seconds to make the podium.\u201d It did seem slightly strange, but then things can seem a bit different when you\u2019re riding up a mountain rather than sitting about in London. Here\u2019s our snap report on today\u2019s stage, and Bernal\u2019s overall victory. Sir Dave Brailsford has a chat: Brilliant. Everybody\u2019s been questioning the team. It was a brilliant race, it was the most exciting Tour de France that we\u2019ve taken part in. Credit to Alaphilippe, because he died for that jersey every day and he made a lot of people second think what they thought they knew. And I think Pinot did the same in the Pyrenees. But in the end strategy paid out over chaos, and teamwork paid out over individuals. You\u2019ve got to wait until the end of the race to make a judgement, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. Everyone was questioning the team, and you can\u2019t get better than second and first. Geraint Thomas says he\u2019s looking forward to going home and \u201cgetting out of this bubble. Because it\u2019s intense, man, it\u2019s a big, crazy circus. It\u2019ll be nice to shut the front door, just watch BBC Breakfast and just chill.\u201d To get first and second, it doesn\u2019t get any better. The fact that Egan\u2019s won above me, it\u2019s the best person to have in front of me. Obviously, it\u2019s been a crazy year for me, but I can be happy and proud that I\u2019ve done everything possible to be in the best shape here. And the whole team has been amazing. We\u2019ve taken a lot of flak as always, but I think we\u2019ve proven time and time again that we\u2019re a real strong unit and we know how to ride well and perform in this race. What\u2019s next, he\u2019s asked? A burger. And after all the predictions of chaos and doom, it was an entirely dry stage contested without any problems. The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters got it wrong again. Some background on this year\u2019s champion: Jersey news: Peter Sagan will keep the green top, and wheelies his way over the line to celebrate. Romain Bardet keeps hold of the polka dots. A great day for Bahrain Merida; not a great day for Bahrain. So having celebrated this year\u2019s tour, as many did, as the first in aeons that hasn\u2019t been dominated and dictated by Team Sky, or Ineos as they are now, they still end up in first and second. Here\u2019s the top 10 of the GC after stage 20. Bernal is the virtual champion; Alaphilippe not just off the podium, but more than two minutes away from it. Julian Alaphilippe crosses the line, more than 3min behind the winner. He had the most phenomenal fortnight, but there will be no place on the podium for him. Valverde comes in second, with Landa third. Behind them Bernal and Thomas cross the line together, hand in hand. Nibali, with nobody else in sight, coasts over the line! 400m to go: Mikel Landa attacks! Surely too late for the stage win, though. 700m to go: There\u2019s no stopping Vincenzo Nibali now. What a brilliantly-judged ride this has been from the Italian. 1.5km to go: It\u2019s five years since Nibali won a stage on the Tour de France. It looks like that run is about to end. 2km to go: Nibali has been awarded the combativity prize for the day. Which is fine, but what of the stage? He\u2019s 30sec ahead of the rest still. 3k to go: Time is running out and Nibali remains on his own at the front, 40sec ahead of his closest rival. 4km to go: \u201cWhile on the subject of bad news for the French, how\u2019s Bardet\u2019s jersey looking? Is he in danger of losing that too?\u201d wonders Nick Honeywell. Yates would seem his big worry at the moment: 27 points behind, but with 40 points up for grabs at the summit. 5km to go: It was Simon, not Adam, Yates in that three-man attack party, and they\u2019re less than 30 seconds behind Nibali now. 5.5km to go: There\u2019s your answer: Barguil, Marc Soler and Simon Yates attack. 6km to go: The question is, does anyone want to stop Nibali more than Nibali wants to not to be stopped? \u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful three weeks and even though this stage is shortened, it certainly seems to be on the edge of an explosion,\u201d says David Alderton. \u201cI don\u2019t think one could have asked for more from the race as a whole: it has had amazing time saving skills in Alaphillipe\u2019s descending, a superbly tight GC competition, and drama with Pinot losing so much time, making it all back over a weekend, then having to retire yesterday. Thomas has been stellar throughout, too. What positive stories for all. All in all a brilliant event, and life is richer for it.\u201d 7km to go: Alaphilippe is now fifth in the on-the-road standings, with Emanuel Buchmann moving into fourth. There is a big gap between fifth and sixth, or at least there was at the start of the day. 8km to go: David Gaudu is falling behind now, another Frenchman in trouble. He\u2019s only 22, and has had a fantastic Tour until this point. 9km to go: Alaphilippe is already nearly a minute behind the yellow jersey group. Pinot yesterday, and now this: it\u2019s a bad end to a great few weeks for the French. 11km to go: Kruijswijk was about 40sec behind Alaphilippe this morning, but no longer. 12km to go: Meanwhile at the front, Vincenzo Nibali goes it alone! He shoots off ahead of the breakaway group, and nobody can stick with him. 13km to go: Alaphilippe is falling back! He has dropped out of the back of the peloton, and though Enric Mas is going to try to help him up the hill, he looks knackered. 13km to go: Laurens De Plus has a long go at the front of the peloton, paving the way for Steven Kruijswijk\u2019s bid for podium glory. The bid itself, though, is yet to be seen. 14km to go: If you massively slow down the sound of excited Colombians, the result is extremely scary. 15km to go: The leaders\u2019 lead is disappearing fast: down to 1min 10sec now. 16km to go: Richie Porte has been dropped now. He\u2019s 10th in the GC, 35sec ahead of Barguil, who is looking strong. 17km to go: Dylan van Baarle has been dropped, leaving four Ineos riders in the peloton: Bernal, Thomas, Jonathan Castroviejo and Wout Poels. 18km to go: The five lead, by about 1min 50sec now, though Omar Fraile is about to join them. Alaphilippe remains in the peloton, and in second. \u201cDo teams ever make deals in-running to help each other?\u201d asks Noel Fitzpatrick. \u201cMaybe if one has a GC candidate but no domestiques left, and the other has a good team but no one in the race for a jersey/podium?\u201d Certainly riders chat during the race, and assist each other when there\u2019s mutual benefit. I\u2019m not sure about your example, and whether a team would help out someone else\u2019s rider simply because they don\u2019t have much else on, but most things that can happen have happened. 20km to go: The front five retain their two-minute lead. Behind them, Ineos move back to the front of the peloton. 24km to go: The front five is about a minute away from the peloton, but behind them a once-large breakaway group has fallen apart. There are, officially, 12 men between them and the peloton, but the situation is very fluid. 26km to go: P\u00e9richon has rejoined the leaders, so there\u2019s now a front five. \u201c25km to decide a brilliant Tour, and despite it feeling like Bernal holds all the cards, the last few days has shown no one knows anything,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cI really feel for Alaphilippe, but fear he may have burnt himself on the descent only to be completely distanced on the final climb. He\u2019s been utterly gracious. In fact, Rowe/Martin aside it\u2019s been a pretty calm Tour. What a final shoot out we have, strap yourselves in!\u201d 28km to go: There is now a front four, composed of Nibali, Gallopin, Ilnur Zakarin and Michael Woods. Alaphilippe, it seems, is aiming to keep his place on the podium rather than attack in search of that yellow jersey. 30km to go: We follow a motorbike as he accelerates past the peloton, which is strung out all over the place. There are a couple of Ineos riders among the stragglers already: Michal Kwiatkowski and Gianni Moscon. 40km to go: Soggy whoppers? That\u2019s terrifying. 31km to go: Three riders have broken clear at the front, including Pierre-Luc P\u00e9richon and Vincenzo Nibali. 33km to go: The climb has begun! Of the 29 people in the breakaway Sebastian Reichenbach is the best placed in the GC standings, sitting as he does in 18th place, 41 minutes behind Bernal. 35km to go: Two Lotto Soudal riders, Thomas de Gendt and Tim Wellens, are trying to join the leaders, who have now amalgamated into one large group, 2min 30sec ahead of the peloton. Wellens is 12 points behind Romain Bardet in the race to the polka dot jersey, and needs to ace this climb if he is to win it. 38km to go: Just a few kilometres now from the start of the climb, which is when the real action is going to happen. 43k to go: The front six is made up of Cort, Dylan Teuns, Rui Costa, Alberto Bettiol, Kevin Van Melsen and Lilian Calmejane. 45km to go: The leading group continues to pull clear of the peloton, with the gap now at 1min 40sec. There is a further group of 23 about 30sec ahead of the peloton. 47km to go: A nice moment from today, as Alaphilippe and Egan Bernal, the man who took his yellow jersey yesterday, come together this afternoon. 51km to go: Ineos are at the front of the peloton, in control. A few more riders have bridged the gap to the leading group, but none of them are GC contenders. 54km to go: Five riders went with Cort, and they\u2019ve established a small advantage \u201cThat weather in Val Thorens has nothing on what university bike racers face in the northeast US,\u201d writes David Singerman. \u201cI remember one surreal day of racing into headwinds so strong that you needed your littlest gear just to crawl downhill, and when the course looped and the headwinds became tailwinds you upshifted all the way to avoid spinning out at 40mph while flying uphill. Oh and also rain was bucketing down, so you could actually see the wind coming because the gusts stood up actual waves in the four inches of standing water on the road. Bernal and co. will be fine.\u201d 56km to go: Magnus Cort is at the front at the moment, not that it means a great deal. 58km to go: The race has almost immediately turned onto a dual carriageway, allowing everyone loads of space in which to do anything. 59km to go: The yellow flag has been waved, and they\u2019re off! The rollout has started to roll. It\u2019s due to last just a few kilometres. Here\u2019s the general classification, as it stands. There could be some changes to those podium positions today. Everyone\u2019s gathered for the start. Action imminent. Nobody has reported this on British TV, but I suppose you never know. A good little interview from a little earlier with Geraint Thomas: I think it\u2019s safe to say today\u2019s mini-stage is happening. It\u2019s due to start in about seven minutes. Here\u2019s the stage profile: a kind of flattish bit, and then a by no means flattish bit. A few hours ago the picture was considerably grimmer. I\u2019m hearing it has improved sufficiently for the shortened stage to be completed. OK, if this is the worst they\u2019ve got I think we\u2019re on for action. But then these guys should know, and then they very much seem to be expecting action. I\u2019ve already read that the caravan is not going to be running today. These guys are saying that the entire stage is off: For now, the riders are preparing to ride. Apparently the weather in and around Val Thorens has been pretty wild today. This year\u2019s tour has been gripping, but yesterday it took a turn for the ridiculous. It was the four-overthrows-off-Ben-Stokes\u2019s-bat of stage cycling, as a blizzard - a blizzard - forced stage 19 to be abruptly curtailed, and left today\u2019s 20th stage shrouded in uncertainty. So much so that even after the stage was rerouted and massively shortened, nobody quite knew if that would be enough. Even this afternoon, about an hour before the scheduled start, the teams weren\u2019t entirely sure where, when or even if it would happen. So, hello. Let\u2019s hope we get some cycling to watch, but either way, I\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s happening - or, indeed, if nothing is.",

      "body": "<p>For the past year I\u2019ve kept an allotment. Taking it over in a state of disrepair, some years after the death of the previous tenant, I\u2019ve cleared weeds, dug beds, planted apple trees, improvised panels for the greenhouse out of bits of transparent plastic conservatory roof, mowed grass and failed to fix the leak in the potting shed. In between all that, I\u2019ve grown vegetables.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always had an interest in gardening. My mother encouraged me and my brother and sister to keep a flower bed each when we were kids \u2013 mine, being in the shade next to where we buried the pets and underneath the tree house, never thrived, while my brother\u2019s was an absolute suntrap and full of delicious-smelling lavender. We all helped with the veg beds in the back garden, watering inadequately and massacring slugs, which I\u2019m not all that proud of, but must confess I enjoyed at the time.</p> <p>When my wife and I moved to a flat adjacent to the <a href=\"http://www.spahill.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Spa Hill allotments</a> in Crystal Palace, south London, 18 months ago, I thought of putting my name down for one, knowing I\u2019d get a plot quickly because I lived nearby. I kept a vegetable bed in our back garden first, though, to check my lifestyle allowed for all the watering. In the end, it did and it didn\u2019t, like anyone\u2019s life. But by the end of last summer I had another reason for wanting to grow more.</p> <p>Between 2015 and 2018, I had my head in a blender. A life-threatening illness kept my wife, Charlie, in and out of hospital, cost us all the money we\u2019d ever earned and isolated us terribly from the rest of the world. A serious trauma caused her to suddenly and unexpectedly to develop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/anorexia\" title=\"\">anorexia nervosa</a>. She was formally diagnosed in the spring of 2016.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The way to live is to love living, to immerse yourself in flavour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her condition continued to deteriorate and that autumn she spent four months in an NHS unit where I visited every day and watched as, with extraordinary courage and willpower, she regained a healthy weight. The following year, we married and bought our first home, but Charlie was still struggling to enjoy life. This time we gathered together all the money we could find and tried a private clinic. After a year of serious work there, five weeks as an inpatient then several months attending every day, she finally gained control over her illness.</p> <p><em><strong>The sense of </strong></em>emergency<em><strong> </strong></em>we had lived with began to recede a little and I started trying to assess the damage I\u2019d suffered myself. I knew I\u2019d been affected. I had flashbacks all the time to the first days in hospital, when Charlie\u2019s survival was in the balance, and I slept in the chair next to her. I hadn\u2019t really seen anyone socially since the illness was diagnosed, because anything that wasn\u2019t time spent with Charlie or time spent working to support her seemed abhorrent to me. I had lost some of my facility for speaking, finding it harder to think of words.</p> <p>I also found it difficult to eat at a table, or eat with other people, because of the memories that came with food \u2013 unless I\u2019m eating with my wife, I find it less traumatic to eat standing up and alone. For a long time I became nocturnal. I used to run round parks at four in the morning, or be in the gym when the blokes who ran the kebab shops clocked off and came in to lift weights.</p> <p>I tried therapy. First, I tried something called a \u201cworry group\u201d. Then I was sent to talking therapy. I didn\u2019t get very far. The time I had to talk through what had happened to me started to run out, and I felt like opening up those wounds without time to resolve them was going to do me more harm than good. I stepped back \u2013 and got an allotment instead.</p> <p>When you work with words, you get to know their power and their limit. I realised I needed a non-verbal way of getting over what had happened to me. My wife\u2019s illness was the first real trauma I\u2019d experienced and it broke many of my ideas about life. I discovered that some things don\u2019t have meaning and can\u2019t be turned into positives; some things are evil and senseless and take life away from you. Going over them in words won\u2019t necessarily help, because there isn\u2019t necessarily some hidden meaning, some truth you can get to, some moral to the story. There\u2019s only senseless pain, because part of life is senseless pain.</p> <p><em><strong>So I turned </strong></em>to gardening. What excited me was the opportunity to nurture things, and to grow things my wife and I could eat. We\u2019ve developed a very involved relationship with food, that has brought us closer together as we both relearn life. Part of recovery for my wife has been building a life full of recipes and beautiful ingredients and exploring ways of cooking creatively and deliciously. The way to live, it turns out, is to love living: to immerse yourself in flavour and smell, and know every step of what you\u2019re doing, be part of all of it as it happens. Growing things is a way for me to contribute to that. When I\u2019m with Charlie, she and I do an enormous amount of cooking, so I felt that keeping a garden would enrich that process, make every stage of preparing a meal a form of celebration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Visiting the allotment has helped reconnect me with other people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now we\u2019ve started harvesting. I\u2019m growing onions, garlic, peas, broads, runners, potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, leeks, lettuce, spinach, carrots, artichokes, beetroot, parsnips and courgettes. Today, I\u2019ve made a broad bean and herb pesto, and picked red new potatoes, bright as apples in the moment you unearth them, and red onions for caramelising and making into gravy. Earlier this week we made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/aug/22/how-to-cook-the-perfect-spanakopita-greek-spinach-feta-pie\" title=\"\">spanakopita</a>, my favourite meal. Every day we make salads from things I\u2019ve grown. It helps me: I feel like I\u2019m contributing to our staying well, and I lower our carbon footprint, and I make our meals taste better (the longer I leave my lettuce in the ground, the sweeter the leaves are \u2013 allotments give you flavour that supermarkets can\u2019t).</p> <p>Visiting the allotment every day has also helped reconnect me with people. I\u2019ve become part of a raggedy community I\u2019d never otherwise know, who don\u2019t know really each other\u2019s names, but lend each other seedlings and hoses and whatever anyone needs. I\u2019ve had rows there, and broken up rows between other plot-holders, but I\u2019ve also made friends, borrowed books, learned how to compost and reconnected with something beyond the verbal: the act of nurturing, the act of care.</p> <p><em><strong>It is sometimes</strong></em> frightening;<em><strong> </strong></em>sometimes difficult. Talking to people I don\u2019t know makes me feel vulnerable and when I accidentally kill some of my beetroot (for some reason I find beetroot very easy to kill), I feel as if I\u2019ve failed, and when food and failure are connected in my mind, that can send me into a tailspin. But it\u2019s been the single best way I\u2019ve found of recovering.</p> <p>When my wife\u2019s illness started, I thought that writing would help me to survive. I wrote about our struggles, and tried to bear witness, in a novel and a series of plays. But doing so wasn\u2019t cathartic for me. It just meant going through the pain again, more slowly. You don\u2019t have to do that when you\u2019re thinning your parsnips. You just have to work out how you\u2019ll cook them to make them taste good. So doing that has helped me to make the world big again, helped me start to feel less angry with everything.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m telling a story, <em>The Vanishing Hours</em>, about how people can lose what they love, and then get it back. It\u2019s more full of joy and recovery than anything I\u2019ve written in years, I think, and that\u2019s partly thanks to all the gardening.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard anecdotally that the NHS has started asking people who struggle with anxiety whether they\u2019ve considered getting an allotment. I think in the next decade, they\u2019ll start prescribing them. Mine has helped me reach out and remember that life is bigger than the corner I\u2019d been backed into.</p> <p><em>The Vanishing Hours by Barney Norris is out now, published by Doubleday (\u00a312.99).

In between all that, I\u2019ve grown vegetables. I\u2019ve always had an interest in gardening. My mother encouraged me and my brother and sister to keep a flower bed each when we were kids \u2013 mine, being in the shade next to where we buried the pets and underneath the tree house, never thrived, while my brother\u2019s was an absolute suntrap and full of delicious-smelling lavender. We all helped with the veg beds in the back garden, watering inadequately and massacring slugs, which I\u2019m not all that proud of, but must confess I enjoyed at the time. When my wife and I moved to a flat adjacent to the Spa Hill allotments in Crystal Palace, south London, 18 months ago, I thought of putting my name down for one, knowing I\u2019d get a plot quickly because I lived nearby. I kept a vegetable bed in our back garden first, though, to check my lifestyle allowed for all the watering. In the end, it did and it didn\u2019t, like anyone\u2019s life. But by the end of last summer I had another reason for wanting to grow more. Between 2015 and 2018, I had my head in a blender. A life-threatening illness kept my wife, Charlie, in and out of hospital, cost us all the money we\u2019d ever earned and isolated us terribly from the rest of the world. A serious trauma caused her to suddenly and unexpectedly to develop anorexia nervosa. She was formally diagnosed in the spring of 2016. Her condition continued to deteriorate and that autumn she spent four months in an NHS unit where I visited every day and watched as, with extraordinary courage and willpower, she regained a healthy weight. The following year, we married and bought our first home, but Charlie was still struggling to enjoy life. This time we gathered together all the money we could find and tried a private clinic. After a year of serious work there, five weeks as an inpatient then several months attending every day, she finally gained control over her illness. The sense of emergency we had lived with began to recede a little and I started trying to assess the damage I\u2019d suffered myself. I knew I\u2019d been affected. I had flashbacks all the time to the first days in hospital, when Charlie\u2019s survival was in the balance, and I slept in the chair next to her. I hadn\u2019t really seen anyone socially since the illness was diagnosed, because anything that wasn\u2019t time spent with Charlie or time spent working to support her seemed abhorrent to me. I had lost some of my facility for speaking, finding it harder to think of words. I also found it difficult to eat at a table, or eat with other people, because of the memories that came with food \u2013 unless I\u2019m eating with my wife, I find it less traumatic to eat standing up and alone. For a long time I became nocturnal. I used to run round parks at four in the morning, or be in the gym when the blokes who ran the kebab shops clocked off and came in to lift weights. I tried therapy. First, I tried something called a \u201cworry group\u201d. Then I was sent to talking therapy. I didn\u2019t get very far. The time I had to talk through what had happened to me started to run out, and I felt like opening up those wounds without time to resolve them was going to do me more harm than good. I stepped back \u2013 and got an allotment instead. When you work with words, you get to know their power and their limit. I realised I needed a non-verbal way of getting over what had happened to me. My wife\u2019s illness was the first real trauma I\u2019d experienced and it broke many of my ideas about life. I discovered that some things don\u2019t have meaning and can\u2019t be turned into positives; some things are evil and senseless and take life away from you. Going over them in words won\u2019t necessarily help, because there isn\u2019t necessarily some hidden meaning, some truth you can get to, some moral to the story. There\u2019s only senseless pain, because part of life is senseless pain. So I turned to gardening. What excited me was the opportunity to nurture things, and to grow things my wife and I could eat. We\u2019ve developed a very involved relationship with food, that has brought us closer together as we both relearn life. Part of recovery for my wife has been building a life full of recipes and beautiful ingredients and exploring ways of cooking creatively and deliciously. The way to live, it turns out, is to love living: to immerse yourself in flavour and smell, and know every step of what you\u2019re doing, be part of all of it as it happens. Growing things is a way for me to contribute to that. When I\u2019m with Charlie, she and I do an enormous amount of cooking, so I felt that keeping a garden would enrich that process, make every stage of preparing a meal a form of celebration. Now we\u2019ve started harvesting. I\u2019m growing onions, garlic, peas, broads, runners, potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, leeks, lettuce, spinach, carrots, artichokes, beetroot, parsnips and courgettes. Today, I\u2019ve made a broad bean and herb pesto, and picked red new potatoes, bright as apples in the moment you unearth them, and red onions for caramelising and making into gravy. Earlier this week we made spanakopita, my favourite meal. Every day we make salads from things I\u2019ve grown. It helps me: I feel like I\u2019m contributing to our staying well, and I lower our carbon footprint, and I make our meals taste better (the longer I leave my lettuce in the ground, the sweeter the leaves are \u2013 allotments give you flavour that supermarkets can\u2019t). Visiting the allotment every day has also helped reconnect me with people. I\u2019ve become part of a raggedy community I\u2019d never otherwise know, who don\u2019t know really each other\u2019s names, but lend each other seedlings and hoses and whatever anyone needs. I\u2019ve had rows there, and broken up rows between other plot-holders, but I\u2019ve also made friends, borrowed books, learned how to compost and reconnected with something beyond the verbal: the act of nurturing, the act of care. It is sometimes frightening; sometimes difficult. Talking to people I don\u2019t know makes me feel vulnerable and when I accidentally kill some of my beetroot (for some reason I find beetroot very easy to kill), I feel as if I\u2019ve failed, and when food and failure are connected in my mind, that can send me into a tailspin. But it\u2019s been the single best way I\u2019ve found of recovering. When my wife\u2019s illness started, I thought that writing would help me to survive. I wrote about our struggles, and tried to bear witness, in a novel and a series of plays. But doing so wasn\u2019t cathartic for me. It just meant going through the pain again, more slowly. You don\u2019t have to do that when you\u2019re thinning your parsnips. You just have to work out how you\u2019ll cook them to make them taste good. So doing that has helped me to make the world big again, helped me start to feel less angry with everything. Now I\u2019m telling a story, The Vanishing Hours, about how people can lose what they love, and then get it back. It\u2019s more full of joy and recovery than anything I\u2019ve written in years, I think, and that\u2019s partly thanks to all the gardening. I\u2019ve heard anecdotally that the NHS has started asking people who struggle with anxiety whether they\u2019ve considered getting an allotment. I think in the next decade, they\u2019ll start prescribing them. Mine has helped me reach out and remember that life is bigger than the corner I\u2019d been backed into.

      "body": "<p>Even by Mike Ashley\u2019s standards, Sport\u2019s Direct\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/26/sports-direct-shares-fall-results-delay-mike-ashley\" title=\"\">annual results statement on Friday</a> was an extraordinary performance. The idiosyncratic billionaire\u2019s comments included expressing regret about buying House of Fraser last year due to its \u201cterminal\u201d problems; urging the City regulator to offer voluntary drugs tests to the chief executives of listed businesses; revealing that none of the big four auditors are able or willing to work with Sports Direct; and railing at length over the circumstances of his company\u2019s failed bid for control of Debenhams. Oh, and there will be no profit guidance for next year.</p> <p>The coup de grace, the show-stopper, came at the end: an unresolved \u20ac674m (\u00a3605m) tax bill from the Belgian authorities. The final paragraph of the results came out of the blue and will almost certainly trigger a punitive response from investors on Monday and, in the medium term, an attempt to punish the company\u2019s board.</p> <p>Sports Direct said it would address the tax issue but Chris Wootton, the deputy finance director, acknowledged that Grant Thornton, Sports Direct\u2019s auditor, needed convincing. Given the tax bill arrived 24 hours before the results were published, this asks questions of the power dynamic between Grant Thornton and Sports Direct. How convinced were they that the Belgian taxman \u2013 wielding a bill that represents several years\u2019 worth of group profits \u2013 didn\u2019t pose a material threat to the group?</p> <p>Ashley owns 62% of the business and the 38% rump of minority shareholders will want to know whether chairman David Daly and his non-executive directors saw the tax bill coming. Indeed, they might request that an independent adviser hover over Ashley\u2019s laptop the next time he bashes out a statement.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s performance showed a retail group in trouble. It has bought too many businesses (Evans Cycles, sofa.com, Game Digital and House of Fraser have been acquired since 2018), it is struggling to keep some brands onside, and it is losing key executives at too fast a rate. Karen Byers, an important lieutenant, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/mike-ashley-karen-byers-quits-sports-direct\" title=\"\">quit this month</a> and, on Friday, Sports Direct announced the departure of its finance director. As the sprawling statement showed, now is not the time for Ashley to be losing experienced senior managers.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s farce was quintessential Ashley \u2013 compelling, wilful, excruciating \u2013 but it was neither typical nor becoming of a listed business, and that points to where the future might lie for Sports Direct\u2019s founder and chief executive.</p> <p>Despite his protestations to the contrary last week, Ashley must be considering taking the business private and probably has the liquidity and financial contacts to make it happen. A business that was worth more than 800p a share at its peak in 2014 is worth 230p, or \u00a31.2bn, now. It is also likely to be cheaper by the end of this week.</p> <p>Even if Sports Direct disappears from publicly listed life, the business remains a matter of national importance. House of Fraser, which accounts for at least 10,000 jobs on the British high street, should not be allowed to fail and at some point an ailing retail name will have to become a test of government resolve to help the industry.</p> <p>The department store\u2019s problems are shared by healthier businesses: stifling business rates, a benign tax environment for online rivals, and the lack of a properly funded government retail strategy. House of Fraser\u2019s predicament is serious and will almost certainly become a test of the government\u2019s ability to do something constructive about the state of the high street amid Brexit. Last week, the CBI said Britain\u2019s retailers had recorded the longest period of falling sales for almost eight years, while at least 75,000 retail jobs have been lost since last year. Action is needed.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Ashley should not be spared judgment. Sports Direct\u2019s misery is entirely self-made, due to an unrestrained chief executive whose ambition and belief in his own abilities as a retailer have got the better of him. Staff and shareholders will now pay the price.</p> <h2>The Cobham sale shows crashing out could spark a buyout frenzy</h2> <p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/25/us-private-equity-group-snaps-up-cobham-in-4bn-deal\" title=\"\">\u00a34bn agreed deal </a>to sell Cobham to US private equity firm Advent International could be a sign of things to come for British companies.</p> <p>Private equity firms raise cash from investors and buy companies that appear undervalued, using lots of debt. They then cut costs and, sometimes, make improvements before offloading the business, either in chunks or in one piece \u2013 often back to the shareholders who sold in the first place.</p> <p>The firms, once vilified as asset-stripping marauders, slipped out of view after the financial crisis. But, armed with a record $2.5tn (\u00a32tn) of funds and able to tap abundant cheap debt, they are on the march again. The value of buyouts reached a record $256bn in the first half of this year.</p> <p>Britain has slipped down the list of countries for acquisition targets as Brexit has clouded companies\u2019 prospects. But there is a price for any risk and we may have reached that level.</p> <p>The pound has fallen by about 17% against the dollar since the referendum, making UK companies relatively cheap for US buyers. The UK government also tends not to get involved in takeovers, reducing the hassle and risks found in other countries.</p> <p>After the vote, Advent continued buying up UK industrial companies such as Laird and Brammer. The \u00a34bn price for Cobham is its biggest bet on the UK and it has $17.5bn of funds waiting for deals. Other outfits are also taking the plunge: Blackstone, the world\u2019s biggest private equity firm, is one of three investors buying Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Madame Tussauds.</p> <p>If the pound collapses after a no-deal Brexit, UK firms will become even cheaper for buyers should they have the stomach for it.</p> <p>A buyout frenzy would raise questions for the new government. Will it seek favour with the US and preside over anything-goes capitalism? Or does it come under pressure to live up to its nationalist rhetoric and intervene?</p> <h2>Just what Britain didn\u2019t need \u2013 a Trump-led global slowdown</h2> <p>Ever since Donald Trump kicked off a trade war last year, the stability of the world economy has looked in jeopardy. Import and export activity has slumped, and with it global economic growth. Business confidence has evaporated and investment frozen.</p> <p>This week, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\" title=\"\">US Federal Reserve</a> will be tasked with picking up the pieces, and international markets are braced for the central bank to cut borrowing costs to support growth at home and abroad. Without such a step, the whole apple cart of the world economy could tumble.</p> <p>City economists expect the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter of a point on 31 July, to between 2% and 2.25%, marking the first reduction in borrowing costs in a decade.</p> <p>Central banks elsewhere have been backed into a corner by Trump\u2019s bullying tactics. The president\u2019s trade wars are having a chilling effect on the European economy, where manufacturers reliant on healthy export volumes are in the doldrums. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/25/ecb-signals-it-will-move-to-boost-growth-amid-fears-of-low-inflation\" title=\"\">European Central Bank</a> dropped the broadest hint yet last week that it would join the Fed by cutting interest rates to support faltering economic activity. </p> <p>Presented with the unique challenge of Brexit alongside this slowdown, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\" title=\"\">Bank of England</a>, too, looks more likely to cut rates than it might have done earlier this year. Threadneedle Street is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.75% until the outcome of Brexit has been determined. Crashing out without a deal this autumn would almost certainly see a cut in borrowing costs. Weaker global growth just as Britain severs itself from the EU, its biggest trading partner, would confirm such a prescription.</p> <p>Bank of England governor Mark Carney will provide an economic update on Thursday with the publication of the MPC\u2019s quarterly inflation report. Looming Brexit and Trump\u2019s trade war will have an impact. And after the elevation of the \u201cBritish Trump\u201d, Boris Johnson, to No 10, economic news in the UK is unlikely to look any rosier.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even by Mike Ashley\u2019s standards, Sport\u2019s Direct\u2019s annual results statement on Friday was an extraordinary performance. The idiosyncratic billionaire\u2019s comments included expressing regret about buying House of Fraser last year due to its \u201cterminal\u201d problems; urging the City regulator to offer voluntary drugs tests to the chief executives of listed businesses; revealing that none of the big four auditors are able or willing to work with Sports Direct; and railing at length over the circumstances of his company\u2019s failed bid for control of Debenhams. Oh, and there will be no profit guidance for next year. The coup de grace, the show-stopper, came at the end: an unresolved \u20ac674m (\u00a3605m) tax bill from the Belgian authorities. The final paragraph of the results came out of the blue and will almost certainly trigger a punitive response from investors on Monday and, in the medium term, an attempt to punish the company\u2019s board. Sports Direct said it would address the tax issue but Chris Wootton, the deputy finance director, acknowledged that Grant Thornton, Sports Direct\u2019s auditor, needed convincing. Given the tax bill arrived 24 hours before the results were published, this asks questions of the power dynamic between Grant Thornton and Sports Direct. How convinced were they that the Belgian taxman \u2013 wielding a bill that represents several years\u2019 worth of group profits \u2013 didn\u2019t pose a material threat to the group? Ashley owns 62% of the business and the 38% rump of minority shareholders will want to know whether chairman David Daly and his non-executive directors saw the tax bill coming. Indeed, they might request that an independent adviser hover over Ashley\u2019s laptop the next time he bashes out a statement. Friday\u2019s performance showed a retail group in trouble. It has bought too many businesses (Evans Cycles, sofa.com, Game Digital and House of Fraser have been acquired since 2018), it is struggling to keep some brands onside, and it is losing key executives at too fast a rate. Karen Byers, an important lieutenant, quit this month and, on Friday, Sports Direct announced the departure of its finance director. As the sprawling statement showed, now is not the time for Ashley to be losing experienced senior managers. Friday\u2019s farce was quintessential Ashley \u2013 compelling, wilful, excruciating \u2013 but it was neither typical nor becoming of a listed business, and that points to where the future might lie for Sports Direct\u2019s founder and chief executive. Despite his protestations to the contrary last week, Ashley must be considering taking the business private and probably has the liquidity and financial contacts to make it happen. A business that was worth more than 800p a share at its peak in 2014 is worth 230p, or \u00a31.2bn, now. It is also likely to be cheaper by the end of this week. Even if Sports Direct disappears from publicly listed life, the business remains a matter of national importance. House of Fraser, which accounts for at least 10,000 jobs on the British high street, should not be allowed to fail and at some point an ailing retail name will have to become a test of government resolve to help the industry. The department store\u2019s problems are shared by healthier businesses: stifling business rates, a benign tax environment for online rivals, and the lack of a properly funded government retail strategy. House of Fraser\u2019s predicament is serious and will almost certainly become a test of the government\u2019s ability to do something constructive about the state of the high street amid Brexit. Last week, the CBI said Britain\u2019s retailers had recorded the longest period of falling sales for almost eight years, while at least 75,000 retail jobs have been lost since last year. Action is needed. Nonetheless, Ashley should not be spared judgment. Sports Direct\u2019s misery is entirely self-made, due to an unrestrained chief executive whose ambition and belief in his own abilities as a retailer have got the better of him. Staff and shareholders will now pay the price. The Cobham sale shows crashing out could spark a buyout frenzy Last week\u2019s \u00a34bn agreed deal to sell Cobham to US private equity firm Advent International could be a sign of things to come for British companies. Private equity firms raise cash from investors and buy companies that appear undervalued, using lots of debt. They then cut costs and, sometimes, make improvements before offloading the business, either in chunks or in one piece \u2013 often back to the shareholders who sold in the first place. The firms, once vilified as asset-stripping marauders, slipped out of view after the financial crisis. But, armed with a record $2.5tn (\u00a32tn) of funds and able to tap abundant cheap debt, they are on the march again. The value of buyouts reached a record $256bn in the first half of this year. Britain has slipped down the list of countries for acquisition targets as Brexit has clouded companies\u2019 prospects. But there is a price for any risk and we may have reached that level. The pound has fallen by about 17% against the dollar since the referendum, making UK companies relatively cheap for US buyers. The UK government also tends not to get involved in takeovers, reducing the hassle and risks found in other countries. After the vote, Advent continued buying up UK industrial companies such as Laird and Brammer. The \u00a34bn price for Cobham is its biggest bet on the UK and it has $17.5bn of funds waiting for deals. Other outfits are also taking the plunge: Blackstone, the world\u2019s biggest private equity firm, is one of three investors buying Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Madame Tussauds. If the pound collapses after a no-deal Brexit, UK firms will become even cheaper for buyers should they have the stomach for it. A buyout frenzy would raise questions for the new government. Will it seek favour with the US and preside over anything-goes capitalism? Or does it come under pressure to live up to its nationalist rhetoric and intervene? Just what Britain didn\u2019t need \u2013 a Trump-led global slowdown Ever since Donald Trump kicked off a trade war last year, the stability of the world economy has looked in jeopardy. Import and export activity has slumped, and with it global economic growth. Business confidence has evaporated and investment frozen. This week, the US Federal Reserve will be tasked with picking up the pieces, and international markets are braced for the central bank to cut borrowing costs to support growth at home and abroad. Without such a step, the whole apple cart of the world economy could tumble. City economists expect the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter of a point on 31 July, to between 2% and 2.25%, marking the first reduction in borrowing costs in a decade. Central banks elsewhere have been backed into a corner by Trump\u2019s bullying tactics. The president\u2019s trade wars are having a chilling effect on the European economy, where manufacturers reliant on healthy export volumes are in the doldrums. The European Central Bank dropped the broadest hint yet last week that it would join the Fed by cutting interest rates to support faltering economic activity. Presented with the unique challenge of Brexit alongside this slowdown, the Bank of England, too, looks more likely to cut rates than it might have done earlier this year. Threadneedle Street is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.75% until the outcome of Brexit has been determined. Crashing out without a deal this autumn would almost certainly see a cut in borrowing costs. Weaker global growth just as Britain severs itself from the EU, its biggest trading partner, would confirm such a prescription. Bank of England governor Mark Carney will provide an economic update on Thursday with the publication of the MPC\u2019s quarterly inflation report. Looming Brexit and Trump\u2019s trade war will have an impact. And after the elevation of the \u201cBritish Trump\u201d, Boris Johnson, to No 10, economic news in the UK is unlikely to look any rosier.",

      "body": "<p>Inside Blackpool\u2019s Winter Gardens I saw my mum and dad enjoy an impromptu dance in 1977 just after we\u2019d watched a film called<em> Star Wars </em>in a nearby cinema. I also kissed a girl called Olivia there that night \u2013 my first teenage clinch. At the same venue 19 years later I witnessed Tony Blair\u2019s speech to New Labour while covering my first national party conference, the year before his election triumph.</p> <p>But I have never been to the UK\u2019s most important punk event, held annually in the seaside town \u2013 the punk <a href=\"http://www.rebellionfestivals.com/\" title=\"\">Rebellion Festival</a>. This is odd, given I was among the first wave of younger punks to emerge in Belfast in the 1970s during the Troubles. But this week I will be joining up to 10,000 punks, young and old \u2013 including many veterans of the 1970s Belfast scene \u2013 in Lancashire for the four-day extravaganza, which includes sets from the Damned, the Stranglers and UK Subs.</p> <p>As I plan my trip, I reminisce about that first family holiday to Blackpool and how I moped around the resort grumbling about \u201cmorons\u201d and \u201cidiots\u201d with my spiky hair and torn-up school blazer with chains, razor blades and Johnny Rotten button badge. Just another teenage rebel with nowhere to go.</p> <p>Except that in Belfast at the time adopting punk was a far more radical statement than for fans in the rest of the UK. A couple of years after that Blackpool holiday I found myself invading the stage at the end of the 1980 Belfast Punk Festival when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terri_Hooley\" title=\"\">Terri Hooley</a>, the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the alternative music scene in Northern Ireland and discoverer of bands such as the Undertones, made a declaration that has stayed with me all my life.</p> <p>As the concert ended, with DJ John Peel looking on as an esteemed guest, Hooley grabbed the mic, mobbed by all the young punks, including me, and boomed: \u201cNew York has the bands, London has the clothes but Belfast has the reason.\u201d</p> <p>What Hooley \u2013 founder of the Good Vibrations record store and independent music label \u2013 meant was punk in Northern Ireland had more depth, social reach and impact compared with what was now a dying fad in Britain and America.</p> <p>Organically, without any state or official sanction, this music \u201cmovement\u201d brought together youth from all sections of society, and most notably either end of the Ulster sectarian divide. For a brief few years this scene united young people like never before in a society constantly on the edge of outright civil war. Some of the most memorable songs produced reflected the war weariness, disgust and boredom about a conflict still barely a decade old. Tunes such as Stiff Little Fingers\u2019 Wasted Life expressed a plague-on-all-your-houses frustration even with the paramilitary forces that were meant either to liberate or defend us from the other side. It didn\u2019t last as disruptive events such as the 1980-81 hunger strikes inexorably drove many back across neutral no-man\u2019s land into their tribal trenches again. Yet that experience did produce lifelong friendships among people who would never have met otherwise. Some of them will be reunited in Blackpool later this week.</p> <p>\u201cReunion\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d are the two words you hear most when you talk to anyone planning to attend Rebellion, one of the largest and most enduring punk festivals anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Thomas Ian Murdock of Belfast punk veterans the Defects has been at Rebellion for 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s like meeting up with one big family every year,\u201d he says. His friend Jennie Russell-Smith founded the festival in 1996 with her partner Darren. She sums it up with one word: \u201cFamily\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cRebellion,\u201d she contends, \u201cbrings people together. You leave your politics and your problems at the door. It also cuts across the generations.\u201d</p> <p>The Hartlepool-born punk veteran says three generations of punks now come to Rebellion each year. \u201cI know grandfathers of punks who will attend with their grandchildren. It is a true, trouble-free family event.\u201d</p> <p>One of the acts that regularly play are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.K._Subs\" title=\"\">UK Subs</a> who shot to fame in the late 70s after the demise of the Sex Pistols. Their lead singer, Charlie Harper, is now 75 but still touring, including dates in Japan and China in the autumn.</p> <p>\u201cThe festival is a chance to meet some of your old mates from the old punk scene \u2013 some of the best people in the world. I\u2019ve even taken my 21-year-old grandkid to one of the Rebellions and he played his guitar at it. That\u2019s what so great about the festival. All the old mates and the new generation that are still interested in punk music,\u201d Harper says.</p> <p>He recalls with fondness one of our mutual friends, the late Bill Guiney, who came from a loyalist part of inner south Belfast but commanded respect and love from punks from every part of the city and beyond. After his death the Belfast punks held a memorial service for him in a city centre subway where they drank carry-outs and played classic punk tracks from a beat box amid the graffiti.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I love playing in Ireland and I always found the Dublin scene to be very chilled and really friendly, but Belfast was the best. There was something amazingly energetic about the place that was unique,\u201d Harper remembers.</p> <p>Praise indeed for my native town from Harper, who laughs when I suggest that there might be as many Zimmer frames as zipped trousers on display when Rebellion opens on Thursday.</p> <p>But they will all be taking part in one of the most trouble-free, peaceful and family-orientated music festivals in the world. And in the case of the Northern Irish punks, remember they discovered punk when it was important for a reason, not just for the music and the clothes. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Inside Blackpool\u2019s Winter Gardens I saw my mum and dad enjoy an impromptu dance in 1977 just after we\u2019d watched a film called Star Wars in a nearby cinema. I also kissed a girl called Olivia there that night \u2013 my first teenage clinch. At the same venue 19 years later I witnessed Tony Blair\u2019s speech to New Labour while covering my first national party conference, the year before his election triumph. But I have never been to the UK\u2019s most important punk event, held annually in the seaside town \u2013 the punk Rebellion Festival. This is odd, given I was among the first wave of younger punks to emerge in Belfast in the 1970s during the Troubles. But this week I will be joining up to 10,000 punks, young and old \u2013 including many veterans of the 1970s Belfast scene \u2013 in Lancashire for the four-day extravaganza, which includes sets from the Damned, the Stranglers and UK Subs. As I plan my trip, I reminisce about that first family holiday to Blackpool and how I moped around the resort grumbling about \u201cmorons\u201d and \u201cidiots\u201d with my spiky hair and torn-up school blazer with chains, razor blades and Johnny Rotten button badge. Just another teenage rebel with nowhere to go. Except that in Belfast at the time adopting punk was a far more radical statement than for fans in the rest of the UK. A couple of years after that Blackpool holiday I found myself invading the stage at the end of the 1980 Belfast Punk Festival when Terri Hooley, the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the alternative music scene in Northern Ireland and discoverer of bands such as the Undertones, made a declaration that has stayed with me all my life. As the concert ended, with DJ John Peel looking on as an esteemed guest, Hooley grabbed the mic, mobbed by all the young punks, including me, and boomed: \u201cNew York has the bands, London has the clothes but Belfast has the reason.\u201d What Hooley \u2013 founder of the Good Vibrations record store and independent music label \u2013 meant was punk in Northern Ireland had more depth, social reach and impact compared with what was now a dying fad in Britain and America. Organically, without any state or official sanction, this music \u201cmovement\u201d brought together youth from all sections of society, and most notably either end of the Ulster sectarian divide. For a brief few years this scene united young people like never before in a society constantly on the edge of outright civil war. Some of the most memorable songs produced reflected the war weariness, disgust and boredom about a conflict still barely a decade old. Tunes such as Stiff Little Fingers\u2019 Wasted Life expressed a plague-on-all-your-houses frustration even with the paramilitary forces that were meant either to liberate or defend us from the other side. It didn\u2019t last as disruptive events such as the 1980-81 hunger strikes inexorably drove many back across neutral no-man\u2019s land into their tribal trenches again. Yet that experience did produce lifelong friendships among people who would never have met otherwise. Some of them will be reunited in Blackpool later this week. \u201cReunion\u201d and \u201cfamily\u201d are the two words you hear most when you talk to anyone planning to attend Rebellion, one of the largest and most enduring punk festivals anywhere in the world. Thomas Ian Murdock of Belfast punk veterans the Defects has been at Rebellion for 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s like meeting up with one big family every year,\u201d he says. His friend Jennie Russell-Smith founded the festival in 1996 with her partner Darren. She sums it up with one word: \u201cFamily\u201d. \u201cRebellion,\u201d she contends, \u201cbrings people together. You leave your politics and your problems at the door. It also cuts across the generations.\u201d The Hartlepool-born punk veteran says three generations of punks now come to Rebellion each year. \u201cI know grandfathers of punks who will attend with their grandchildren. It is a true, trouble-free family event.\u201d One of the acts that regularly play are UK Subs who shot to fame in the late 70s after the demise of the Sex Pistols. Their lead singer, Charlie Harper, is now 75 but still touring, including dates in Japan and China in the autumn. \u201cThe festival is a chance to meet some of your old mates from the old punk scene \u2013 some of the best people in the world. I\u2019ve even taken my 21-year-old grandkid to one of the Rebellions and he played his guitar at it. That\u2019s what so great about the festival. All the old mates and the new generation that are still interested in punk music,\u201d Harper says. He recalls with fondness one of our mutual friends, the late Bill Guiney, who came from a loyalist part of inner south Belfast but commanded respect and love from punks from every part of the city and beyond. After his death the Belfast punks held a memorial service for him in a city centre subway where they drank carry-outs and played classic punk tracks from a beat box amid the graffiti. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I love playing in Ireland and I always found the Dublin scene to be very chilled and really friendly, but Belfast was the best. There was something amazingly energetic about the place that was unique,\u201d Harper remembers. Praise indeed for my native town from Harper, who laughs when I suggest that there might be as many Zimmer frames as zipped trousers on display when Rebellion opens on Thursday. But they will all be taking part in one of the most trouble-free, peaceful and family-orientated music festivals in the world. And in the case of the Northern Irish punks, remember they discovered punk when it was important for a reason, not just for the music and the clothes.",

      "bodyText": "If one failure was unpalatable, a second in quick succession by Ferrari in qualifying for the German Grand Prix must have left the team sick to the very stomach. Lewis Hamilton was on pole but every eye was on the Ferrari garage where ashen-faced team members stood, impotent around the machinery that had defeated them. Sebastian Vettel, at his home race at Hockenheim, could manage only a single lap and his teammate Charles Leclerc failed to set a time in Q3, leaving Ferrari facing another calamitous setback in a season beset by problems. A weekend that had begun with such promise for the Scuderia, who have yet to win a race this season, simply fell apart in less than an hour, two separate mechanical failures dumping them out of qualifying. Vettel\u2019s car suffered a problem with the airflow to the turbo in Q1 and, although the mechanics tried to work on it, they could not put the Ferrari out after a single installation lap and he was unable to set a time. He will start from the back of the grid. \u201cIt\u2019s bitter for us,\u201d Vettel said. \u201cThe car feels great and we have missed a big opportunity here.\u201d Worse followed. Leclerc had been on point in pace all weekend and had looked to be the driver to beat. Then as the moment came for him to put it all together when it mattered, his car too let him down. Despite mechanics furiously working on it they eventually had to concede defeat to a fuel system problem. There was dejection and clearly not a little disbelief as he climbed resignedly from the cockpit. Having not set a time in the final session Leclerc will start from 10th. \u201cFerrari have an illness that they need to cure and we need them to have a competitive championship,\u201d was the damning verdict of Mercedes\u2019 head of motorsport, Toto Wolff. It is perhaps a nadir for Ferrari this season and brings even more pressure to bear on the principal, Mattia Binotto. This year the Ferrari has failed to match Mercedes for pace, a hindrance exacerbated by driver errors, mechanical failures and operational mistakes. They have had opportunities to win in Bahrain, Baku, Canada and Austria but failed to convert them. In Germany every indication was that they were at very least a match for Mercedes, if not superior. The current formula has been defined by the often bullet-proof reliability of the cars, a field in which Mercedes have excelled and Ferrari been found wanting. That it should happen when they had a strong shot at pole will be doubly galling. \u201cIt is a shame but we will try to understand what happened to not reproduce it,\u201d Leclerc said with some stoicism. \u201cI felt great in the car and the car felt great. Today and all weekend. It is shame it ends up like this.\u201d Once again with Ferrari failing, Hamilton was there to turn the screw ruthlessly. The British driver was subdued in his success, perhaps still not 100% fit after suffering with a sore throat in the morning but perhaps also at being denied a real battle with the red cars. He did, however, soundly outpace Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen, who was second, and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who will start third on the grid. Hamilton has always enjoyed the challenge from Ferrari and acknowledged that F1 itself needed the Scuderia to perform. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unfortunate what happened to Ferrari today but unfortunate for the sport, too, because it was building up to be a really exciting qualifying session,\u201d he said. The British driver grasped his chance, as he has done repeatedly this season. He set the quickest time on his first hot run in Q3 with a time of 1min 11.704sec. It proved to be enough. Neither he nor any of the other drivers could better it on their second runs.

That will be her first order of business,\u201d Thompson said. She meant more than a sneaky bedroom exit, too, as reiterated later in the week by the head of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, who confirmed that this did mean there would be an openly queer relationship in the film.</p> <p>It\u2019s about time and then some. Fans have grumbled that characters who are explicitly queer in the comics have been \u201cstraightwashed\u201d for the big screen. (Thor\u2019s brother, Loki, and Ayo in <em>Black Panther</em>, for example.) Superhero stories in general can be a metaphor for coming out, so it is a wonder it\u2019s taken so long for the movies to catch up. Got a special side that has to be kept secret because you\u2019ll face discrimination for simply being who you are? I\u2019ve just saved you from watching 13 <em>X-Men</em> films.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth remembering that none of this new wave would be happening if there were not a commercial incentive for it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/black-panther\" title=\"\"><em>Black Panther</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/captain-marvel\" title=\"\"><em>Captain Marvel</em></a> showed that there was a record-breaking audience for films that strayed from the straight white male formula. Even so, it\u2019s pretty exciting that these megabudget beasts are now free to roam with female, non-white, non-straight characters at the front.</p> <p>It is easy to understand the power of seeing representations of yourself on screen, particularly if you are starved of that, but it is equally as powerful for people to get used to seeing those who are not like them, too. \u201cInclusion doesn\u2019t happen by mistake.

It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/03/tuca-and-bertie-review-bojack-horseman-lisa-hanawalt\" title=\"\">created by Lisa Hanawalt</a>, an illustrator and cartoonist who also worked on <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, which, like <em>Tuca &amp; Bertie</em>, is another show that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/14/how-bojack-horseman-became-the-most-empathetic-show-on-television\" title=\"\">defies you to be put off</a> by the words \u201cadult animation\u201d. It stars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/07/tiffany-haddish-if-meryl-streep-can-go-to-the-oscars-22-times-why-cant-i\" title=\"\">Tiffany Haddish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/23/style-statement-pregnant-ali-wong-sloaney-standup-comedian-lycra\" title=\"\">Ali Wong</a> as two birds who are best friends living in a world that is entirely animal. It is genius in the way it balances surreal humour, real heart and the painful complexities and contradictions of modern living; it also manages to show a sweetly dull architect robin accidentally eating a cake made out of his grandmother\u2019s ashes before he has a conversation with her from inside his stomach.</p> <p>Still, you can always jump in for season two. Except you can\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid, because Netflix has axed it. Hanawalt handled the untimely cancellation with impressive dignity, using Twitter to thank her cast and crew and the show\u2019s fans for their daily letters of support. \u201cNone of this makes a difference to an algorithm, but it\u2019s important to me and the way I want to continue making art in this world,\u201d she posted.</p> <p>Shows get cancelled all the time, but there is a genuine sadness to the early loss of a series as inventive, unusual and different as <em>Tuca &amp; Bertie</em>. Netflix has previously allowed intensely mediocre shows the space and time to grow and develop, so why this was only given three months to find its feet is baffling. It suggests that taking creative risks might not be worth it and I wonder if it hints at a more uniform future. Still, Netflix has a habit of reviving deceased franchises; perhaps someone could emulate this service and give <em>Tuca &amp; Bertie</em> the shot it deserves.</p> <h2>Audra McDonald: exposed by a shot in the dark</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75af654e624149743bc98acbfbf759576bb53930\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75af654e624149743bc98acbfbf759576bb53930/0_42_2189_1313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audra McDonald\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Audra McDonald: no candid cameras, please.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can only imagine the clunking moment of realisation felt by whichever opportunistic Broadway voyeur had the audacity to try to sneak a snapshot of an on-stage nude scene last week.

McDonald is starring in <em>Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune</em> alongside Michael Shannon and there are moments of nudity, which proved perplexingly irresistible to one audience member. Not only is it disrespectful, intrusive and an unforgivable break in the implicit pact of trust between audience and performer, it\u2019s also a really non-cost-effective way to get your rocks off.

They even shot a scene that showed a woman leaving Valkyrie\u2019s bedroom \u2013 Watch out, censors! Cover your eyes, prudes! \u2013 though it was cut from the final edit. When Marvel rolled out its fourth phase of superhero movies at San Diego Comic-Con last weekend, Thor: Love and Thunder sounded like an embarrassment of riches. Ragnarok director Taika Waititi remains at the helm, which is promising enough. Natalie Portman\u2019s character, Dr Jane Foster, ends up with Thor\u2019s powers, becoming Mighty Thor. And Valkyrie is back, as King of Asgard. \u201cAs new king, she needs to find her queen. That will be her first order of business,\u201d Thompson said. She meant more than a sneaky bedroom exit, too, as reiterated later in the week by the head of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, who confirmed that this did mean there would be an openly queer relationship in the film. It\u2019s about time and then some. Fans have grumbled that characters who are explicitly queer in the comics have been \u201cstraightwashed\u201d for the big screen. (Thor\u2019s brother, Loki, and Ayo in Black Panther, for example.) Superhero stories in general can be a metaphor for coming out, so it is a wonder it\u2019s taken so long for the movies to catch up. Got a special side that has to be kept secret because you\u2019ll face discrimination for simply being who you are? I\u2019ve just saved you from watching 13 X-Men films. It\u2019s worth remembering that none of this new wave would be happening if there were not a commercial incentive for it. Black Panther and Captain Marvel showed that there was a record-breaking audience for films that strayed from the straight white male formula. Even so, it\u2019s pretty exciting that these megabudget beasts are now free to roam with female, non-white, non-straight characters at the front. It is easy to understand the power of seeing representations of yourself on screen, particularly if you are starved of that, but it is equally as powerful for people to get used to seeing those who are not like them, too. \u201cInclusion doesn\u2019t happen by mistake. You have to push people,\u201d Thompson told Time magazine in May, showing exactly why she\u2019s now wearing the crown. Lisa Hanawalt: a joyous brief encounter with Tuca &amp; Bertie You might not yet have had the chance to catch Tuca &amp; Bertie, one of the best new television shows of 2019. It was created by Lisa Hanawalt, an illustrator and cartoonist who also worked on BoJack Horseman, which, like Tuca &amp; Bertie, is another show that defies you to be put off by the words \u201cadult animation\u201d. It stars Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong as two birds who are best friends living in a world that is entirely animal. It is genius in the way it balances surreal humour, real heart and the painful complexities and contradictions of modern living; it also manages to show a sweetly dull architect robin accidentally eating a cake made out of his grandmother\u2019s ashes before he has a conversation with her from inside his stomach. Still, you can always jump in for season two. Except you can\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid, because Netflix has axed it. Hanawalt handled the untimely cancellation with impressive dignity, using Twitter to thank her cast and crew and the show\u2019s fans for their daily letters of support. \u201cNone of this makes a difference to an algorithm, but it\u2019s important to me and the way I want to continue making art in this world,\u201d she posted. Shows get cancelled all the time, but there is a genuine sadness to the early loss of a series as inventive, unusual and different as Tuca &amp; Bertie. Netflix has previously allowed intensely mediocre shows the space and time to grow and develop, so why this was only given three months to find its feet is baffling. It suggests that taking creative risks might not be worth it and I wonder if it hints at a more uniform future. Still, Netflix has a habit of reviving deceased franchises; perhaps someone could emulate this service and give Tuca &amp; Bertie the shot it deserves. Audra McDonald: exposed by a shot in the dark You can only imagine the clunking moment of realisation felt by whichever opportunistic Broadway voyeur had the audacity to try to sneak a snapshot of an on-stage nude scene last week. Picture it: a man and woman are naked. You, a creep, instinctively reach for your phone, breathing heavily, only to realise a second too late that you\u2019ve left the flash on, which tends to get noticed in a quiet, dark room full of people looking at what you, still a creep, have just lit up like a Christmas tree. \u201cTo whoever it was in the audience that took a flash photo during our nude scene today: not cool. Not cool at all,\u201d tweeted Audra McDonald, Broadway legend, The Good Fight legend and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race panellist/good sport/and fine, not to be hyperbolic about it, but legend. McDonald is starring in Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune alongside Michael Shannon and there are moments of nudity, which proved perplexingly irresistible to one audience member. Not only is it disrespectful, intrusive and an unforgivable break in the implicit pact of trust between audience and performer, it\u2019s also a really non-cost-effective way to get your rocks off. Broadway tickets cost a fortune. That\u2019s one embarrassing, expensive blurry nudie pic. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.barthamate.com/\">M\u00e1t\u00e9 Bartha</a> spent 18 months living and working in military-style youth summer camps in rural Hungary. His series <em>Kontakt</em>, which won the <a href=\"https://loeildelaphotographie.com/en/arles-2019-mate-bartha-louis-roederer-discovery-award-bb/\" title=\"\">Discovery award</a> at this year\u2019s Arles photography festival as well as the last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://capacenter.hu/en/kiallitasok/capa-grand-prize-hungary-2018-exhibition/\" title=\"\">Capa Grand prize</a> in Hungary, captures the rigorous discipline as well as the camaraderie of the camps, where children between the ages of 10 and 18 sleep under canvas and wake at dawn. Their long days are a dogged regime of hard work, army-style training, hiking and survival skills, including how to use replica guns that chillingly resemble the real thing.</p> <p>\u201cI went there with many preconceptions,\u201d says Bartha, who describes himself as a pacifist, \u201cbut being there for so long made me realise I had very shallow knowledge about the military and warfare. I saw anything to do with weapons as necessarily aggressive and destructive but, for many people, learning about or even training in home defence is a natural part of growing up. It provided me a new context in which to look behind the eye-catching surface.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201ceye-catching surface\u201d, though, is what gives many of the images their visceral power. In one arresting portrait a prepubescent girl cradles a gun as she stares fiercely into his camera. In another, a gaggle of youngsters, hooded and dressed in ill-fitting army fatigues, cling to one another. In one ominous landscape, devoid of humans, a pile of realistic firearms sits on a table in the woods on the edge of a camp site. To liberal western eyes, these images suggest a kind of militaristic indoctrination.</p> <p>In Hungary, in the wake of the election of prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a rightwing populist, there has been an increase in the number of high-school military training programmes, which the government claims will make students more patriotic. The youth training camps that Bartha has photographed have been part of ordinary life in Hungary for decades. Their existence may be more to do with reinforcing national pride in a country that, as Bartha notes, \u201chas been part of many different empires, has been invaded many times and has lost a number of wars\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2c823d281e59939821f34f7e309744441bdefe6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2c823d281e59939821f34f7e309744441bdefe6/0_0_1951_2643/738.jpg\" alt=\"Kontakt V\" width=\"738\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kontakt V.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 M\u00e1t\u00e9 Bartha, courtesy of TOBE Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their ideology is essentially conservative and patriotic.

Bartha tells me that one of the leaders is a former French Foreign Legion soldier (the other is a \u201cfamily-support expert\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cThey believe that today\u2019s youth is losing its connection with some core values that enable them to function in society,\u201d says Bartha. \u201cAnd many of the parents say they\u2019re unable to discipline their children. The organisers see it as a place where kids can learn to appreciate a home, clean clothes, warm food, nature, a community, as well as learning the value of hard work.\u201d</p> <p>He is keen to emphasise the positive, even transformative, aspects of the camp experience. \u201cMost of the children who attend have never slept in a tent or lit a campfire. Some have never swum outdoors before. In the first days at camp, you see kids crying over not being able to use their mobile phones, but in the end they have this common experience of achieving something meaningful as well as their shared memories of hiking and sweating under the sun. They may even have some pretty harsh memories, like having to guard the campfire in the middle of the night, but, as I have witnessed many times, they go through a really positive transformation.\u201d</p> <p>While such character-building \u2013 usually accomplished without weapons training \u2013 is a feature of all youth summer camps, in Hungary, Bartha says, the emphasis is on building a sense of community, and the military training is seen as an essential part of creating that.</p> <p>\u201cMost of these kids are already into war games and movies. They want to see what it\u2019s like in real life. Many of them end up <em>not</em> wanting to become soldiers after their experience. There are discussions about the hardships of war, the value of life and what particular soldiers were risking, or even losing, to protect a country or an idea. In good hands, such discussions can avoid idealising heroic death or glorifying war. To them, it\u2019s about valuing what we have.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Budapest in 1987, Bartha was brought up \u201cin a family of architects and doctors\u201d and he initially studied architecture before switching to photography. Ambiguity, he says, is a \u201ccore element\u201d of his approach. That is why he chose to use a mixture of landscape and posed portraits rather than straight documentary in the <em>Kontakt </em>series. The ambiguity is there in the image of the hooded youths \u2013 what is observed, what is a kind of heightened theatre for the camera? Likewise the image of the fierce-looking young girl cradling a gun \u2013 is she troubled or posing aggressively? In <em>Kontakt</em>, it is the more tender portraits of teenagers embracing or lost in reverie that seem most natural and the most revealing.</p> <p>\u201cInitially, I wanted to shoot a documentary film,\u201d Bartha says of his hybrid approach, \u201cbut I soon realised that all the shouting and playing war games with weapons loses its exotic feeling after a while. It became mere role-play, though with some very strong visual symbols. The real happening was inside the kids, how they faced fear, love, excitement, friendship and struggle, maybe for the first time in their lives. I wanted in some way to convey that experience and to ask some other questions: what part of this is down to human nature, and what is not? To what extent are we disturbed by what we see, and what parts are we maybe even envious of?\u201d</p> <p>The organisers of the Home Defence School were remarkably open to the idea of having a stranger from the capital come into their midst with a camera. \u201cIt is very important for me to be ethically \u2018clean\u2019 with a project, to have my subjects completely understand my standpoint from the start,\u201d explains Bartha. \u201cI told them up front that the finished series might have an ambivalent reception, especially in Hungary, but they told me that they have nothing to hide. They had complete trust in me, which was surprising and also very moving. I didn\u2019t feel like an outsider. I think that they saw in me a mirror in which to observe themselves.\u201d</p> <p>How, though, did he negotiate the more ethically tricky terrain of photographing children, some of whom may have a glamorised notion of guns and warfare, all of whom are engaged in a militaristic project that many observers will interpret as indoctrination?</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t remain completely detached, but I didn\u2019t want to get too involved either,\u201d he says, with refreshing honesty. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find that line where you\u2019re able to show things that disturbed you at some point, while, at the same time, being able to show the other side \u2013 though without becoming some kind of a PR agent for the community. I thought the best approach would be to take the viewer by the hand, and lead them through the same process of discovery I underwent as I was trying to understand what I was seeing.\u201d</p> <p>Bartha has also made a short, impressionistic documentary film, <em><a href=\"https://barthamate.com/downstream-szel-viszi-1\" title=\"\">Downstream</a></em>, which traces the troubled life of a teenager called Vivien, who was abandoned by her mother as a child and finds solace and a sense of belonging in a youth military camp. On the evidence of the <a href=\"https://barthamate.com/downstream-szel-viszi-1\" title=\"\">trailer</a> on his website, it is a much more poetic, meditative exploration of the same theme through the dreams and discontents of an individual.</p> <p>\u201cI found Vivien while I was shooting <em>Kontakt</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cShe comes from a very tough background, with a lot of uncertainty, but she is also very cool and has a strong personality. She had been drifting from one adoptive family to the other, but she wants to change everything, to have a decent life, a partner, a job. I immediately started shooting with her as well. The two projects helped each other.\u201d</p> <p>Both the film and the photographs are complex responses to a controversial subject. For me, it is the quiet, tenderly observed moments that most challenge our \u2013 and his \u2013 preconceptions about these militaristic training camps for the young and impressionable.

      "body": "<p>The tussle for supremacy in the race to power the world with electricity is rewired as a heavyweight personality smackdown between Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon). According to this film \u2013 a long-shelved casualty of the Weinstein Company collapse \u2013 the professional rivalry was scarred by treachery, tragedy and ruthlessness. A formula for a sparky period piece, you might think. But there\u2019s an edge of panicky desperation to the film-making \u2013 the lurching, swooping cameras; the skittish editing; the arcing lens flare. It all seems a little too eager to distract from the fact that top-hatted, frock-coated, mutton-chopped chaps burbling on about the relative advantages of the alternating current versus direct current system does not, in fact, make for electrifying drama.</p> <p>The high-wire balance between scientific credibility and human interest is always a tricky one to pull off. Other pictures \u2013 <em>The Imitation Game</em> and <em>The Theory </em><em>of Everything</em> being recent examples \u2013 have skewed towards the more accessible end of the spectrum by emphasising the personal stories that upholster the hard edges of obsessive theoretical minds. But despite, or perhaps because of, an early bereavement in Edison\u2019s personal life, as a character he has all the warmth of a circuit diagram.</p> <p>This wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a problem \u2013 another Cumberbatch performance, in <em>The Imitation Game</em>, was similarly angular and unapproachable. But the Venn diagram intersection between the two key characters here is filled with physics and grudges but no actual interaction to speak of. Michael Mitnick\u2019s exposition-heavy screenplay contains two fleeting, presumably fictional, encounters between the pair, and just one conversation.</p> <p>Something of a satellite in the story is Nikola Tesla (Nicholas Hoult), arguably the most interesting character and certainly the one who is most underused here. Likewise the female characters: Katherine Waterston, as Westinghouse\u2019s wife, Marguerite, makes an impression but her role is mainly to deliver pithy pep talks while wearing electric-blue frocks. Edison\u2019s first wife, Mary (Tuppence Middleton), is a cursory presence; his second wife, Mina, is excised from the story altogether.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyXEBX6ZHPs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DyXEBX6ZHPs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyXEBX6ZHPs\">Watch a trailer for The Current War.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "The tussle for supremacy in the race to power the world with electricity is rewired as a heavyweight personality smackdown between Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon). According to this film \u2013 a long-shelved casualty of the Weinstein Company collapse \u2013 the professional rivalry was scarred by treachery, tragedy and ruthlessness. A formula for a sparky period piece, you might think. But there\u2019s an edge of panicky desperation to the film-making \u2013 the lurching, swooping cameras; the skittish editing; the arcing lens flare. It all seems a little too eager to distract from the fact that top-hatted, frock-coated, mutton-chopped chaps burbling on about the relative advantages of the alternating current versus direct current system does not, in fact, make for electrifying drama. The high-wire balance between scientific credibility and human interest is always a tricky one to pull off. Other pictures \u2013 The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything being recent examples \u2013 have skewed towards the more accessible end of the spectrum by emphasising the personal stories that upholster the hard edges of obsessive theoretical minds. But despite, or perhaps because of, an early bereavement in Edison\u2019s personal life, as a character he has all the warmth of a circuit diagram. This wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a problem \u2013 another Cumberbatch performance, in The Imitation Game, was similarly angular and unapproachable. But the Venn diagram intersection between the two key characters here is filled with physics and grudges but no actual interaction to speak of. Michael Mitnick\u2019s exposition-heavy screenplay contains two fleeting, presumably fictional, encounters between the pair, and just one conversation. Something of a satellite in the story is Nikola Tesla (Nicholas Hoult), arguably the most interesting character and certainly the one who is most underused here. Likewise the female characters: Katherine Waterston, as Westinghouse\u2019s wife, Marguerite, makes an impression but her role is mainly to deliver pithy pep talks while wearing electric-blue frocks. Edison\u2019s first wife, Mary (Tuppence Middleton), is a cursory presence; his second wife, Mina, is excised from the story altogether.",

      "body": "<p>A two-hour drive from Los Angeles, in the Coachella Valley desert, lies the resort city of Palm Springs: upmarket hotels, golf courses, palm trees as far as the eye can see, mountain ranges sprawling majestically in the distance. It was \u201ca slow, suburban kind of town\u2026 a very chill place to grow up,\u201d says Alia Shawkat. \u201cBy the time we were in high school, we would drive around in cars and park them and smoke weed, look at the mountains and be like: \u2018One day we\u2019re going to get out of here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Shawkat did get out of there: in 2003, aged 14, she joined the cast of sitcom <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/10/arrested-development\" title=\"\">Arrested Development</a></em>, which ran for three seasons to critical acclaim but poor ratings, only to become a cult show after it was cancelled in 2006.

Shawkat plays Tyler, the Withnail of the relationship: the larger-than-life yet complex and vulnerable foil to the marginally more restrained Laura, played by Holliday Grainger. Shawkat was leaving a boozy brunch with friends when she remembered she had a Skype call with Hyde from Australia. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten I had a work meeting \u2013 but it kind of worked: a couple of shots and a champagne in, and we got along really well.\u201d</p> <p>When shooting started in Dublin, Shawkat and Grainger had a few days to create a bond that could pass for being best friends. Hyde set tasks for them: go to some bars, have a few drinks, and ask each other questions from a list Hyde provided. Who was their own Tyler or Laura when they were younger? How did their first relationship affect their friendships? When were they partying too hard, to the point where they had to question themselves?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m close with [my dad] but I always have this anger towards him: \u201cBut you own a strip club, you\u2019ll never understand\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On screen, they portray a friendship that\u2019s both riotously fun and fraught with the kinds of setback common in any long-term relationship: priorities change, directions start to diverge. \u201cAs women we have these relationships in our lives, even more intense than a romance in some ways. And that\u2019s when it gets hard: when one doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re moving, and the other one does, someone\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Shawkat\u2019s interpretation of Tyler\u2019s character, she says, was based on \u201ca certain kind of girl I used to hang out with who was just so free-spirited and wild that, when you\u2019re at the party, they seem like the biggest hero. But you realise: \u2018Oh, she is sacrificing a lot in order to be that person every night.\u2019\u201d Shawkat turned 30 earlier this year, and this has brought with it a newfound introspection. \u201cFor me it\u2019s the first year I dropped a certain kind of excess emotion. Not that I feel disconnected, but it was just: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t really need to overthink this as much,\u2019 or: \u2018I don\u2019t need to define myself based off of this feeling.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>From an early age, Shawkat started going back and forth to Los Angeles to act in film and TV. \u201cI felt like I was living two lives,\u201d she recalls. Film runs in her family: her maternal grandfather was actor Paul Burke (<em>Valley of the Dolls</em>, <em>The Thomas Crown Affair</em>); her father is a film producer. Back in Palm Springs, there wasn\u2019t much to do for teenagers: restaurants closed early; every now and then someone\u2019s rich grandparents were out of town so there would be a house party. In the summer, when the heat became overwhelming \u2013 temperatures regularly reach 49C (120F) \u2013 it turned into a ghost town. \u201cPeople were partying really hard at a young age because they were bored,\u201d she says. \u201cI smoked pot, not much else. But looking back, people were doing heavy drugs, just in high school.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, she\u2019s glad she grew up where she did, when she did. Like everyone over the age of 30, she worries about the effect technology is having on younger generations. \u201cI find it fascinating that kids are having less sex and doing fewer drugs than ever before. On one hand, great, they\u2019re more aware. On another hand, are they not [doing these things] because they\u2019re not experiencing life through actions, but through looking at things?\u201d When she was younger she would meet up with friends at the mall. \u201cIt was a bunch of girls and boys, and it was the most exciting thing because we were like, how do we all talk to each other? Those moments are so scary, but they define you.\u201d</p> <p>Her upbringing also provided her with material for a TV show she is currently writing. Apart from working in film, Shawkat\u2019s parents run a strip club: ShowGirls Gentlemen\u2019s Club in the neighbouring Cathedral City. Although Shawkat was not allowed in until she was 21, it was a formative experience. \u201cIt definitely affected my perspective. It was never a secret, there was no shame around it.\u201d Her parents were \u201cvery normal, slightly conservative\u201d: her dad taught the football team, her mum brought snacks to school. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like they were seedy club owners: it was a business.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FN_zr4rQzY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_FN_zr4rQzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_FN_zr4rQzY\">Watch a trailer for Animals</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The show will explore the ways these years shaped Shawkat\u2019s attitudes to gender and relationships: how it made her popular with boys at school; whether it affected \u201csome form of performative nature I have in sex or with men\u201d; her figuring out her bisexuality. It also made her interrogate her dynamic with her father. \u201cI\u2019m close with him, but I always have this kind of anger towards him: \u2018But you own a strip club, you\u2019ll never fully understand me.\u2019\u201d She doesn\u2019t judge strip clubs, she adds: she loves the dances, she respects it as a profession. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the power the male gaze has, and how strip clubs have been around for ever and always will be. The male gaze drives not only society\u2019s view of women, but how women view themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Shawkat is \u201cstill grappling\u201d with the ways that, as someone in the public eye, she is turned to for political comment. She is increasingly being asked to speak on panels, which she is pleased to do, though part of her thinks: \u201cBut I\u2019m just a clown, I\u2019m just an artist.\u201d Art and politics have always reflected each other, she says, but recently the lines have become more blurred. \u201cKatharine Hepburn wasn\u2019t telling people to vote. But now that is important: especially younger kids, they\u2019re looking up to people like that. So I think there is more of a responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>This development comes with its own set of problems, she says: \u201cDonald Trump became president because of some version of celebrity culture.\u201d Almost a decade ago, when he was on TV a lot, Shawkat drew a series of Ralph Steadman-inspired <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tSZuyhthv4\" title=\"\">sketches of him</a>. \u201cI got fascinated with the way his face looked: his skin, that hair \u2013 it felt very fake. Little did I know he\u2019d actually become a political cartoon.\u201d To find hope these days, she turns to travelling (\u201cto have a perspective on things\u201d) and organising large gatherings (\u201cWhen anything\u2019s happening that feels so destructive to a whole community, you have to get closer\u201d). Shawkat\u2019s Twitter page reveals some of her concerns: immigration, Palestine, abortion, rape. But the primary way she is responding to the political crisis is through her art.</p> <p>This is also a time when women are racing to tell their own stories. After #MeToo, says Shawkat, the most noticeable change has been that more women are being hired. \u201cFriends of mine are making stuff they\u2019ve always wanted to. Who knows how long it\u2019ll last, but it\u2019s definitely a window of time where people are like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s cool to have a female of colour directing.\u2019 I mean, it always has been, but sure, whatever you say \u2013 give us the money.\u201d</p> <p>Shawkat\u2019s Iraqi, Irish, Italian and Norwegian heritage was something she attempted to downplay as a kid. In school, she was aware of a feeling of otherness (\u201cMe and the one Korean kid in my class became friends, because we were kind of different from everybody else\u201d), and when she started acting she was told she was \u201ctoo ethnic\u201d for parts. But, now, there is an appetite for different stories. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be seen for who you are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df54435473283165395c573d8f8108a7093a52f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df54435473283165395c573d8f8108a7093a52f2/108_0_1553_716/1000.png\" alt=\"Laia Costa and Alia Shawkat in Duck Butter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"461\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Laia Costa in Duck Butter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Orchard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2018 Shawkat wrote her first feature, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/20/duck-butter-review-alia-shawkat\" title=\"\">Duck Butter</a></em> \u2013 a love story in which she stars opposite Laia Costa \u2013 and directing is something she sees further down the line. A third season of <em>Search Party </em>is out next year, but<em> Arrested Development</em> is \u201cfinally getting put to rest\u201d. She thinks fondly of those years: \u201cIt was such a big part of my life, from 14 to 28. It\u2019s like family: I love it, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re moving on.\u201d</p> <p>Looking back to her teenage self, gazing at the palm trees and distant mountains, does she think she\u2019d be pleased with the way her 30-year-old self has turned out? \u201cShe\u2019d like all the new clothes, I guess. I think she\u2019d be happy I was doing the art I wanted to. That\u2019s something I always wondered: \u2018Will I have enough confidence to do what I want?\u2019 I think she would be happy. I like to think so.\u201d</p> <p><em>Animals is in cinemas from Friday</em></p>",

Little did I know he\u2019d actually become a political cartoon.\u201d To find hope these days, she turns to travelling (\u201cto have a perspective on things\u201d) and organising large gatherings (\u201cWhen anything\u2019s happening that feels so destructive to a whole community, you have to get closer\u201d). Shawkat\u2019s Twitter page reveals some of her concerns: immigration, Palestine, abortion, rape. But the primary way she is responding to the political crisis is through her art. This is also a time when women are racing to tell their own stories. After #MeToo, says Shawkat, the most noticeable change has been that more women are being hired. \u201cFriends of mine are making stuff they\u2019ve always wanted to. Who knows how long it\u2019ll last, but it\u2019s definitely a window of time where people are like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s cool to have a female of colour directing.\u2019 I mean, it always has been, but sure, whatever you say \u2013 give us the money.\u201d Shawkat\u2019s Iraqi, Irish, Italian and Norwegian heritage was something she attempted to downplay as a kid. In school, she was aware of a feeling of otherness (\u201cMe and the one Korean kid in my class became friends, because we were kind of different from everybody else\u201d), and when she started acting she was told she was \u201ctoo ethnic\u201d for parts. But, now, there is an appetite for different stories. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be seen for who you are.\u201d In 2018 Shawkat wrote her first feature, Duck Butter \u2013 a love story in which she stars opposite Laia Costa \u2013 and directing is something she sees further down the line. A third season of Search Party is out next year, but Arrested Development is \u201cfinally getting put to rest\u201d. She thinks fondly of those years: \u201cIt was such a big part of my life, from 14 to 28. It\u2019s like family: I love it, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re moving on.\u201d Looking back to her teenage self, gazing at the palm trees and distant mountains, does she think she\u2019d be pleased with the way her 30-year-old self has turned out? \u201cShe\u2019d like all the new clothes, I guess. I think she\u2019d be happy I was doing the art I wanted to. That\u2019s something I always wondered: \u2018Will I have enough confidence to do what I want?\u2019 I think she would be happy. I like to think so.\u201d Animals is in cinemas from Friday",

In the world of <a href=\"https://mineheart.com/\" title=\"\">Mineheart</a>, the company they founded in 2010, nothing is quite what it seems.

Downstairs, one of their first tasks was to remove the wall, complete with retro serving hatch, that divided the old galley kitchen from the main living area. They found the long, rustic island on eBay. It used to be a carpenter\u2019s workbench and they appreciate the \u201cdents and bashes\u201d and the deep drawer used to store tools. The white kitchen units are B&amp;Q and Brendan\u2019s father, a design teacher, made the sociable table from floor joists and piano legs. The dining chairs are a motley mismatch, but each one \u2013 by Thonet or Hans Wegner \u2013 has a story, as do the deep-buttoned Chesterfields, bought for \u201cless than \u00a316 each\u201d, says Vanessa.</p> <p>Before they moved in, the two-storey property had been rented out to students and was in a predictably awful state of neglect.

      "bodyText": "If Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice had done up a house, she might have sought out Brendan Young and Vanessa Battaglia. The Italian-English duo have a knack for art and design that confounds expectations \u2013 and pigeonholing. In the world of Mineheart, the company they founded in 2010, nothing is quite what it seems. Tiny beaded chandeliers seem to float inside overscaled Edison bulbs that dangle from brass chains. The sitters of grand 18th-century portraits blow bubblegum, and haughty flamingos in ruffs look like fugitives from an Elizabethan menagerie. Like their designs, the couple enjoy the element of surprise that greets visitors to their home. Set in a tree-lined cul-de-sac of cottages and semis, from the outside it looks like a standard 1970s house \u2013 panels of weatherboarding framing wide picture windows. Inside it\u2019s a different story. By knocking down walls and painting everything white they have conjured the illusion of a modern country cottage, with flourishes of the surreal, in the heart of Cambridge. The hands-on couple, who have a young son, did all the work themselves. Downstairs, one of their first tasks was to remove the wall, complete with retro serving hatch, that divided the old galley kitchen from the main living area. They found the long, rustic island on eBay. It used to be a carpenter\u2019s workbench and they appreciate the \u201cdents and bashes\u201d and the deep drawer used to store tools. The white kitchen units are B&amp;Q and Brendan\u2019s father, a design teacher, made the sociable table from floor joists and piano legs. The dining chairs are a motley mismatch, but each one \u2013 by Thonet or Hans Wegner \u2013 has a story, as do the deep-buttoned Chesterfields, bought for \u201cless than \u00a316 each\u201d, says Vanessa. Before they moved in, the two-storey property had been rented out to students and was in a predictably awful state of neglect. They have kept the decoration simple, adding traditional panelled doors with brass handles, swapping dingy carpets for wood flooring, distressed for antique effect. The couple has always worked at home and recently added the glazed extension at the back. It doubles as studio and yoga room for sun salutations overlooking the garden. Upstairs, they painted the floorboards white and numbered the stair treads for Antoni, now five, as he learned to count. As their business has grown, they have gathered a \u201csupport network\u201d of artists who share their aesthetic. \u201cWe\u2019ll swap ideas and images, it\u2019s a process of filtering until we hit on something original,\u201d says Brendan. Upstairs in the master bedroom, what appears to be a delicately painted mural of Baroque architecture turns out, on closer inspection, to be wallpaper, based on drawings by the German artist Simon Schubert. The pair of classical portraits that hangs over the bed is another illusion of digital imagery overlaid with real brushwork, as if an abstract artist had been let loose in a museum of old masters.

You\u2019re looking back on Earth to find subtle hints of ancient features buried under the ground. Sometimes things show up visually, but more often we are looking in different parts of the light spectrum that we can\u2019t see. For example, the near infrared shows small differences in vegetation and you might expect the vegetation growing on top of buried stone to be a little less healthy. Many thousands of new Mayan sites were found recently in the Guatemalan jungle using Lidar imaging. It is a laser system, flown from an aeroplane, that bounces pulsed laser light off the ground, revealing features which would normally be hidden below the vegetation.</p> <p><strong>Do most archaeologists use space archaeology? </strong><br>The field was born in the early 1980s but only took off about 15 years ago when satellites started being much more widely used.

It was in 2010, as part of my work on a BBC documentary project. Tanis is one of these big iconic archaeological sites, but only a tiny part of it had previously been excavated. We wondered if we could see some new features. I got satellite imagery from a very wet time of year because, compared to the sandy surroundings, the crumbling mud brick of the site absorbs water. I was zoomed in, processing the image, trying to get the small outlines of the mud brick to pop out, and when I zoomed out for the first time \u2013 boom! There was this huge map of the whole city.

I used satellite imagery of the Egyptian delta and on-the-ground survey work to show that the number of settlements dropped, from the Old Kingdom to the period directly following. Smaller settlements were likely abandoned while larger settlements remained occupied. It has given more evidence to there probably having been a serious drought that lasted for a lengthy period of time and played a more major role in the decline than previously assumed.

In 2014, I shared the results of the project with the US state department.

The state department needed proof that there was looting and that this was an ongoing problem. </p> <p><strong>How will technology further shape archaeology in the future? </strong><br>The highest resolution satellite imagery we have right now is 0.3 metres. In the next five to 10 years, I\u2019m expecting that to get down to about 0.1 metres. Imagine being able to zoom in from space and see a pottery shard! There are also more archaeologists using drones which allow you to see at a resolution of a couple of centimetres, though they can\u2019t map hundreds of square kilometres and they are banned in some places like Egypt. In the book I imagine a future where robots do the actual digging and collection. I am expecting a lot of eye-rolling from my colleagues. But look at how much surgery is done robotically. Why wouldn\u2019t archaeology adopt it too?</p> <p><strong>Where are you hoping to apply space archaeology next? </strong><br>Later this year I will be going back to an ancient Egyptian site at Lisht to carry on with our excavation work there. The Egyptian government asked our team to work on a specific tomb to secure it from looters. I want to apply some of the highest resolution satellite imagery, as well as thermal infrared imaging, to see whether we can find additional buried tombs nearby. Also, we know Egypt\u2019s capital in the Middle Kingdom, Itj-Tawy, was situated around there, but the city has never been found. It beckons! Beyond that, I am keen to experiment with new sensor systems on drones. And it would be amazing to design an archaeology-specific satellite. We don\u2019t have one of those yet.

There are also more archaeologists using drones which allow you to see at a resolution of a couple of centimetres, though they can\u2019t map hundreds of square kilometres and they are banned in some places like Egypt. In the book I imagine a future where robots do the actual digging and collection. I am expecting a lot of eye-rolling from my colleagues. But look at how much surgery is done robotically. Why wouldn\u2019t archaeology adopt it too? Where are you hoping to apply space archaeology next? Later this year I will be going back to an ancient Egyptian site at Lisht to carry on with our excavation work there. The Egyptian government asked our team to work on a specific tomb to secure it from looters. I want to apply some of the highest resolution satellite imagery, as well as thermal infrared imaging, to see whether we can find additional buried tombs nearby. Also, we know Egypt\u2019s capital in the Middle Kingdom, Itj-Tawy, was situated around there, but the city has never been found. It beckons! Beyond that, I am keen to experiment with new sensor systems on drones. And it would be amazing to design an archaeology-specific satellite. We don\u2019t have one of those yet. Any billionaire funders \u2013 do call! \u2022 Archaeology from Space: How the Future Shapes Our Past by Sarah Parcak is published by Henry Holt &amp; Company",

      "body": "<p>We were just kids. The first time I met Amolak was in autumn 1987. I was 16 and starting my first week at Luton sixth form college. My father worked on the production line at the Vauxhall car factory, my mother was a seamstress working from home and I was expected to get a stable, sensible job, have an arranged marriage and lead a quietly respectful life in obscurity. That isn\u2019t how life turned out.</p> <p>When I first ran into Amolak he had his headphones on, and when I asked what he was listening to he told me it was Bruce Springsteen. When I queried his music taste he told me Bruce was a direct line to all that was true in this world. He then handed me some cassettes and instructed me to educate myself. The music I heard changed my life. It first turned me into a confirmed Springsteen fan and it then inspired me to follow my dreams and become a writer \u2013 a journey I described in my 2007 memoir <em>Greetings from Bury Park</em> \u2013 and now I am a screenwriter of a film adaptation of the book.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/06/bruce-springsteen-soundtrack-luton-sarfraz-manzoor\" title=\"\">Blinded by the Light</a></em> is a rites of passage comedy drama directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/18/gurinder-chadha-beecham-house-is-a-flipping-radical-thing\" title=\"\">Gurinder Chadha</a>, who also directed <em>Bend It Like Beckham</em>. Set in 1987, it revisits my teenage years and much of it is directly based on real events. One unlikely consequence of this is that my teenage friendship with Amolak has now been immortalised \u2013 not something either of us could have imagined in our wildest dreams.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My teenage friendship with Amolak has now been immortalised \u2013 not something either of us could have imagined</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was deeply weird the first time I saw Viveik Kalra, who plays my character, Javed, and Aaron Phagura who plays the Amolak character, Roops. It was in April last year and I was in west London to watch Gurinder film the scenes recreating my first meeting with Amolak. It was especially strange to see Aaron because he looked exactly like the teenage Amolak \u2013 the same double denim and the same Springsteen badges and T-shirt underneath his jacket. A London school had been transformed into Luton sixth form college \u2013 there was even a banner saying \u201cWelcome to the Class of \u201987\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the rest of the film was shot in Luton, sometimes using locations that featured in our real lives. There is a cafe called Greenfields located upstairs in what used to be known as the Arndale Centre. Amolak and I have frequented it since we were teenagers. I had written a scene in Greenfields, and when Gurinder was scouting locations I suggested she see the real place. One look and she was sold, which was how I came to be at her side in Greenfields watching Viveik and Aaron in the seats where Amolak and I sat as teenagers, saying dialogue I had written, based on things we used to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73b34157976ae130f6befad71fedc1d66d2f3331\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73b34157976ae130f6befad71fedc1d66d2f3331/0_30_873_524/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sarfraz Mansoor and Amolak\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarfraz Mansoor and Amolak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picasa/Sarfraz Manzoor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two weeks ago, I sat with Amolak in a Soho screening room to show him the final cut of <em>Blinded by the Light</em>. When the film ended he was lost for words, and that is not a common occurrence. We repaired to a nearby bar, and once he had time to process it he told me that seeing the film had been one of the strangest experiences of his life. I had been telling him about my dream of turning the book into a film and he had read a draft of the screenplay, but to see it all on the big screen, with actors playing us, was overwhelming. He told me he was shocked by how much truth and authenticity I had been able to bring.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The constants in my life since I was 16 are Bruce Springsteen and Amolak  ... a friendship that has endured for 30 years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having been a journalist and broadcaster who often writes first-person pieces, I am not much fazed when strangers approach me and assume they know me. Amolak does not work in the media but he has already become a minor celebrity at work. He told me that one colleague came up to him and, when Amolak mentioned their meeting was not until later, the man said he had just come over to meet \u201cthe film star\u201d.</p> <p>The film is not released until 9 August, but I have spent the past few weeks at preview screenings across Britain and the United States.

      "bodyText": "We were just kids. The first time I met Amolak was in autumn 1987. I was 16 and starting my first week at Luton sixth form college. My father worked on the production line at the Vauxhall car factory, my mother was a seamstress working from home and I was expected to get a stable, sensible job, have an arranged marriage and lead a quietly respectful life in obscurity. That isn\u2019t how life turned out. When I first ran into Amolak he had his headphones on, and when I asked what he was listening to he told me it was Bruce Springsteen. When I queried his music taste he told me Bruce was a direct line to all that was true in this world. He then handed me some cassettes and instructed me to educate myself. The music I heard changed my life. It first turned me into a confirmed Springsteen fan and it then inspired me to follow my dreams and become a writer \u2013 a journey I described in my 2007 memoir Greetings from Bury Park \u2013 and now I am a screenwriter of a film adaptation of the book. Blinded by the Light is a rites of passage comedy drama directed by Gurinder Chadha, who also directed Bend It Like Beckham. Set in 1987, it revisits my teenage years and much of it is directly based on real events. One unlikely consequence of this is that my teenage friendship with Amolak has now been immortalised \u2013 not something either of us could have imagined in our wildest dreams. It was deeply weird the first time I saw Viveik Kalra, who plays my character, Javed, and Aaron Phagura who plays the Amolak character, Roops. It was in April last year and I was in west London to watch Gurinder film the scenes recreating my first meeting with Amolak. It was especially strange to see Aaron because he looked exactly like the teenage Amolak \u2013 the same double denim and the same Springsteen badges and T-shirt underneath his jacket. A London school had been transformed into Luton sixth form college \u2013 there was even a banner saying \u201cWelcome to the Class of \u201987\u201d. Much of the rest of the film was shot in Luton, sometimes using locations that featured in our real lives. There is a cafe called Greenfields located upstairs in what used to be known as the Arndale Centre. Amolak and I have frequented it since we were teenagers. I had written a scene in Greenfields, and when Gurinder was scouting locations I suggested she see the real place. One look and she was sold, which was how I came to be at her side in Greenfields watching Viveik and Aaron in the seats where Amolak and I sat as teenagers, saying dialogue I had written, based on things we used to say. Two weeks ago, I sat with Amolak in a Soho screening room to show him the final cut of Blinded by the Light. When the film ended he was lost for words, and that is not a common occurrence. We repaired to a nearby bar, and once he had time to process it he told me that seeing the film had been one of the strangest experiences of his life. I had been telling him about my dream of turning the book into a film and he had read a draft of the screenplay, but to see it all on the big screen, with actors playing us, was overwhelming. He told me he was shocked by how much truth and authenticity I had been able to bring. Having been a journalist and broadcaster who often writes first-person pieces, I am not much fazed when strangers approach me and assume they know me. Amolak does not work in the media but he has already become a minor celebrity at work. He told me that one colleague came up to him and, when Amolak mentioned their meeting was not until later, the man said he had just come over to meet \u201cthe film star\u201d. The film is not released until 9 August, but I have spent the past few weeks at preview screenings across Britain and the United States. One of the most common reactions is that people say they were touched by the depiction of the friendship of Javed and Roops, to the extent that people now tweet me to tell of the friend who was \u201ctheir Roops\u201d \u2013 the one who introduced them to a life-changing musician or band. My mate has become a noun. At the very end of Blinded by the Light there are a set of stills. Among the ones that prompt the biggest cheers at previews are those of Amolak and me. There is one of us taken in 1990 in New Jersey on the Asbury Park boardwalk and another one, taken last, on set in Luton. The two constants in my life since I was 16 are Springsteen and Amolak, and it is a source of great pride and pleasure to me that our friendship has endured for more than 30 years. These days, we are both middle-aged husbands and fathers but tomorrow night we will both attend the gala screening of Blinded by the Light with our wives. When the lights dim and the film starts we will be transported back to that fateful autumn of 1987 when we were just kids. Blinded by the Light is in cinemas from 9 August. Greetings from Bury Park, the memoir by Sarfraz Manzoor which inspired the film, has now been reissued with a new afterword. @sarfrazmanzoor",

But her shadow falls over a number of Lewis\u2019s efforts, beginning with Rabbit Fur Coat, her debut solo outing of 2006, recorded with the harmonies of the Watson Twins. (The title track, which she doesn\u2019t play tonight, is a heartstring-twanger. \u201cWhere my ma is now, I don\u2019t know,\u201d it goes. \u201cShe was livin\u2019 in her car, I was livin\u2019 on the road/And I hear she\u2019s puttin\u2019 that stuff up her nose.\u201d) Tonight we get a strong showing from Rabbit Fur Coat \u2013 three tracks, which culminate in one of Lewis\u2019s greatest hits, Born Secular. \u201cI was born secular and inconsolable,\u201d Lewis sings, as her backing vocalists add lustrous additional parts. One of Lewis\u2019s calling cards is chronicling the seedy underbelly of Americana; a love for gospel vying with scorn for televangelists. Lewis and her mother, by then battling terminal liver cancer brought on by hepatitis C, were reconciled in hospital. They found they liked one another. Little White Dove, another standout, unfurls a funky bassline, and reconciliation. \u201cI\u2019m the heroin,\u201d Lewis sings. In lesser hands, this would be a piano ballad. In Lewis\u2019s, it sounds like a Jack White tune produced by Dr Dre. As one YouTube commentator put it: the song is about her mother dying, \u201cand she makes it a bop\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Four days after becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson has yet to make a phone call to his Irish counterpart. Leo Varadkar appears to have been pushed back in the queue with no arrangements yet in place for the conventional call that takes place when new leaders assume office in Ireland and the UK. Johnson has already spoken to five leaders around the world including Donald Trump on Friday, who later revealed he talked about doing a trade deal \u201cfive times\u201d the size of existing arrangements with the UK. Also on Friday, Johnson contacted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to discuss a Brexit transition and in his first two days of office he spoke to Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Claude Juncker. The lack of contact with the taoiseach will add to the existing strains in Anglo-Irish relations since Johnson assumed power, with new tensions over remarks on the risks to Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the United Kingdom. Varadkar said on Friday evening that \u201cmore and more people in Northern Ireland will come to question the union\u201d if the UK crashed out of the EU, putting the region, which voted to remain, into a new historical chapter with the rest of the island of Ireland. \u201cPeople who you might describe as moderate nationalists, or moderate Catholics, who are more or less happy with the status quo, will look towards a united Ireland. And I think increasingly you see liberal Protestants and unionists who will start to ask where they feel more at home,\u201d he said at a summer school in Donegal. \u201cOne of the things that ironically could really undermine the union of the UK is a hard Brexit, both for Northern Ireland and for Scotland, and that is a problem they are going to have to face.\u201d His remarks earned a sharp rebuke from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley Jr who said his intervention was \u201cunhelpful and unnecessarily aggressive\u201d. DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the \u201chysterical and self-centred\u201d response of the Irish government to the demands of the UK prime minister to have the backstop removed from any exit deal speaks volumes. \u201cThe megaphone reaction demonstrates that the blatant attempts by Leo Varadkar and co to use the Irish border as a means of undermining Britain\u2019s referendum has backfired on them and they know it. \u201cThe Irish government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of British aggression. \u2018Poor little Ireland\u2019 may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune. The game is up. \u201cThey have overplayed their hand and they need to change course.\u201d Varadkar also said he would need to meet Johnson to understand his \u201creal red lines\u201d on Brexit, and that Ireland had shown in the past that it could be flexible. Johnson has already spoken to other leaders in the UK including Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and Michelle O\u2019Neill, the head of Sinn F\u00e9in in Northern Ireland. On Friday Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, described Johnson\u2019s comments on Brexit as \u201cunhelpful\u201d and said he appeared to be putting the UK on a \u201ccollision course\u201d with the EU. He made his remarks after what he described as a \u201cuseful\u201d meeting with Julian Smith, the new Northern Ireland secretary, who went to Belfast for a series of meetings aimed at getting the Stormont assembly up and running again. Downing Street has been approached for comment.",

It was low-scoring and lacking in goalmouth incident but full of intensity nonetheless. Port Adelaide scrapped hard to remain in the contest and ground their way towards GWS late in the final term. The Power never held the lead during the match but came within a whisker of snatching a victory at the death. </p> <p>Three goals apiece to Cameron and Finlayson took care of the scoring for the visitors while Travis Boak will wonder how he could find the ball 40 times and still end up on the losing side. </p> <p>The win lifts the Giants to fifth and backs up their win over Collingwood last time out. Defeat for Port Adelaide, on top of Adelaide\u2019s loss to Carlton, leaves that race for the last available finals spot wide open. The Crows, the only side on nine wins, are in possession, but there are now five teams on eight victories, including Fremantle and the Western Bulldogs, who face-off in Melbourne tomorrow. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1155090295165341696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">300 of the best, and what a finish to the game!<br><br>Well done <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LordHeathShaw23?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@lordheathshaw23</a>!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLPowerGiants?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLPowerGiants</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BT5lQxkWh6\">pic.twitter.com/BT5lQxkWh6</a></p>&mdash; AFL (@AFL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1155090295165341696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 27, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3c3bc58f08d0b6ca538d5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-27T12:07:28.390Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>AFL: 4 mins remaining Q4: Port Adelaide 7.13 (55) v GWS 8.8 (56) - </strong>Port Adelaide refuse to go down without a fight.

The Tigers have now won five on the bounce and look deserved flag favourites. It\u2019s a different story for the Pies who are now struggling to make the top four after slipping to their fourth defeat in five outings.</p> <p>Brisbane continue to defy the odds, beating Hawthorn in Tasmania to move level on points with ladder leaders Geelong. The Lions have played a game more than the Cats but their sixth win in a row has them in line for the most unlikely top four finish. The defeat is a hammer blow to the Hawks\u2019 chances of making the finals. They\u2019re only a game outside the eight but with a tough run home it\u2019s hard to see them making up enough ground to leapfrog both South Australian rivals - as well as any other late chargers - in the final stretch.</p> <p>Speaking of those South Australians, Adelaide will be kicking themselves for not putting daylight between themselves in eighth and the chasing pack but the Crows became the latest scalp of the Teague-inspired Blues, Carlton battling to their fifth win in seven games - the two defeats both coming by less than a goal.</p> <p>And in the last few minutes West Coast also moved level with Geelong on 13 wins after they breezed past North Melbourne. Josh Kennedy was in one of those moods, kicking seven straight for the Eagles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24b1b6466388a106f8e7bcb9a70961cc98394180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b1b6466388a106f8e7bcb9a70961cc98394180/0_0_1471_2209/666.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Kennedy\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Kennedy of the Eagles celebrates a goal during the round 19 AFL match between the West Coast Eagles and the North Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3c15958f08cf92bb777fd9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-27T09:14:28.725Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Cricket</strong>: England, by the way, announce their squad in about an hour from now.

      "bodyText": "Phew! What a night. Just one point deciding the outcome in the two big footy matches of the night. Manly\u2019s thrilling victory over Melbourne will live long in the memory, especially that series of missed field goals. Now it\u2019s time for me to pack up for the night. Thank you for your company, we\u2019ll be back to do this all again tomorrow. Cycling: The Tour de France is almost over but you can follow all the action on a decisive Stage 20 right here: The Giants hold on by their fingernails in Heath Shaw\u2019s 300th. It was low-scoring and lacking in goalmouth incident but full of intensity nonetheless. Port Adelaide scrapped hard to remain in the contest and ground their way towards GWS late in the final term. The Power never held the lead during the match but came within a whisker of snatching a victory at the death. Three goals apiece to Cameron and Finlayson took care of the scoring for the visitors while Travis Boak will wonder how he could find the ball 40 times and still end up on the losing side. The win lifts the Giants to fifth and backs up their win over Collingwood last time out. Defeat for Port Adelaide, on top of Adelaide\u2019s loss to Carlton, leaves that race for the last available finals spot wide open. The Crows, the only side on nine wins, are in possession, but there are now five teams on eight victories, including Fremantle and the Western Bulldogs, who face-off in Melbourne tomorrow. AFL: 4 mins remaining Q4: Port Adelaide 7.13 (55) v GWS 8.8 (56) - Port Adelaide refuse to go down without a fight. Just a point in it at Adelaide Oval with the Siren just four minutes away. It was nip and tuck all night but when the game was there to be won St Kilda reached out and grabbed their opportunity with both hands. Three goals in a row late in the final quarter turned an even contest into a thrilling victory for the Saints and another feather in the cap of caretaker coach Brett Ratten. Josh Bruce kicked 4.0, Seb Ross 2.0 with 31 disposals and seven tackles. The win means the Saints retain an outside chance of making the finals. Melbourne\u2019s horror season cannot end soon enough. They\u2019re now a game behind Carlton. The ladder leaders were challenged early but they responded in style, dominating the ball, dictating terms, and running out comfortable winners. The Swifts kick clear once again at the top of the ladder after the Lightning edged within one point earlier in the day. AFL: 15 mins remaining Q4: Port Adelaide 6.10 (46) v GWS 7.7 (49) - The Power have been behind all night but they haven\u2019t been as close to the Giants as they are now since the opening bounce. Robbie Gray has three and Adelaide Oval is rocking. AFL: 8 mins remaining Q4: St Kilda 13.11 (89) v Melbourne 13.6 (84) - It\u2019s a night of tight finishes, including at Marvel Stadium where the Saints and Demons are fighting tooth and nail for the four points. Ben Long has just snapped St Kilda back in front - the fifth lead change of the final term. The Wallabies are on the board in the Rugby Championship, holding off a spirited Pumas fightback to prevail at Suncorp Stadium. What an astonishing game of rugby league, won in the final minute of golden point with a Daly Cherry-Evans drop goal. Melbourne\u2019s nine-game winning streak comes to an end. NRL: 89 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - First error of added time sees Melbourne concede possession with a forward pass in defensive territory. Manly have time and field position to win it at the death. AFL: 3QT: Port Adelaide 5.9 (39) v GWS 7.7 (49) - It remains the Giants\u2019 to lose in a low-scoring contest at Adelaide Oval. Cameron and Finlayson both have bags of three for the visitors. Super Netball: 3QT: Fever 38-40 Swifts - Honours even in that third quarter with the Swifts retaining their slender advantage. NRL: 85 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - Half-time in added time. This is the most absurd NRL match in many a long day. The final play of that period lasted an age with both sides playing on after the siren. Incredible stuff. NRL: 84mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - Now Walker hits the post for Manly! This is wild! NRL: 83 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - Munster\u2019s field goal hits the post, on tackle two! So much drama! Melbourne went for the golden point following Manly being reduced to 12 after Jake Trbojevic was sin-binned for a dangerous tackle. AFL: 3QT: St Kilda 10.8 (70) v Melbourne 10.6 (66) - After a stodgy opening half this one burst into life in the third quarter. Tim Membrey kicked three to spark his Saints from a half-time deficit to a three-quarter time lead. NRL: 80 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - Golden Point required to separate these fierce rivals at AAMI Park. Manly were the better side in the opening term, Melbourne dominated after the break, and after a rash of failed field goals we\u2019ll go to added time. NRL: 80 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - Smith misses as well! What a finish at AAMI Park. NRL: 77 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - And now Croft misses for Melbourne! NRL: 76 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - Tension ramping up at AAMI Park with both teams considering drop goals to sneak into the lead. Manly have the first dart but DCE drags his effort wide after a concerted spell of pressure. Super Netball: HT: Fever 26-28 Swifts - Panic, what panic? The Swifts erased their quarter-time deficit in the blink of an eye and went into the main break two goals to the good. Helen Housby has been instrumental for the ladder leaders. NRL: 64 mins: Melbourne 10-10 Manly - I really should have waited a few seconds because just as I typed the last entry Brandon Smith burrowed his way over from dummy half next to the posts. Game on at AAMI Park! NRL: 63 mins: Melbourne 4-10 Manly - The Sea Eagles retain a handy lead but they have barely seen Storm territory this half. It\u2019s been all Melbourne since the break but despite the weight of possession they can\u2019t force another score. Rugby: 47 mins: Australia 13-3 Argentina - Lealiifano has kicked the Wallabies further ahead. NRL: 50 mins: Melbourne 4-10 Manly - This one is ticking along very nicely indeed. Melbourne have come out to play this second half and did all but score on two occasions before a piece of individual brilliance from Will Chambers finally got them on the scoreboard. AFL: HT: Port Adelaide 3.6 (24) v GWS 4.6 (30) - The Power sparked themselves into life midway through the second quarter, enlivening a match that was ebbing slowly the Giants\u2019 way. Big second half to come. Super Netball: QT: Fever 16-13 Swifts - There could be an upset brewing in the night\u2019s big Super Netball contest. The ladder leading Swifts lost the opening quarter away to West Coast Fever. The visitors dominated possession but shot at only 81%. Failure to win tonight would set up a nervy run home with Lightning closing the gap at the top earlier in the day with victory in the Queensland derby. Swimming: A fuller picture is emerging of Shayna Jack\u2019s failed doping test. AFL: HT: St Kilda 5.7 (37) v Melbourne 6.4 (40) - Midway through the quarter the Demons looked like they were stretching away but a late rally from the Saints has kept matters even at half-time. Channel Seven will be wondering why this is their Saturday night showpiece. Rugby: 33 mins: Australia 10-3 Argentina - The Wallabies are back in front in Brisbane, Hodge crossing for the first try in the right corner. NRL: HT: Melbourne 0-10 Manly - It\u2019s turning into another one of those nights for Des Hasler over Craig Bellamy. Manly have kept Melbourne scoreless at half-time at AAMI Park for the first time since round two 2018 and they\u2019ve snagged ten points of their own courtesy of a couple of penalties and a try on the stroke of the interval courtesy of a superb chase to a wicked DCE bomb. Rugby: 24 mins: Australia 3-3 Argentina - It\u2019s all square at Suncorp Stadium with a Puma penalty cancelling out the Wallabies\u2019 three-pointer from earlier. AFL: QT: Port Adelaide 0.3 (3) v GWS 2.5 (17) - That instant Giants goal was just about the highlight of the opening quarter with a distinct absence of attacking panache keeping this one on the simmer. The standout performer has been Jeremy Cameron, who has a brace, to go with seven disposals. Cricket: England have named a squad of 14 for the first Ashes Test. More on this to come but the headline news is a first Test call-up for paceman Jofra Archer. AFL: QT: St Kilda 3.2 (20) v Melbourne 5.3 (33) - Not much separating these battlers in open play but a couple of Demons goals late in the quarter see them head to the first break with their noses in front. Rugby: 10 mins: Australia 3-0 Argentina - The Wallabies have opened the scoring with a penalty against the Pumas. You can follow all the action in that one here: NRL: 15 mins: Storm 0-2 Sea Eagles - Manly think they have the first try of the night - and it would be well deserved - but as soft an obstruction as you could imagine rubs out the four points. NRL: 10 mins: Storm 0-2 Sea Eagles - Manly open the scoring at AAMI Park with a penalty following an uncharacteristically sloppy start from Melbourne. AFL: Q1: 1 min: Port Adelaide 0.0 (0) v GWS 1.0 (6) ... and it takes Jeremy Cameron just 40 seconds to hit the scoreboard. The Giants off to a flying start. AFL: Port Adelaide and GWS are primed for their clash at Adelaide Oval. The three big domestic footy contests are now all up and running. NRL: Melbourne and Manly are out on the AAMI Park turf ready to do battle in the big Saturday night rugby league blockbuster. Netball: The number of Nevilles coaching international outfits for England is back down to one with Tracey Neville being succeeded by Jess Thirlby as boss of the Netball side. Women\u2019s Ashes: In case you missed it from overnight Australia\u2019s women converted the retention of the Ashes into a resounding series victory by thumping England in the first of three T20 internationals. Meg Lanning was back to her record breaking best at Chelmsford. AFL: Q1: 2 mins: St Kilda 0.0 (0) v Melbourne 2.0 (12) - Underway in our first contest of the evening with Melbourne kicking the opening couple of goals against St Kilda at Marvel Stadium. Rugby: That sets up Australia\u2019s Test against Argentina beautifully. You can follow all that live right here: Rugby: New Zealand 16-16 South Africa - HUUUUUUGE drama in Wellington with the Springboks crossing in the final seconds to set up a kick for goal to level the scores - and it\u2019s good! What is it with New Zealand and tied scores? NRL: It\u2019s been nip and tuck in the NRL so far this round with the Sharks, Tigers, Rabbitohs, and Eels all winning by four points or fewer. The only outlier has been the Queensland derby with the hapless Titans succumbing to a drubbing at the hands of the Broncos. AFL: A quick whip around the grounds from the round so far reveals some intriguing results. At the pointy end, Richmond restated their premiership credentials by hammering Collingwood on Friday night. The Tigers have now won five on the bounce and look deserved flag favourites. It\u2019s a different story for the Pies who are now struggling to make the top four after slipping to their fourth defeat in five outings. Brisbane continue to defy the odds, beating Hawthorn in Tasmania to move level on points with ladder leaders Geelong. The Lions have played a game more than the Cats but their sixth win in a row has them in line for the most unlikely top four finish. The defeat is a hammer blow to the Hawks\u2019 chances of making the finals. They\u2019re only a game outside the eight but with a tough run home it\u2019s hard to see them making up enough ground to leapfrog both South Australian rivals - as well as any other late chargers - in the final stretch. Speaking of those South Australians, Adelaide will be kicking themselves for not putting daylight between themselves in eighth and the chasing pack but the Crows became the latest scalp of the Teague-inspired Blues, Carlton battling to their fifth win in seven games - the two defeats both coming by less than a goal. And in the last few minutes West Coast also moved level with Geelong on 13 wins after they breezed past North Melbourne. Josh Kennedy was in one of those moods, kicking seven straight for the Eagles. Cricket: England, by the way, announce their squad in about an hour from now. They will have learned precious little from their hit out against Ireland, a win that contained plenty of embarrassment but avoided ignominy. Cricket: Australia announced its Ashes squad this week and there were a couple of surprises among the 17 men named. The most eye-catching selection was perhaps Cameron Bancroft\u2019s. His recall means all three miscreants from the Cape Town catastrophe have now been reintegrated at the highest level. Geoff Lemon literally wrote the book on what happened in Cape Town and he\u2019s cast his expert eye over Bancroft\u2019s readmission to the Test arena. Selectors always wanted Bancroft back. In Australian cricket circles he is considered the unluckiest of the ball-tampering trio; a junior bystander dragged into the mess. He is also a personal favourite of the national coach, Justin Langer, who coached Bancroft\u2019s entire pre-Test career at Western Australia and comforted him on returning home distraught from South Africa. Football: Couple of pieces of Real Madrid news that are worth sharing. The first involves Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side\u2019s extraordinary 7-3 preseason defeat at the hands of neighbours Atletico. The clash in New York ended with both sides reduced to ten men and raises pressure on the coach following a 3-1 defeat to Bayern Munich earlier in the week. And Real look like they will soon be without the services of Gareth Bale. Once the costliest player in the world, the 30-year old is now on the brink of a move to China. The Welsh international could eventually face Australian opposition in the Asian Champions League if his move to Jiangsu Suning goes through as expected. AFL: You don\u2019t see this every day. Surely Eleni Glouftsis should have responded with the goal sign? Swimming: The Sunday Telegraph is reporting Australian swimmer Shayna Jack has failed a drug test at the world championships. This will inevitably put a different spin on some of the commentary of recent days around Sun Yang. NRL: Sydney\u2019s protracted stadium building farce continues to embarrass all parties with the company contracted to knock down the old Allianz Arena saying the NSW government isn\u2019t stumping up a sufficient amount of cash for them to consider the rebuilding job. Another construction firm will now be engaged with growing concerns for the viability of the original $729m budget. Swimming: Before we hammer into the live stuff there\u2019s time to catch-up on some of the biggest stories from the weekend so far and we begin with some awful news from the World Aquatic Championships in Gwangju where a balcony in a nightclub near the athletes\u2019 village has collapsed, killing two South Koreans and injuring a number of international competitors. Hello everybody and welcome to another busy instalment of Sportwatch. On tonight\u2019s menu there\u2019s live AFL, NRL, and Super Netball, as well as plenty of other sport going on around the world to report. In the AFL St Kilda and Melbourne will try to put their moribund seasons to one side for a couple of hours from 7.25pm and fulfil their contractual obligations. Meanwhile, in the game with something at stake, Port Adelaide welcome GWS to Adelaide Oval at 7.40pm. The Power dare not lose with their finals chances already hanging by a thread. Over in the NRL a pair of bona fide finals contenders go at it from 7.35pm with Manly travelling to Melbourne to renew of one of the competition\u2019s narkiest rivalries. Finally, in Super Netball, the ladder leading Swifts journey west to battle the Fever from 8pm. Despite the tough opposition the home side will see this contest as a must-win to remain in the hunt for the playoffs. If you think this rundown is ignoring the Rugby Championship, fear not, because Australia v Argentina has its own dedicated minute-by-minute liveblog. On top of all of that there\u2019s no shortage of stuff going on outside Australia, including the World Aquatic Championships, the Tour de France, the German Grand Prix, the Evian Championship, build-up to the Ashes, and much more besides that will make itself known to me when it becomes newsworthy. You can of course contribute along the way. Anything pithy can be tweeted to @JPHowcroft. Anything longer should be emailed to jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com.",

The lineout too doing well, with just one thrown away.</p> <p>Argentina did have their chances - skipper Pablo Matera incredibly disappointed post-match that his side didn\u2019t make more of their opportunities and bemoaning the loss of ball under contact.</p> <p>They pick up a second losing bonus point in as many rounds, but both sides with plenty to work on ahead of the round 3 matches on August 10.</p> <p>Michael Hooper saying his chargers will put their feet up for a little bit; get away from rugby for a while and freshen up. They\u2019ll face the All Blacks in Perth, so you\u2019d imagine not too much time fishing.</p> <p>It\u2019s a reduced Rugby Championship in 2019 given the forthcoming World Cup, which means bonus points and points for/against could come into play following that remarkable draw in Wellington earlier on.</p> <p>We could see a first ever Springboks series win.

You\u2019d love to say \u201coff-field ructions\u201d were the low point - but a 4 from 13 record on the pitch suggests there was plenty wrong inside Chez Wallabies. Michael Cheika\u2019s vision for the side has repeatedly coming into question with tinkering giving way to significant shifts in personnel. Now a \u201csimplified\u201d return to attacking rugby is the cry ahead of the World Cup - but as the first round Rugby Championship loss to South Africa suggested, there\u2019s still plenty to do if Australia is to challenge at all in the forthcoming World Cup. </p> <p>Argentina are coming off a pretty impressive first round showing against the All Blacks where they lost narrowly 16-20, but their record in Australia will give the Wallabies some comfort. It\u2019s 13-2 on Australia soil - but concerningly one of those two wins for the Pumas came on the Gold Coast, last year.</p> <p>On the bright side it\u2019s a stunning return to the side after a three-year absence for Christian Lealiifano - who has battled cancer to return to the top.

      "bodyText": "So a solid, if not spectacular win for the Wallabies. One of the more resolute performances defensively, with the scrum particularly strong - 11 home feeds won, with 2/7 pinched against the feed. The lineout too doing well, with just one thrown away. Argentina did have their chances - skipper Pablo Matera incredibly disappointed post-match that his side didn\u2019t make more of their opportunities and bemoaning the loss of ball under contact. They pick up a second losing bonus point in as many rounds, but both sides with plenty to work on ahead of the round 3 matches on August 10. Michael Hooper saying his chargers will put their feet up for a little bit; get away from rugby for a while and freshen up. They\u2019ll face the All Blacks in Perth, so you\u2019d imagine not too much time fishing. It\u2019s a reduced Rugby Championship in 2019 given the forthcoming World Cup, which means bonus points and points for/against could come into play following that remarkable draw in Wellington earlier on. We could see a first ever Springboks series win. Plenty to play for in the final rounds then. Thanks for your company tonight! Toodlepip. The hooter sounds, but we reset for a scrum. And again. Both front rows receive a talking to. Eventually we have a feed, and White flilcks to Toomua who happily pumps into touch. That\u2019s all she wrote - an important win for Australia in the Rugby Championship, six straight wins in Brisbane for the Wallabies, and a 16th win on Australian soil against the Pumas. 78 min: Oh my! A big knock on from the Pumas about 10m out from their own line. Is that the game? Nic White with a clever pass out to Kerevi who kicks and chases to force the error. We pack down for a scrum, and surely it\u2019s Australia\u2019s now. 76 min: Penalty miss! Not the most difficult chance we\u2019ve seen tonight but Toomua\u2019s missed it, drifting away to the right. Could this cost the Wallabies? Let\u2019s see. 75 min: Wallabies with a scrum feed. They haven\u2019t lost one - yet. Time to smother the game, control the pill for a bit. And they\u2019ve earned a scrum penalty! Argentina\u2019s front row has collapsed. It\u2019s been one of their best facets tonight, Australia and it might just give them the chance to go outside a converted try. 73 min: They stack the lineout, 11 men in that, I believe. They set for the drive, the Pumas and through a sheer weight of numbers they finally, finally, breach the Wallabies line! Sanchez with the extras. Can they muster something late, here, Argentina?! 72 min: Some lovely passages from the Pumas, who are hitting the line hard, still, and backing up well. They have the advantage though after Jones is pinged for offside. They elect to kick to touch - a lineout from about 8m out. What can they fashion? 70 min: Another big scrum from the Wallabies - they\u2019ve earned a second scrum penalty of the match. Salakaia-Loto with another handling error. They\u2019ve lost too many old heads out there perhaps. No Genia, and a lot of changes. It\u2019s all looking a little disjointed. 68 min: Argentina probing again, but they do enough defensively, the Wallabies. And it\u2019s James O\u2019Connor finally on the pitch, Kuridrani makes way. 2,100+ days since he\u2019s last played for the Wallabies. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s a more mature player these days. Both captains talking to the referee - Matera not happy about a high hit from Hooper, that has drawn blood. Our Kiwi whistle man is having none of it. 65 min: An accidental finger in the eye to Hooper, who is then guilty of a rare fumble. Probably a fair link between those two events. Luke Jones - another one returning from a fair absence in the green &amp; gold: five years in fact - jogs on for Naisarani. They\u2019ve gone off the boil over the last fifteen or so, Australia. Need to get Kerevi on the ball. Or anyone else that fancies a bit of go-forward, really. 63 min: They\u2019re not giving up, the Pumas. Another penalty, and they kick for the corner - again chasing the seven, not the three. They get within 5m of the Australian line, once again, but they force the play once more and a final pass is adjudged forward. An off-the-ball incident goes to the TMO with Toomua appearing to take a player late. Nothing there to worry, and we reset for an Argentine lineout following the clearing kick. 60 min: Big ovation for Will Genia from the Brisbane crowd - he\u2019s played the most games at Suncorp of any Australian; could that be his last? Nick White and Rob Simmons come into the fray - it\u2019s another halves combo. Salakaia-Loto with the handling error - he\u2019s dropped that cold under not too much pressure. They need to be better, both teams. This won\u2019t do against top five rugby nations come Japan. 58 min: Rodda with a good steal from the lineout. Now it\u2019s Australia guilty of forcing the play. Good hands along the backline, but Hooper pops a pass to Hodge, but he\u2019s got no more than a metre to work within and the pass goes astray. The scrambling defence from Argentina tonight has been impressive, it must be said. 57 min: Toomua with a nice run at the line from the scrum, but the Pumas have turned them over at the breakdown. Inside the 22 and a real chance - but they choose the wrong option! 2-v-1 out wide, and they elect to put it on the toe - ball into touch! Deary me. 55 min: Still plenty of willing work from both sides - you can\u2019t fault the effort out there. Credit also the Wallabies defence - their defensive line has played a role in a lot of the Argentine errors, but so too has a persistence of running a very flat line. You can understand the eyes coming off the ball with men like Kerevi, Kuridrani or Hooper about to hit you in the tackle. Something for the Pumas coaches to look at. 52 min: Good pressure from the Pumas defence as they look to put Koroibete under a heap of heat 5m out from his own line, but Genia with another inch-perfect clearing kick to force the play back to the halfway line. A decent kick in reply from the Pumas, who pin Australia 5m out from their own line and force them to defend a line out throw. But another Argentine knock-on lets the hosts off. Have they greased the balls? Or have the Pumas all had manicures before the game? That\u2019s something like 15 handling errors for the visitors. Literally throwing it away, tonight. Lealiifano accurate once again - hardly a foot wrong tonight on his return, and he makes way for Toomua. Big cheer from the home crowd for the Brumbies captain. A chance now for Australia to try another halves combination. 48 min: Tongan Thor, Tupou, is on the pitch - a half-time sub, I believe and he plays a clever pop pass. Genia calls Koroibete in from the winger for a clever ball inside - some nice combinations here. Matt Toomua also posed to come on, as Australia look to add another three points from the boot. 47 min: Genia fires some hard flat passes - well held by Arnold and then one of the outside backs, but the Pumas scramble well. Slipper comes on for Sio as a break in play for Moyano who\u2019s covered in claret. A nasty head knock there. Line out, Australia. 45 min: Sio with the loose pass as Australia look to capitalise on another Pumas handling error, but Sio can\u2019t make it stick. Moyano receives some running repairs in backplay. Lealiifano makes it 3/3 on his return with a tricky chance about 15m in from the touchline. A quick chat with Michael Cheika, who\u2019s called on his players to not panic and keep working on the basics. Particularly around the ruck, but he\u2019s happy with the running lines from his backs so far, the Wallabies boss. We\u2019re back! Australia kick off, and again, the Pumas have dropped the first ball! Sheesh. Mario Ledesma would have hardly hit his seat and probably feels inclined for a Cheika-style spray. Whatever words he told his chargers at half-time have probably gone out the window already. And if you missed the news from the earlier Rugby Championship clash between New Zealand and South Africa, here\u2019s the report: A fascinating clash at the Cake Tin in Wellington. What ramifications could that have for the 2019 Rugby Championship? Are Boks a chance for the silverware now? So - your thoughts on that opening stanza? On balance of play, the scoreline is a fair reflection, no? That said - the Pumas did absolutely butcher a try. It could have been 10-10 despite all the huffing and puffing from the big men in gold. Will Genia looking very good out there - the halves combo with Lealiifano seems to be gelling nicely. And there\u2019s the hooter! Beale with a terrific clearing kick into touch and Australia pinch the lineout to muster one last push. They spread it through the hands, but Argentina are able to slide comfortably. 38 min: Feels like the first time we\u2019ve had 10 phases - as Argentina probe around the edges once again. The Wallabies defence is good to the task however. And they look to run out of ideas as players get in each others\u2019 way and it\u2019s ball to ground. They\u2019re looking for half-time, you\u2019d imagine. Need to reset, refocus, do Argentina. 36 min: Australia with an offensive lineout after some fine work from the boot of Genia. They\u2019re right on the Pumas\u2019 line - this would really hurt if they could bag a 5-pointer. But it\u2019s a loose carry! Or put more positively, it\u2019s a great defence tackle that dislodges the ball of the one-out runner. They\u2019ve looked pretty solid defensively, Argentina. Credit where credit is due. 34 min: Some good momentum here for the Wallabies - can they punish their visitors just before half-time? Good metres once again, and some forward momentum. But it\u2019s another obstruction call, this time on Beale. 31 min: Special stuff! Australia with the feed 10 inside the Puma\u2019s half and from the set play it\u2019s a fine set piece. Lealiifano with ball in hand, Koroibete with a great line, Kuridrani and Kerevi the decoys and they\u2019ve bamboozled Argentina\u2019s defence. Lealiifano with the conversion, fine strike from near the touchline. Great well-worked set piece - when\u2019s the last time the Wallabies have successfully prosecuted one of those?! Lovely. 28 min: Good claim from a highball from Beale, but now Australia have given away another penalty about 30m out! Kuridrani pinged for a shepherd. They take it quickly, the Pumas - chasing the seven over the three - but it doesn\u2019t come off! It\u2019s another handling error - Argentina\u2019s 10th of the game. What a bizarre section of this match. 25 min: BIG LETOFF! Oh my. They\u2019ve popped a serious of passes to bust open the Wallabies defence straight from the restart, and with three or four spare players about 5m out the Pumas have butchered one! It\u2019s a knock-on - a tough ball for a big man, Chaparro, I think. But they\u2019ll be kicking themselves. What a chance to grab a shock lead! The outcome of that poor lineout option is an error about 30m out, and the Pumas say: yes please. Sanchez with the successful shot at the sticks, and we\u2019re all square, despite the Wallabies territorial dominance. 21 min: We look down on another half-way scrum, this time with a Wallabies feed. And they\u2019ve earned the penalty! Pumas front row accused of angling in and Hodge kicks for touch. Good work Scott Sio at the scrum. Deary me - it\u2019s the long line out feed, and it misses all the jumpers and almost sparks a Pumas counter attack! What a waste. 18 min: Wow! A lively few moments. Big hit on Lealiifano from the Argie\u2019s skipper Matera. Australia almost regather a clever kick and chase but Kuridrani just can\u2019t reel it in. Before the Pumas hammer Hodge into touch with a great tackle and it sparks a brief melee! A bit of feeling out there. Most likely frustration from both sides from their handling, and also a bit of nervous energy being let off. 15 min: Scrum to Argentina right on halfway after Naisarani is pinged for an infringement. The stat\u2019s already come up that Kerevi\u2019s made 50m in the first 15 minutes already. None of that is clear air running, so we were right to identify him as a danger man today! A few decent runs for the Pumas now, they reach the 22. They\u2019re passing very flat, and they turn it over. Nearly a hospital pass that as the defence clatters the man just as he receives and we have a turnover. 12 min: Great bust, Rodda! They were flying up in the defensive line, the Pumas, and Genia pops a terrific short pass to put the tall timber through the line. It\u2019s undone with a knock on - big let off there. But positive signs that they\u2019re looking to run, rather than kick, the hosts. Beale looking for Hodge earlier, and some solid gains once again. He slots it nicely! It hooked a little to the left, but still comfortably through the posts. That will help settle any residual nerves for the flyhalf. Probably a fair reflection of the first ten - in which Australia have dominated in terms of metres gained, ball in hand. 10 min: Australia gain 25-30m before earning their first penalty. Again it\u2019s Kerevi making the key yards. Lealiifano with his first look at points as a Wallaby - nearly 1,000 days since his last. 8 min: Is it greasy out there? The Pumas have just put down a drop out cold. Yes, there was some pressure coming through, but they have to hold those. Australian scrum, 10m inside their own half. 6 min: They\u2019re making good metres up the guts, Australia - but having done the hard work, once again, they\u2019re too slow to the breakdown, and the Pumas pinch it. Key area - 25m out. Need to capitalise on the hard running, Wallabies. Still, promising signs that they\u2019re making the metres. A lot of errors from both sides, early on. That\u2019s 2-3 significant errors from the Wallabies, but neither side have punished their opponents. 4 min: Pumas with ball in hand, they flick wide but can\u2019t get round the wall of gold. They continue to work the short side, no joy on Australia\u2019s left edge. The attacking momentum peters out and the Wallabies bring it out once again. 2 min: Good defence, Australia and they force the fumble. It\u2019s a first scrum after the Pumas\u2019 knock on. A fair weight advantage, Australia - they\u2019re 60+kg on Argentina\u2019s front eight. Wallabies with a good bust from Kerevi, some loose carries but they get away with it. They spread wide to Hodge, who looks to skip round his opposite number, but it\u2019s a penalty to Argentina. Too slow to the breakdown, and they\u2019ve turned it over. 1 min: And we\u2019re away! It\u2019s Argentina who kick off, deep into Australia\u2019s 22. And it\u2019s Genia who clears for touch. A decent clearance - not too much on it. Argentina get their first look ball in hand 10m inside the Wallabies\u2019 half. So - to live action: we\u2019ve got both our teams out on the field and the anthems are underway. Decent looking crowd in at Suncorp in Brisbane. Don\u2019t forget, this match as well as being a key Rugby Championship match will also decide the Puma Cup between Australia and Argentina. A nice pic of Lealiifano greeting the fans as he came out for warm-up. Even with 19 caps, he\u2019ll still be incredibly nervous tonight. He may once have never imagined he\u2019d be pulling on the famous jersey again. So - who do think could be the X-factors today? And how will the new-look halves pair of Will Genia and Lealiifano go? Let us know your top tips. One player who Argentina will be watching closely is the one-man wrecking ball with the No 12 on his back - Samu Kerevi. He\u2019s had an up-and-down career in the green &amp; gold, but when he\u2019s on, oh, he\u2019s on. So - without further ado - some team news: As mentioned in the preamble the big in is Brumbies skipper Christian Lealiifano - who comes in at flyhalf in the place of the beleaguered Bernard Foley. Marika Koroibete returns after the birth of his second child, Kurtley Beale comes back in at fullback with no place for Nick White, Tom Banks or Dane Haylett-Petty. Scott Sio also comes in for James Slipper on the front row. James O\u2019Connor - remember him? Once the rising star of Australian Rugby, then the enfant terrible; now the prodigal son. He\u2019s on the bench after a SIX year absence in the green and gold. Could he be a key boost ahead of the Japan World Cup? Teams: Australia: 15 Kurtley Beale, 14 Reece Hodge, 13 Tevita Kuridrani, 12 Samu Kerevi, 11 Marika Koroibete, 10 Christian Lealiifano, 9 Will Genia, 8 Isi Naisarani, 7 Michael Hooper (captain), 6 Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, 5 Rory Arnold, 4 Izack Rodda, 3 Sekope Kepu, 2 Folau Fainga\u2019a, 1 Scott Sio. Bench: 16 Tolu Latu, 17 James Slipper, 18 Taniela Tupou, 19 Rob Simmons, 20 Luke Jones, 21 Nic White, 22 Matt Toomua, 23 James O\u2019Connor. Argentina: 15 Joaquin Tuculet, 14 Santiago Cordero, 13 Matias Moroni, 12 Jeronimo de la Fuente, 11 Ramiro Moyano, 10 Nicolas Sanchez, 9 Tomas Cubelli, 8 Facundo Isa, 7 Tomas Lezana, 6 Pablo Matera (captain), 5 Tomas Lavanini, 4 Guido Petti, 3 Juan Figallo, 2 Julian Montoya, 1 Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro. Bench: 16 Santiago Socino, 17 Mayco Vivas, 18 Ramiro Herrera, 19 Matias Alemanno, 20 Juan Manuel Leguizamon, 21 Felipe Ezcurra, 22 Joaquin Diaz Bonilla, 23 Matias Orlando Fulltime: New Zealand 16-16 South Africa Some big news from the earlier Rugby Championship clash between New Zealand and South Africa - a 78th minute try to Boks and a pressure conversion from a tough angle has secured an unlikely draw in Wellington. They were good value for it, the Boks, despite conceding a raft of penalties in the second half. Injury to Sonny Bill Williams and a nasty knock to Brodie Retallick added concerns for Steve Hansen and his staff. Interesting times. Hi all! Thanks for joining our coverage, wherever in the world you\u2019re following this. On the intermittent wifi in the Orkneys? Grabbing the phone in between meetings in Macau? Drop us a line and join our coverage. I\u2019m on email or twitter - your best predictions, insights and analysis welcome. We\u2019re not a million miles away from first whistle in Brisbane - before then here\u2019s some worthy background reading. Our rugby correspondent, Bret Harris, with a sober view of the Wallabies loss to South Africa: 2018 was an Annus Horribilis for Australian Rugby. You\u2019d love to say \u201coff-field ructions\u201d were the low point - but a 4 from 13 record on the pitch suggests there was plenty wrong inside Chez Wallabies. Michael Cheika\u2019s vision for the side has repeatedly coming into question with tinkering giving way to significant shifts in personnel. Now a \u201csimplified\u201d return to attacking rugby is the cry ahead of the World Cup - but as the first round Rugby Championship loss to South Africa suggested, there\u2019s still plenty to do if Australia is to challenge at all in the forthcoming World Cup. Argentina are coming off a pretty impressive first round showing against the All Blacks where they lost narrowly 16-20, but their record in Australia will give the Wallabies some comfort. It\u2019s 13-2 on Australia soil - but concerningly one of those two wins for the Pumas came on the Gold Coast, last year. On the bright side it\u2019s a stunning return to the side after a three-year absence for Christian Lealiifano - who has battled cancer to return to the top. We wish him the very best. Plenty of talking points - we\u2019ll delve into those shortly - in the interim, get the kettle on, pull out the fluffy robe. It\u2019s live Rugby Championship action - all here as part of your Saturday Sportwatch!",

      "bodyText": "Jane Austen novels are not known for scenes of nude men jumping into the sea or secret sex acts between lovers in forests. But for the screenwriter Andrew Davies, who is transforming Austen\u2019s final, incomplete novel, Sanditon, into a TV series, it would be a shame not to add them in. \u201cI aim to please myself when writing these things,\u201d Davies said at a preview screening, according to the BBC. \u201cI write something that I would like to watch and I suppose the sexing it up thing comes in fairly naturally.\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s not there I feel, well, that\u2019s a shame \u2013 let\u2019s put some in. I like to write it and I like to watch it,\u201d the Telegraph reported him as saying. Austen wrote the first dozen chapters of Sanditon in 1817 before she died from illness later that year. The story centres on a young woman who moves to the eponymously named sleepy village where she meets a man who is attempting to turn Sanditon into a fashionable resort. It was previously described as being \u201cnotable for its unprecedentedly forthright treatment of sexuality\u201d, and 82-year-old Davies \u2013 who has previously worked on adaptations of War and Peace, Les Mis\u00e9rables and Pride and Prejudice \u2013 admitted he used all the material from Austen\u2019s \u201cfragment\u201d in the first half of the first episode. \u201cThere\u2019s more male nudity these days and pulling back on female nudity,\u201d he said. \u201cFemale nudity can be a contentious area so one feels comfortable not [including it]. But maybe the pendulum might swing back.\u201d One section from the novel in which two characters appear \u201cclosely engaged in gentle conversation\u201d has been turned into a sex scene. Another includes a sex act in the woods. Davies previously said adapting the unfinished work was a \u201cprivilege and a thrill\u201d and that it would feature \u201ca spirited young heroine, a couple of entrepreneurial brothers, some dodgy financial dealings, a West Indian heiress and quite a bit of nude bathing\u201d. Sanditon features an ensemble cast including Rose Williams, Theo James, Anne Reid and Kris Marshall, and the screenwriter said the contents of many of the scenes were decided collectively. \u201cIt was very much a team job,\u201d Davies said. \u201cWe just sat around talking and thinking and saying: \u2018Dare we do that? Yeah!\u2019\u201d \u201cSome period stuff can be quite dour and worthy and this is witty and lustful and lascivious,\u201d said Marshall. \u201cSanditon is a place where anything goes.\u201d Sanditon will air on ITV in the autumn.",

The recipient of his intense (although, he tells himself, platonic) attention is a 16-year-old girl, Penelope Gatson, a patient at Boulder River School and Hospital in Colorado, where the physician fondly known as \u201cDr Ed\u201d works with the \u201cdevelopmentally disabled\u201d. Most of the inmates have severe learning difficulties, but Penelope is a near-genius, detained due to severe epilepsy, which back then was often treated through institutionalisation.</p> <p>The enlightened doctor believes that the teenager might be returned to live and work in the community through \u201cbehavioural modifications\u201d. As the major change in Penelope\u2019s regime involves Dr Ed staying ever later at the institution to monitor her, this puts pressure on the 36-year-old\u2019s marriage to Laura, an underachieving painter who moved reluctantly to the Rockies.</p> <p>With these central characters, Reeves, whose rural 1920s-set debut <em>Work Like Any Other</em> was longlisted for the 2016 Man Booker prize, efficiently sets up a psychological triangle that suggests two cars speeding in opposite directions towards someone crossing a road.

      "body": "<h2>Norman Foster</h2> <p><strong>Amenity </strong><strong>centre and </strong><strong>passenger </strong><strong>terminal for Fred Olsen, Millwall </strong><strong>docks, London, 1969-70</strong><br>I met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/richard-rogers\" title=\"\">Richard Rogers</a> in the early 60s at Yale School of Architecture in the US, where we were both studying for our master\u2019s. We got on well and combined forces to form Team 4, with Wendy Cheeseman and her sister Georgie Walton, who was the only registered architect at the firm. Wendy and I married and, after four years, we set up Foster Associates in her bedsit. It was 1967: there were no associates and no projects.</p> <p>A part-time architecture student worked with us. His father worked for a shipping company in Millwall docks in east London, called Fred Olsen. He knew it was looking to build an amenity centre for its workforce and I got an audience with the dock manager. I was 33.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fb3138dbb3792731dc7afc0e6e2934e6ac52c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fb3138dbb3792731dc7afc0e6e2934e6ac52c79/0_0_5616_3649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Foster at Millwall Docks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Foster at Millwall Docks: \u2018The dock manager had never met an architect before. He gave me three weeks to come up with a proposal.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The facilities at the Port of London were horrific. Olsen was a progressive Norwegian company: it wanted to raise conditions for its employees. I arrived early and explored the site. The dock manager had never met an architect before. He showed me some existing designs. As the conversation went on, I began to raise questions \u2013 not just about the building, but about how the entire operation worked. In the end, he agreed to give me three weeks to come up with a proposal.</p> <p>Olsen\u2019s ships combined trade with holiday cruises, carrying passengers and freight in the same vessel. I saw that a similar strategy could be used to bring dock workers and managers together under one roof. I identified a narrow plot between two sheds on the waterfront. I put the dockers\u2019 amenities on the ground floor and offices for administrative staff and management on the floor above.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33d0024d7d9d0b57ccf828ba74cd4e20c8d3a882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d0024d7d9d0b57ccf828ba74cd4e20c8d3a882/1907_928_1725_1182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Norman Foster sketch of his 1969 project, drawn on a lamp-post for photographer Michael Franke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Foster sketch of his 1969 project, drawn on a lamp-post for photographer Michael Franke</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put foul-mouthed dockers next to secretaries,\u201d was the immediate response. I had shaken everything up to such an extent that it was suggested I meet Fred Olsen himself. I argued that if you want to raise standards in the workplace, you should go beyond providing showers and toilets, and start to overcome the ingrained prejudices between management and workforce. He agreed to the project and gave us one year to deliver it.</p> <p>The building was challenging technologically as well as socially. At the time, nobody in the UK had the knowhow to produce a glass wall with high thermal performance. At my own cost, I flew to Pittsburgh to obtain a set of working drawings from a company that could make the glass. Inside, we introduced a gaming area on the ground floor: there were ping-pong tables and dart boards. Upstairs, Olsen\u2019s art collection was on the walls; this was revolutionary for an office building.</p> <p>The Olsen building was visited by the computer company IBM, which commissioned us to build <a href=\"https://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/ibm-pilot-headquarters/\" title=\"\">a temporary head office in Cosham</a>, near Portsmouth. It is now grade II-listed. Today, a concrete wall is all that remains of the Olsen site. Revisiting the location brought back some extraordinary memories. Olsen really was a bastion of hope in a desert of industrial unrest. Four years ago, my wife organised a surprise party for my 80th birthday and I found myself standing next to Fred Olsen. He said his only regret was that we didn\u2019t build more projects together.</p> <p>I am still doing versions of the same thing: building communities, whether I am designing for a Swiss village or a disadvantaged community in Odisha, India, as I am through my foundation. That has remained a constant, since that very first commission.</p> <h2>Thomas Heatherwick</h2> <p><strong>Harvey Nichols, London </strong><strong>fashion </strong><strong>week window displays, 1997</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e30e43372d3f40cd6a92a8b95dde92fa663125a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e30e43372d3f40cd6a92a8b95dde92fa663125a/0_161_5616_3352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Heatherwick with the original store model for Harvey Nichols\" width=\"1000\" height=\"597\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Heatherwick with the original store model, a \u2018ginormous polystyrene and aeroply structure\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>I met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/terence-conran\" title=\"\">Terence Conran</a> in my final year at the Royal College of Art, in 1994. He had come to give a talk and decided to buy a piece from my design degree show \u2013 a gazebo made from birch ply \u2013 for his back garden. He then asked me to design an interior display for the Conran Shop, so I made a layered structure from a kilometre of cardboard that displayed hundreds of kitchen items. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/21/mary-portas-interview-it-was-a-question-of-how-do-i-want-to-work-as-a-woman\" title=\"\">Mary Portas</a>, who worked for Harvey Nichols at the time, saw it and asked if I could design a window display at the department store for London fashion week 1997. I was 27 and this was my first proper public project.</p> <p>When you think of a window display, you automatically think: well, there is a window; what shall I put behind it? But I\u2019ve always found it interesting to try to take a step further back. I thought maybe I could do something more engaging, more dynamic. I didn\u2019t want to make something that was imprisoned behind glass, so focused instead on the masonry between the windows and came up with this ginormous polystyrene and aeroply structure that weaved between the windows and the building.</p> <p>I presented the idea to Mary, thinking she would say no. Everyone who saw the plan thought it would be impossible to get the permissions. But Mary was up for it. I soon discovered that, when you try to do something different, people want to be involved. We then had to find a way of stretching our minuscule budget to get this thing built. There was a team of us working for \u00a33 an hour (about \u00a35.60 today) in a vast studio in east London, including a couple of stone carvers from St Paul\u2019s cathedral and a DJ who walked past and asked if he could help. It was 1997, so computer-aided design wasn\u2019t really available. I had to carve this incredibly complex form into a 1:20 model that we then scaled up manually, using huge sheets of graph paper.</p> <p>I experienced a slight shudder on seeing the model again after 22 years. It was the first time I had done something so public \u2013 and there it was, suspended above people\u2019s heads on Knightsbridge. I was anxious, but in a good way: you should be scared, you should be worried. It was a great success, thank goodness \u2013 it won a D&amp;AD [Design and Art Direction] award that year. I remember sitting on a bus listening to people wonder what it was about. For me, it didn\u2019t matter if someone liked it or not. It made the street more vivid and engaging.</p> <p>Today, there are 200 people working at my studio; we don\u2019t build things ourselves any more, but we still try to inspire curiosity in the public. The Harvey Nichols window display took a year from idea to installation. Right now, we are designing <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/13/heatherwick-studio-kpf-kohn-pedersen-fox-sinapore-changi-airport-terminal-five/\" title=\"\">a new terminal at Changi airport in Singapore</a> that will take 10 years to complete. It involves billions of pounds of construction work and will endure for decades; but I feel the same strong sense of duty to the people who will experience it.</p> <p>My first public commission taught me the quality of just keeping believing, like a long-distance runner. It is easy for special things not to happen, but, occasionally, some of them do. And in order for them to happen, you must put everything of yourself into them.</p> <h2>Kate Macintosh</h2> <p><strong>Dawson\u2019s Heights, Dulwich, London, 1972</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e73710bd2d1e61e4c91d501dae907eaef58474c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e73710bd2d1e61e4c91d501dae907eaef58474c8/0_22_5423_3292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Architect Kate Macintosh at Dawson\u2019s Heights in Dulwich, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Macintosh at Dawson\u2019s Heights: \u2018Getting started felt exhilarating and terrifying.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>My father suggested I study architecture, which was a pretty advanced attitude for a man of his generation. After the second world war, he headed a department in a Scottish housing organisation; he was committed to providing decent housing for everybody, a belief we shared.</p> <p>I studied at Edinburgh School of Art from 1955 to 1961. I remember a tutor taking me to one side and saying: \u201cYoung ladies are not terribly practical. Have you thought of doing something like interior design?\u201d I am a stubborn person and I thought: I\u2019ll bloody show you. Thereafter, I paid particular attention to how my propositions would be built.</p> <p>After graduation, I worked abroad \u2013 first in Poland, then in various architects\u2019 offices in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. The whole mood in Europe was one of optimism. When I came back, I got a job with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jan/12/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Denys Lasdun</a>, working on the National Theatre. After about a year, I saw that this huge project was going to take ages to get on site. I was the most junior member of the team and I needed to get my boots dirty, sharpish, and take on a commission of my own.</p> <p>A lot of female architects start by doing private houses, but I saw it as much more challenging to design a community. I saw there was huge pressure on London\u2019s boroughs to provide housing. In 1965, at the age of 27, I took a job in the department of architecture and planning at Southwark council and, to my immense good fortune, I was immediately presented with this phenomenal site in Dulwich: Dawson\u2019s Hill.</p> <p>There was a slightly chaotic meeting where we had to present our schemes. There was one architect from Hong Kong who was proposing four tower blocks and another who was proposing a high-density, low-rise scheme. My design was two staggered ziggurats. This was a response to the specific characteristics of the site \u2013 the stupendous views to north and south and the extremely unstable ground conditions. At the extremities, the ziggurats descend from their maximum height of 12 storeys to four, reflecting the surrounding scale of suburban villas. </p> <p>Getting started felt exhilarating and terrifying. When you are young, you feel you can take on the world. The housing manager of Southwark drew up the brief, but as far as I was concerned my clients were the people on Southwark\u2019s housing list: those in most urgent need of homes.</p> <p>I devised a system that enabled one-, two- and three-bedroom homes to share the same access. My theory was that a mix of different family sizes, living next door to one another, would have more capacity to help each other out with babysitting or shopping. All of the 296 maisonettes have a private balcony; in some cases, two. On site, I remember nearly losing a boot in the sticky London clay: a clerk of works had to heave me out.</p> <p>Today, there still seems to be a good community feel there. The homes are 30% leaseholder-owned and I would like it to stay at that level. The central space remains car-free and it still feels very safe. I\u2019ve been told by residents that children from the surrounding area come there to play.</p> <p>Dawson\u2019s Heights is still the largest building I\u2019ve designed. It was completed in the mid-70s, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/07/housing-right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-data\" title=\"\">the introduction of right</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/07/housing-right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-data\" title=\"\">-to</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/07/housing-right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-data\" title=\"\">-buy</a>. After 1979, local authorities were starved of funding, including a restriction on their right to raise rents; this led to poor maintenance by Southwark during the 80s. It is now owned by a large housing association, <a href=\"https://www.shgroup.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Southern Housing Group</a>, which has invested in its maintenance. Looking back, I feel immensely grateful that my career spanned what was a golden age for the public sector.</p> <h2>Asif Khan</h2> <p><strong>West Beach </strong><strong>cafe, Littlehampton, 2008</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"91b795ea8bbb1a7d8eec29f7fc5669322cd626e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91b795ea8bbb1a7d8eec29f7fc5669322cd626e1/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Architect Asif Khan at West Beach Cafe in Littlehampton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asif Khan at West Beach cafe: \u2018I take my kids there every year.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>In my final year at architecture school, I completed a self-funded project in Brazil \u2013 a canopy kit I had designed and installed in a favela outside Recife \u2013 and was invited to give a short presentation about it at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. I put a lot of energy into that six-minute talk, because I was still a student and I was presenting alongside professionals. I thought: this might be my big break.</p> <p>Afterwards, I got an email from someone in the audience who told me I must speak to <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2014/07/25/interview-jane-wood-littlehampton-architecture-asif-khan-thomas-heatherwick-studio-weave/\" title=\"\">Jane Wood, a property developer in Littlehampton</a>, West Sussex. It was 2007 and she had just commissioned Thomas Heatherwick, a rising star, to design a cafe on the site of a fish and chip kiosk on the seafront, now known as East Beach cafe. She was creating a real buzz about the town.</p> <p>Jane and I emailed back and forth for a year; during that time, I became a father. It made me feel that anything was possible. When Heatherwick\u2019s cafe was nearing completion, Jane invited me to look at a new site on the neighbouring west beach. She picked me up from the station wearing big sunglasses and driving a white van full of catering equipment. I had this idea that we were about to arrive at a remarkable location on an unspoilt beach backed by dunes. When I got out of the van, my dreams fell into a hole. It was a grey, windy day and in front of me was a brick burger kiosk that hadn\u2019t been used for six months. Jane said she wanted to replace it with something simple, like a beach hut or a shack that served fish and chips and local ice-cream. I did some rapid growing up in those 30 minutes.</p> <p>I went back with an idea for a building that opens up to take in the weather and closes down when conditions are hostile. I brought images of agricultural structures, doll\u2019s houses, sash windows and the colour blue.</p> <p>The day before the cafe opened, we installed a light sculpture I had designed. Jane saw it and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not right for this place. You can do this in Clerkenwell, but not in Littlehampton.\u201d I was so upset, but it taught me one of the biggest lessons of my career: the responsibility you have to the people of a place.</p> <p>After West Beach cafe, the financial crisis hit. I had to start again \u2013 to get out there and exhibit work, to look for opportunities and, where there weren\u2019t any, to create them. I took on several commissions to design experimental pavilions in Singapore, Russia and South Korea. That enabled me to grow the studio. Today, we are working on projects all over the world: designing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/31/new-museum-of-london-smithfield-market-stanton-williams-asif-khan\" title=\"\">the new Museum of London</a>; converting a Soviet cinema in Almaty, Kazakhstan, into a centre for contemporary culture; and designing 6.5km of walking routes and roadways for Expo 2020 in Dubai. I want to keep this range, so we are continually forced to rethink what is best for a place. I\u2019ve bound myself to these places just as I did in Littlehampton, where I take my kids every year: the cafe is still there and it feels like home.</p> <h2>Mary Duggan</h2> <p><strong>King\u2019s Grove, Peckham, </strong><strong>London, 2008</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"167f77bcbd853ecf9b9dda26564d6da122091a9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/167f77bcbd853ecf9b9dda26564d6da122091a9e/0_371_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Architect Mary Duggan at King\u2019s Grove, Peckham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Duggan at King\u2019s Grove: \u2018I loved that it was a hidden space with a sense of history.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>This was the first house by Duggan Morris Architects, a practice I founded in 2004, when I was 33, with my then partner, Joe Morris. I had worked for Gollifer Langston Architects for five years, overseeing the build of seven schools across north London, but you are never really in complete control of a design when you are working for a practice. I was determined to be independent, as was Joe.</p> <p>Before King\u2019s Grove, Joe and I had renovated three houses and managed to accrue enough money to invest in this project \u2013 something most architects simply wouldn\u2019t be able to do now. (Our first property cost only \u00a360,000.) We were friends with an architect who had bought a small plot and got a planning application for it, but then decided he didn\u2019t want to develop the site. He sold it to us for \u00a3125,000 and we secured a self-build mortgage. It was an interesting site reached via a long lane and sliced between 10 terraced back gardens. The previous building \u2013 a plaster mould workshop \u2013 had been demolished. Originally, it would have been a Victorian laundry or milk parlour. I loved that it was a hidden space with a sense of history.</p> <p>Most architects have an idea of what their own house will look like. I was no different: a light-pink fairytale building surrounded by beautiful gardens. But from our first visit, I realised this wasn\u2019t the site for that. I wanted the house to retain the look and feel of the site. It was surrounded by brick walls and consumed by vegetation, so we designed a house in a similar brick. I\u2019ve learned to trust those first instincts.</p> <p>The design process was quite easy, because we knew what we wanted; after all, we were also \u201cthe client\u201d. I think this aspect of the project has had the greatest resonance in my subsequent career: the fact that I was also the investor, the risk-taker, the brief-writer and, ultimately, the decision-maker. As such, I am now able to empathise with clients. </p> <p>We designed the space with two thoughts in mind: to live in it as a generous two-bed and, down the line, to develop it for sale, or convert it if we wanted to expand our family. (Our daughter was born in the house.) We used inexpensive brick and spent a bit more money on joinery. The kitchen, which fits into a niche in the wall, is made from oak and stainless steel. There is a roof light in the centre of the house, while the front and back doors open up to a south-facing courtyard and a north-facing terrace.</p> <p>When Joe and I separated in 2016, Duggan Morris demerged and we had to sell the house. A friend bought it and invited me over several times, but I made up excuses. I just didn\u2019t want to go back. Then the house was sold again, to a client, who commissioned me in late 2018 to design a studio in the garden. Of course, I had to go back, even though I knew the space intimately.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t easy because, under different circumstances, I would still be living in King\u2019s Grove. In fact, I might be building an extension for myself now. But it was great to see it in really good condition. It is the sort of house in which the details don\u2019t tire, because it\u2019s made from very honest materials: brick, glass and oak. I got this strong sense that I had designed something that could stand the test of time.</p> <h2>David Chipperfield</h2> <p><strong>Private house,</strong><strong> Richmond, London, 1990</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2878e379d1c071b7e477b61db5824c4ad0868c51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2878e379d1c071b7e477b61db5824c4ad0868c51/0_147_5571_3388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Architect David Chipperfield at home of photographer Nick Knight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"608\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Chipperfield at the home of photographer Nick Knight: \u2018The whole street lobbied against it, writing to Prince Charles to try to have it stopped.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>In 1990, when I was in my mid-30s and still quite inexperienced, I was approached by the fashion photographer Nick Knight and his wife, Charlotte, to expand their London home. They were living in a postwar house that Nick\u2019s father had built. Nick wanted a studio upstairs and more space for his young family. At the time, I had a small office of four or five people and we were working with the designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/10/issey-miyake-45-years-at-the-forefront-of-fashion\" title=\"\">Issey Miyake</a> on a number of store interiors in Japan. This was my first building.</p> <p>I was excited about everything I was seeing in Japan at the time: they tend to treat the garden as part of the house. Most of Nick\u2019s neighbours spent a lot of money on their facades; we did the opposite. We concentrated on how the house and garden could connect. We created a large concrete frame that extended out from the side of the house, which had the effect of partially enclosing a courtyard garden. It also meant that the corner of the living room could be opened up, without a supporting column, framing a view into the garden, creating an outside space that feels like an indoor one.</p> <p>We ended up with a fight on our hands. The whole street lobbied against it, writing to Prince Charles to try to have it stopped. The people across the road kept their curtains drawn for a couple of years in protest. It was an introduction to conservative English taste, which was quite shocking. It wasn\u2019t that the house was too big; it was that the front didn\u2019t look like the other houses in the street. That was the worst part of the process for me. Once we started to build, it was easy by comparison.</p> <p>Designing and building houses for people is a delicate process, which is why I only take on one or two at a time. Success depends very much on how you develop a way of being personal and professional: that relationship is critical.</p> <p>This was the first time I had a central idea to my work \u2013 the idea of creating an expansive view in a suburban street \u2013 and it is a strategy I\u2019ve lived by since. The house has been part of Nick and Charlotte\u2019s life for 30 years and I think it has helped them formulate a work-life balance. Nick\u2019s work is incredibly intense and demanding, yet he is dedicated to his family. I like to think the house has played a role.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p>\u2022 This article\u2019s headline was amended on 29 July 2019 to clarify that the people featured are not all architects.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Norman Foster Amenity centre and passenger terminal for Fred Olsen, Millwall docks, London, 1969-70 I met Richard Rogers in the early 60s at Yale School of Architecture in the US, where we were both studying for our master\u2019s. We got on well and combined forces to form Team 4, with Wendy Cheeseman and her sister Georgie Walton, who was the only registered architect at the firm. Wendy and I married and, after four years, we set up Foster Associates in her bedsit. It was 1967: there were no associates and no projects. A part-time architecture student worked with us. His father worked for a shipping company in Millwall docks in east London, called Fred Olsen. He knew it was looking to build an amenity centre for its workforce and I got an audience with the dock manager. I was 33. The facilities at the Port of London were horrific. Olsen was a progressive Norwegian company: it wanted to raise conditions for its employees. I arrived early and explored the site. The dock manager had never met an architect before. He showed me some existing designs. As the conversation went on, I began to raise questions \u2013 not just about the building, but about how the entire operation worked. In the end, he agreed to give me three weeks to come up with a proposal. Olsen\u2019s ships combined trade with holiday cruises, carrying passengers and freight in the same vessel. I saw that a similar strategy could be used to bring dock workers and managers together under one roof. I identified a narrow plot between two sheds on the waterfront. I put the dockers\u2019 amenities on the ground floor and offices for administrative staff and management on the floor above. \u201cYou can\u2019t put foul-mouthed dockers next to secretaries,\u201d was the immediate response. I had shaken everything up to such an extent that it was suggested I meet Fred Olsen himself. I argued that if you want to raise standards in the workplace, you should go beyond providing showers and toilets, and start to overcome the ingrained prejudices between management and workforce. He agreed to the project and gave us one year to deliver it. The building was challenging technologically as well as socially. At the time, nobody in the UK had the knowhow to produce a glass wall with high thermal performance. At my own cost, I flew to Pittsburgh to obtain a set of working drawings from a company that could make the glass. Inside, we introduced a gaming area on the ground floor: there were ping-pong tables and dart boards. Upstairs, Olsen\u2019s art collection was on the walls; this was revolutionary for an office building. The Olsen building was visited by the computer company IBM, which commissioned us to build a temporary head office in Cosham, near Portsmouth. It is now grade II-listed. Today, a concrete wall is all that remains of the Olsen site. Revisiting the location brought back some extraordinary memories. Olsen really was a bastion of hope in a desert of industrial unrest. Four years ago, my wife organised a surprise party for my 80th birthday and I found myself standing next to Fred Olsen. He said his only regret was that we didn\u2019t build more projects together. I am still doing versions of the same thing: building communities, whether I am designing for a Swiss village or a disadvantaged community in Odisha, India, as I am through my foundation. That has remained a constant, since that very first commission. Thomas Heatherwick Harvey Nichols, London fashion week window displays, 1997 I met Terence Conran in my final year at the Royal College of Art, in 1994. He had come to give a talk and decided to buy a piece from my design degree show \u2013 a gazebo made from birch ply \u2013 for his back garden. He then asked me to design an interior display for the Conran Shop, so I made a layered structure from a kilometre of cardboard that displayed hundreds of kitchen items. Mary Portas, who worked for Harvey Nichols at the time, saw it and asked if I could design a window display at the department store for London fashion week 1997. I was 27 and this was my first proper public project. When you think of a window display, you automatically think: well, there is a window; what shall I put behind it? But I\u2019ve always found it interesting to try to take a step further back. I thought maybe I could do something more engaging, more dynamic. I didn\u2019t want to make something that was imprisoned behind glass, so focused instead on the masonry between the windows and came up with this ginormous polystyrene and aeroply structure that weaved between the windows and the building. I presented the idea to Mary, thinking she would say no. Everyone who saw the plan thought it would be impossible to get the permissions. But Mary was up for it. I soon discovered that, when you try to do something different, people want to be involved. We then had to find a way of stretching our minuscule budget to get this thing built. There was a team of us working for \u00a33 an hour (about \u00a35.60 today) in a vast studio in east London, including a couple of stone carvers from St Paul\u2019s cathedral and a DJ who walked past and asked if he could help. It was 1997, so computer-aided design wasn\u2019t really available. I had to carve this incredibly complex form into a 1:20 model that we then scaled up manually, using huge sheets of graph paper. I experienced a slight shudder on seeing the model again after 22 years. It was the first time I had done something so public \u2013 and there it was, suspended above people\u2019s heads on Knightsbridge. I was anxious, but in a good way: you should be scared, you should be worried. It was a great success, thank goodness \u2013 it won a D&amp;AD [Design and Art Direction] award that year. I remember sitting on a bus listening to people wonder what it was about. For me, it didn\u2019t matter if someone liked it or not. It made the street more vivid and engaging. Today, there are 200 people working at my studio; we don\u2019t build things ourselves any more, but we still try to inspire curiosity in the public. The Harvey Nichols window display took a year from idea to installation. Right now, we are designing a new terminal at Changi airport in Singapore that will take 10 years to complete. It involves billions of pounds of construction work and will endure for decades; but I feel the same strong sense of duty to the people who will experience it. My first public commission taught me the quality of just keeping believing, like a long-distance runner. It is easy for special things not to happen, but, occasionally, some of them do. And in order for them to happen, you must put everything of yourself into them. Kate Macintosh Dawson\u2019s Heights, Dulwich, London, 1972 My father suggested I study architecture, which was a pretty advanced attitude for a man of his generation. After the second world war, he headed a department in a Scottish housing organisation; he was committed to providing decent housing for everybody, a belief we shared. I studied at Edinburgh School of Art from 1955 to 1961. I remember a tutor taking me to one side and saying: \u201cYoung ladies are not terribly practical. Have you thought of doing something like interior design?\u201d I am a stubborn person and I thought: I\u2019ll bloody show you. Thereafter, I paid particular attention to how my propositions would be built. After graduation, I worked abroad \u2013 first in Poland, then in various architects\u2019 offices in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. The whole mood in Europe was one of optimism. When I came back, I got a job with Denys Lasdun, working on the National Theatre. After about a year, I saw that this huge project was going to take ages to get on site. I was the most junior member of the team and I needed to get my boots dirty, sharpish, and take on a commission of my own. A lot of female architects start by doing private houses, but I saw it as much more challenging to design a community. I saw there was huge pressure on London\u2019s boroughs to provide housing. In 1965, at the age of 27, I took a job in the department of architecture and planning at Southwark council and, to my immense good fortune, I was immediately presented with this phenomenal site in Dulwich: Dawson\u2019s Hill. There was a slightly chaotic meeting where we had to present our schemes. There was one architect from Hong Kong who was proposing four tower blocks and another who was proposing a high-density, low-rise scheme. My design was two staggered ziggurats. This was a response to the specific characteristics of the site \u2013 the stupendous views to north and south and the extremely unstable ground conditions. At the extremities, the ziggurats descend from their maximum height of 12 storeys to four, reflecting the surrounding scale of suburban villas. Getting started felt exhilarating and terrifying. When you are young, you feel you can take on the world. The housing manager of Southwark drew up the brief, but as far as I was concerned my clients were the people on Southwark\u2019s housing list: those in most urgent need of homes. I devised a system that enabled one-, two- and three-bedroom homes to share the same access. My theory was that a mix of different family sizes, living next door to one another, would have more capacity to help each other out with babysitting or shopping. All of the 296 maisonettes have a private balcony; in some cases, two. On site, I remember nearly losing a boot in the sticky London clay: a clerk of works had to heave me out. Today, there still seems to be a good community feel there. The homes are 30% leaseholder-owned and I would like it to stay at that level. The central space remains car-free and it still feels very safe. I\u2019ve been told by residents that children from the surrounding area come there to play. Dawson\u2019s Heights is still the largest building I\u2019ve designed. It was completed in the mid-70s, before the introduction of right-to-buy. After 1979, local authorities were starved of funding, including a restriction on their right to raise rents; this led to poor maintenance by Southwark during the 80s. It is now owned by a large housing association, Southern Housing Group, which has invested in its maintenance. Looking back, I feel immensely grateful that my career spanned what was a golden age for the public sector. Asif Khan West Beach cafe, Littlehampton, 2008 In my final year at architecture school, I completed a self-funded project in Brazil \u2013 a canopy kit I had designed and installed in a favela outside Recife \u2013 and was invited to give a short presentation about it at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. I put a lot of energy into that six-minute talk, because I was still a student and I was presenting alongside professionals. I thought: this might be my big break. Afterwards, I got an email from someone in the audience who told me I must speak to Jane Wood, a property developer in Littlehampton, West Sussex. It was 2007 and she had just commissioned Thomas Heatherwick, a rising star, to design a cafe on the site of a fish and chip kiosk on the seafront, now known as East Beach cafe. She was creating a real buzz about the town. Jane and I emailed back and forth for a year; during that time, I became a father. It made me feel that anything was possible. When Heatherwick\u2019s cafe was nearing completion, Jane invited me to look at a new site on the neighbouring west beach. She picked me up from the station wearing big sunglasses and driving a white van full of catering equipment. I had this idea that we were about to arrive at a remarkable location on an unspoilt beach backed by dunes. When I got out of the van, my dreams fell into a hole. It was a grey, windy day and in front of me was a brick burger kiosk that hadn\u2019t been used for six months. Jane said she wanted to replace it with something simple, like a beach hut or a shack that served fish and chips and local ice-cream. I did some rapid growing up in those 30 minutes. I went back with an idea for a building that opens up to take in the weather and closes down when conditions are hostile. I brought images of agricultural structures, doll\u2019s houses, sash windows and the colour blue. The day before the cafe opened, we installed a light sculpture I had designed. Jane saw it and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not right for this place. You can do this in Clerkenwell, but not in Littlehampton.\u201d I was so upset, but it taught me one of the biggest lessons of my career: the responsibility you have to the people of a place. After West Beach cafe, the financial crisis hit. I had to start again \u2013 to get out there and exhibit work, to look for opportunities and, where there weren\u2019t any, to create them. I took on several commissions to design experimental pavilions in Singapore, Russia and South Korea. That enabled me to grow the studio. Today, we are working on projects all over the world: designing the new Museum of London; converting a Soviet cinema in Almaty, Kazakhstan, into a centre for contemporary culture; and designing 6.5km of walking routes and roadways for Expo 2020 in Dubai. I want to keep this range, so we are continually forced to rethink what is best for a place. I\u2019ve bound myself to these places just as I did in Littlehampton, where I take my kids every year: the cafe is still there and it feels like home. Mary Duggan King\u2019s Grove, Peckham, London, 2008 This was the first house by Duggan Morris Architects, a practice I founded in 2004, when I was 33, with my then partner, Joe Morris. I had worked for Gollifer Langston Architects for five years, overseeing the build of seven schools across north London, but you are never really in complete control of a design when you are working for a practice. I was determined to be independent, as was Joe. Before King\u2019s Grove, Joe and I had renovated three houses and managed to accrue enough money to invest in this project \u2013 something most architects simply wouldn\u2019t be able to do now. (Our first property cost only \u00a360,000.) We were friends with an architect who had bought a small plot and got a planning application for it, but then decided he didn\u2019t want to develop the site. He sold it to us for \u00a3125,000 and we secured a self-build mortgage. It was an interesting site reached via a long lane and sliced between 10 terraced back gardens. The previous building \u2013 a plaster mould workshop \u2013 had been demolished. Originally, it would have been a Victorian laundry or milk parlour. I loved that it was a hidden space with a sense of history. Most architects have an idea of what their own house will look like. I was no different: a light-pink fairytale building surrounded by beautiful gardens. But from our first visit, I realised this wasn\u2019t the site for that. I wanted the house to retain the look and feel of the site. It was surrounded by brick walls and consumed by vegetation, so we designed a house in a similar brick. I\u2019ve learned to trust those first instincts. The design process was quite easy, because we knew what we wanted; after all, we were also \u201cthe client\u201d. I think this aspect of the project has had the greatest resonance in my subsequent career: the fact that I was also the investor, the risk-taker, the brief-writer and, ultimately, the decision-maker. As such, I am now able to empathise with clients. We designed the space with two thoughts in mind: to live in it as a generous two-bed and, down the line, to develop it for sale, or convert it if we wanted to expand our family. (Our daughter was born in the house.) We used inexpensive brick and spent a bit more money on joinery. The kitchen, which fits into a niche in the wall, is made from oak and stainless steel. There is a roof light in the centre of the house, while the front and back doors open up to a south-facing courtyard and a north-facing terrace. When Joe and I separated in 2016, Duggan Morris demerged and we had to sell the house. A friend bought it and invited me over several times, but I made up excuses. I just didn\u2019t want to go back. Then the house was sold again, to a client, who commissioned me in late 2018 to design a studio in the garden. Of course, I had to go back, even though I knew the space intimately. It wasn\u2019t easy because, under different circumstances, I would still be living in King\u2019s Grove. In fact, I might be building an extension for myself now. But it was great to see it in really good condition. It is the sort of house in which the details don\u2019t tire, because it\u2019s made from very honest materials: brick, glass and oak. I got this strong sense that I had designed something that could stand the test of time. David Chipperfield Private house, Richmond, London, 1990 In 1990, when I was in my mid-30s and still quite inexperienced, I was approached by the fashion photographer Nick Knight and his wife, Charlotte, to expand their London home. They were living in a postwar house that Nick\u2019s father had built. Nick wanted a studio upstairs and more space for his young family. At the time, I had a small office of four or five people and we were working with the designer Issey Miyake on a number of store interiors in Japan. This was my first building. I was excited about everything I was seeing in Japan at the time: they tend to treat the garden as part of the house. Most of Nick\u2019s neighbours spent a lot of money on their facades; we did the opposite. We concentrated on how the house and garden could connect. We created a large concrete frame that extended out from the side of the house, which had the effect of partially enclosing a courtyard garden. It also meant that the corner of the living room could be opened up, without a supporting column, framing a view into the garden, creating an outside space that feels like an indoor one. We ended up with a fight on our hands. The whole street lobbied against it, writing to Prince Charles to try to have it stopped. The people across the road kept their curtains drawn for a couple of years in protest. It was an introduction to conservative English taste, which was quite shocking. It wasn\u2019t that the house was too big; it was that the front didn\u2019t look like the other houses in the street. That was the worst part of the process for me. Once we started to build, it was easy by comparison. Designing and building houses for people is a delicate process, which is why I only take on one or two at a time. Success depends very much on how you develop a way of being personal and professional: that relationship is critical. This was the first time I had a central idea to my work \u2013 the idea of creating an expansive view in a suburban street \u2013 and it is a strategy I\u2019ve lived by since. The house has been part of Nick and Charlotte\u2019s life for 30 years and I think it has helped them formulate a work-life balance. Nick\u2019s work is incredibly intense and demanding, yet he is dedicated to his family. I like to think the house has played a role. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication). \u2022 This article\u2019s headline was amended on 29 July 2019 to clarify that the people featured are not all architects.",

      "bodyText": "It sounds unpleasant, even painful. But as they ponder the linked challenges posed by China and Russia, Pentagon strategists are earnestly discussing whether Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s famously athletic leader, will perform a \u201creverse Nixon\u201d. This is neither a daring swivel on the parallel bars nor an unusual sexual position. At issue is whether Putin will emulate the 37th US president, Richard Nixon, whose groundbreaking 1972 cold war outreach to China tilted the strategic balance in America\u2019s favour. \u201cIf Putin performed a \u201creverse Nixon\u201d and played his own version of the \u201cChina card\u201d, the world system, and American influence in it, would be completely upended,\u201d a recent Pentagon study of Russian strategic intentions warned. A China-Russia axis is not a new idea but the question is gaining in topicality. Look no further than last week\u2019s aerial confrontation over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. For the first time, China and Russia joined forces to mount an air patrol using long-range bombers and spy planes. South Korea and Japan separately scrambled fighter jets to intercept the intruders, saying their sovereign airspace and air defence zones had been violated \u2013 which Moscow and Beijing denied. South Korean pilots fired almost 400 warning shots. The incident was alarming, militarily speaking, but it also highlights burgeoning security, economic and diplomatic collaboration between two major powers both bitterly at odds with Donald Trump\u2019s America. China\u2019s expanding global influence was once viewed by Washington as healthy competition. Now it\u2019s seen as a threat. Flashpoints include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Beijing\u2019s militarisation of the South China Sea. Trump\u2019s punitive trade war has exacerbated China\u2019s economic slowdown and further soured ties. Russia is in the doghouse over its interference in the 2016 US election and other \u201cgray zone\u201d cyber ops. Moscow\u2019s actions in Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, and a reviving nuclear arms race, have also caused tension. In contrast, China and Russia agree on many issues, principally the obsolescence of liberal democracy and the attractions of authoritarian governance. When Putin hosted Xi Jinping in Moscow in June, they celebrated a 30% year-on-year increase in bilateral trade and signed various cooperation deals. Russia is selling China its latest weaponry, including S400 ground-to-air missiles and SU-35 jets. Bigger, more frequent joint military exercises are planned, matching their diplomatic coordination in the UN security council. Putin has met Xi about 30 times since 2013. Xi calls him his \u201cbest and bosom friend\u201d. All this backslapping bonhomie is deeply troubling, not just for Pentagon war-gamers but also for western allies across east Asia concerned by deteriorating security. Japan, resentful of Trump\u2019s complaints over burden-sharing, is on the frontline of the nuclear standoff with Chinese-backed North Korea. Trump\u2019s two summit meetings with North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, have failed to produce any movement on denuclearisation. Now things are beginning to unravel. On Thursday, Pyongyang resumed ballistic missile testing. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, while pursuing improved relations with China, also wants his country to be more self-reliant militarily. But he failed to secure a mandate to change Tokyo\u2019s pacifist constitution in last weekend\u2019s Upper House elections. That has tied his hands \u2013 which suits China and Russia just fine. Compared with Japan, South Korea\u2019s relations with China are less encumbered by historical baggage. But the large American military presence there is a constant irritant, symbolised by last year\u2019s fierce row with Beijing over the US deployment of new missile defences. In Seoul, too, Trump\u2019s whingeing about unfair trade and defence costs has raised questions about American reliability. At the same time, his ego-trip summitry has detracted from President Moon Jae-in\u2019s more considered peace efforts, which are now under fire from the North. A lack of consistent US leadership and regional strategic vision is handing Beijing some easy \u201cwins\u201d. The Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, lamely agreed this year to shelve bilateral territorial and fishing disputes under pressure from Xi. Cambodia has reportedly agreed to host a Chinese naval base, although it officially denies it. Meanwhile China, sensing division and weakness, is noisily amplifying its longstanding objections to US (and British) geopolitical \u201cmeddling\u201d. After more violence in Hong Kong last week, it pointedly told the US to remove its \u201cblack hand\u201d. Xi is simultaneously ramping up pressure on US-protected Taiwan, another supposedly wayward island. In a defence white paper published last week, Beijing vowed to \u201cresolutely defeat anyone attempting to separate Taiwan from China and safeguard national unity at all costs\u201d. This sterner-than-usual warning follows Washington\u2019s decision to supply $2.2bn (\u00a31.8bn) in arms to Taiwan and a heightened US naval presence in the Taiwan Strait. Yet despite these American moves, Taiwan, in common with other rattled regional friends and allies, doubts Trump can be counted on . The white paper\u2019s verdict was defiantly hostile. Trump\u2019s America, it said, was \u201cundermining global strategic stability\u201d. Yet China was not daunted. Defence modernisation would be completed by 2035, thereby \u201cfully transforming [China\u2019s military] into world-class forces\u201d. That\u2019s the looming challenge facing the region and post-1945 US strategic dominance. Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d is all but forgotten, while Trump\u2019s approach lacks coherence. Factor in a growing China-Russia alliance and it is easy to see why Pentagon planners worry. Perhaps their best hope is that Russia, an economically weaker partner whose interests do not always align with Beijing\u2019s, will ultimately rebuff the embrace of its domineering new bedfellow. What\u2019s needed now is a \u201creverse Putin\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>So, you\u2019re off on your hols, then? Remembered to leave an out-of-office message on your email? Ah, yes. \u201cJohn Stephens will be out of the office from 1st August for two weeks. If you need an urgent response to a query, please contact \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2013 straightforward and informative. But \u2013 how can I put this, John? \u2013 isn\u2019t it just a little bit prosaic? Don\u2019t you itch to generate a frisson of envy among your colleagues while you\u2019re not hewing at the coalface? Boost your image? What might be called induced OOO envy? If so, you\u2019re going to have to do a damn sight better than the above. Because telling the truth on an OOO is so pass\u00e9 these days. No, what\u2019s required is something altogether more ambitious, more global.</p> <p>For example, I have an old friend who, so exasperated by one of his friends forever jetting off to Las Vegas to cover another world championship boxing bout, would retaliate with: \u201cAm presently in the Virgin Islands, covering the world windsurfing championships.\u201d The fact that he was down at his local swimming pool with his granddaughter was neither here nor there. After all, your friends can presume too much on your good and forgiving nature, can they not?</p> <p>But such OOO one-upmanship is strictly in the foothills. And from here on in I feel I must finesse or redact with a heavy censor\u2019s pen to protect the identity of those who otherwise you would laugh your socks off at for being quite so, ahem, up themselves. Take, for example, the following: \u201cFor book inquiries, please contact my agent \u2026 \u201d; \u201cFor live events, please contact \u2026 \u201d; \u201cFor broadcast requests or personal brand inquiries, please contact \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>This pales into insignificance compared with the following: \u201cInterviews or events, please can you email my publicist \u2026\u201d; \u201cFilm/TV projects, please can you email my film/TV agent\u201d; \u201cBooks: please can you email my book agent\u201d; \u201cJournalism/essay commissions: I promise I\u2019ll get back to you\u201d; \u201cSending me a book, well, hey now, I love a good book. Please send to \u2026 \u201d. Pretty ripe stuff, you\u2019ll agree, and surely someone with a sense of their own importance and place in the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Telling the truth on an OOO is so pass\u00e9 \u2013 what\u2019s required is something altogether more ambitious, more global.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, I\u2019m sure that both of the senders of the above are perfectly honourable and upstanding people, though perhaps a smidgen of self-irony wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. But hey, it\u2019s their lives and was I not suggesting that OOO message leavers should up their game? So no cavils there (well, just a scintilla of one).</p> <p>But what do you make of someone who, when composing such a message, veers completely off-message, as it were? A little research turned up the following OOO: \u201cImpossible is a big word thrown about by small men who find it easier to live in the world they\u2019ve been given than explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It\u2019s an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It\u2019s a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently, this is a quote from Muhammad Ali, but quite what it\u2019s doing on an OOO is beyond me. The person who left this is quite unfit for further consideration. In fact, on due reflection, John Stephens\u2019s somewhat terse effort gets my vote.</p> <p>But, even taking full cognisance of the monumental effort that must have gone into creating such messages as the above, and thanking heaven for the all-too-rare witty message \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m having an out of office experience\u201d (full marks for that one), they frankly pale into insignificance when you consider a message that comes long before the advent of email and social media: \u201cGon out Backson Bisy Backson.\u201d Thank you, Christopher Robin. That, pithily, seems to tick all boxes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So, you\u2019re off on your hols, then? Remembered to leave an out-of-office message on your email? Ah, yes. \u201cJohn Stephens will be out of the office from 1st August for two weeks. If you need an urgent response to a query, please contact \u2026 \u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree that there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2013 straightforward and informative. But \u2013 how can I put this, John? \u2013 isn\u2019t it just a little bit prosaic? Don\u2019t you itch to generate a frisson of envy among your colleagues while you\u2019re not hewing at the coalface? Boost your image? What might be called induced OOO envy? If so, you\u2019re going to have to do a damn sight better than the above. Because telling the truth on an OOO is so pass\u00e9 these days. No, what\u2019s required is something altogether more ambitious, more global. For example, I have an old friend who, so exasperated by one of his friends forever jetting off to Las Vegas to cover another world championship boxing bout, would retaliate with: \u201cAm presently in the Virgin Islands, covering the world windsurfing championships.\u201d The fact that he was down at his local swimming pool with his granddaughter was neither here nor there. After all, your friends can presume too much on your good and forgiving nature, can they not? But such OOO one-upmanship is strictly in the foothills. And from here on in I feel I must finesse or redact with a heavy censor\u2019s pen to protect the identity of those who otherwise you would laugh your socks off at for being quite so, ahem, up themselves. Take, for example, the following: \u201cFor book inquiries, please contact my agent \u2026 \u201d; \u201cFor live events, please contact \u2026 \u201d; \u201cFor broadcast requests or personal brand inquiries, please contact \u2026 \u201d This pales into insignificance compared with the following: \u201cInterviews or events, please can you email my publicist \u2026\u201d; \u201cFilm/TV projects, please can you email my film/TV agent\u201d; \u201cBooks: please can you email my book agent\u201d; \u201cJournalism/essay commissions: I promise I\u2019ll get back to you\u201d; \u201cSending me a book, well, hey now, I love a good book. Please send to \u2026 \u201d. Pretty ripe stuff, you\u2019ll agree, and surely someone with a sense of their own importance and place in the world. Now, I\u2019m sure that both of the senders of the above are perfectly honourable and upstanding people, though perhaps a smidgen of self-irony wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. But hey, it\u2019s their lives and was I not suggesting that OOO message leavers should up their game? So no cavils there (well, just a scintilla of one). But what do you make of someone who, when composing such a message, veers completely off-message, as it were? A little research turned up the following OOO: \u201cImpossible is a big word thrown about by small men who find it easier to live in the world they\u2019ve been given than explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It\u2019s an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It\u2019s a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.\u201d Apparently, this is a quote from Muhammad Ali, but quite what it\u2019s doing on an OOO is beyond me. The person who left this is quite unfit for further consideration. In fact, on due reflection, John Stephens\u2019s somewhat terse effort gets my vote. But, even taking full cognisance of the monumental effort that must have gone into creating such messages as the above, and thanking heaven for the all-too-rare witty message \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m having an out of office experience\u201d (full marks for that one), they frankly pale into insignificance when you consider a message that comes long before the advent of email and social media: \u201cGon out Backson Bisy Backson.\u201d Thank you, Christopher Robin. That, pithily, seems to tick all boxes.",

Glyndebourne\u2019s Festival Opera\u2019s new production \u2013 confining the whole piece within an opulent Viennese belle epoch hotel \u2013 is spectacular to look at but disappointingly runs scared from any display of solemnity, reducing so many key moments to operatic episodes of <em>MasterChef</em> or <em>Bake Off</em>.</p> <p>The French-Canadian directing and design duo <a href=\"https://www.barbedoucet.com/\" title=\"\">Barbe &amp; Doucet</a>, making their Glyndebourne debut, conjure their hotel from a dozen beautifully drawn backdrops, in the manner of a toy theatre. The Queen of the Night manages the hotel, while her nemesis, Sarastro, is head chef, down in his cellar-kitchen-temple. The Three Boys are feisty little bellhops. Hero Tamino enters in his pyjamas, dreaming of being chased by a dragon made of plates and soup tureens. Quite why he would agree to rescue the Queen of the Night\u2019s daughter Pamina from Sarastro when all the queen has to do is pop down in the lift and fire him seems not to have occurred to anyone.</p> <p>It would appear Barbe &amp; Doucet formed the hotel idea and then shoehorned the opera to fit, regardless of the plot or, more important, the score. Thus the birdcatcher Papageno, singing of charming the birds from the trees, is made the hotel laundryman, delivering feather pillows; Sarastro\u2019s high priests are ranks of pastry chefs whose toques light up when they perform their masonic rituals; Tamino and Pamina\u2019s trials of fire and water are nothing more arduous than knocking out a casserole and doing the washing up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e1a12c6c341f96a622604d5f16a9219d93b94fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e1a12c6c341f96a622604d5f16a9219d93b94fa/0_0_4488_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pamina (Sofia Fomina), First Priest (Martin Snell), Sarastro (Brindley Sherratt), Speaker (Michael Kraus), Second Priest (Thomas Atkins) and Glyndebourne Chorus in Die Zauberfl\u00f6te.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pamina (Sofia Fomina), First Priest (Martin Snell), Sarastro (Brindley Sherratt), Speaker (Michael Kraus), Second Priest (Thomas Atkins) and Glyndebourne Chorus in Die Zauberfl\u00f6te.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Cooper/\u00a9 Glyndebourne Productions Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And puppetry spoils rather than informs some fine set pieces. When Papageno discovers Pamina and they sing the best duet in the piece, Bei M\u00e4nnern, welche Liebe f\u00fchlen, puppeteers dance around them with half-formed mannequins as partners, and the duet of the Two Armed Men \u2013 usually a highly mystical moment \u2013 is sung by two priest chefs steering two giant robots made of kitchen hardware.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.carolinewettergreen.com/\" title=\"\">Caroline Wettergreen</a>, as Queen of the Night, adds some spectacular octaves to her already stratospheric opening aria, and always reliable <a href=\"https://www.brindleysherratt.com/\" title=\"\">Brindley Sherratt</a> manages to maintain his dignity as Sarastro, even when an orange lightbulb comes on in his hat, but otherwise the singing is undistinguished. Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger (Papageno) is engaging enough, but Barbe &amp; Doucet\u2019s restoration of the entire dialogue drags him down in a sea of verbiage just when you want the action to move on, and having him playfully stuffed in an oven seems heedless of the darkness that was to fall over 20th-century Austria.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five) <br>Proms 1 &amp; 7 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br>L\u2019arlesiana \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br>Il segreto di Susanna/Iolanta \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 <br>Die Zauberfl\u00f6te \u2605\u2605\u2605</em></p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0006vs2/bbc-proms-2019-first-night-of-the-proms-part-two\">First Night</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m00071mm/bbc-proms-2019-schumann-schoenberg-and-mozart\">Prom 7</a> are both available to watch on BBC iPlayer. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/proms\" title=\"\">The Proms continue until 14 September</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://operahollandpark.com/productions/larlesiana/\" title=\"\">L\u2019arlesiana</a> and <a href=\"https://operahollandpark.com/productions/double-bill/\" title=\"\">Il segreto di Susanna/Iolanta</a> are in rep at Opera Holland Park, London, until 2 August/3 August respectively</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/die-zauberflote/\" title=\"\">Die Zauberfl\u00f6te</a> is in rep at Glyndebourne, East Sussex, until 24 Aug</p>",

Glyndebourne\u2019s Festival Opera\u2019s new production \u2013 confining the whole piece within an opulent Viennese belle epoch hotel \u2013 is spectacular to look at but disappointingly runs scared from any display of solemnity, reducing so many key moments to operatic episodes of MasterChef or Bake Off. The French-Canadian directing and design duo Barbe &amp; Doucet, making their Glyndebourne debut, conjure their hotel from a dozen beautifully drawn backdrops, in the manner of a toy theatre. The Queen of the Night manages the hotel, while her nemesis, Sarastro, is head chef, down in his cellar-kitchen-temple. The Three Boys are feisty little bellhops. Hero Tamino enters in his pyjamas, dreaming of being chased by a dragon made of plates and soup tureens. Quite why he would agree to rescue the Queen of the Night\u2019s daughter Pamina from Sarastro when all the queen has to do is pop down in the lift and fire him seems not to have occurred to anyone. It would appear Barbe &amp; Doucet formed the hotel idea and then shoehorned the opera to fit, regardless of the plot or, more important, the score. Thus the birdcatcher Papageno, singing of charming the birds from the trees, is made the hotel laundryman, delivering feather pillows; Sarastro\u2019s high priests are ranks of pastry chefs whose toques light up when they perform their masonic rituals; Tamino and Pamina\u2019s trials of fire and water are nothing more arduous than knocking out a casserole and doing the washing up. And puppetry spoils rather than informs some fine set pieces. When Papageno discovers Pamina and they sing the best duet in the piece, Bei M\u00e4nnern, welche Liebe f\u00fchlen, puppeteers dance around them with half-formed mannequins as partners, and the duet of the Two Armed Men \u2013 usually a highly mystical moment \u2013 is sung by two priest chefs steering two giant robots made of kitchen hardware. Caroline Wettergreen, as Queen of the Night, adds some spectacular octaves to her already stratospheric opening aria, and always reliable Brindley Sherratt manages to maintain his dignity as Sarastro, even when an orange lightbulb comes on in his hat, but otherwise the singing is undistinguished. Bj\u00f6rn B\u00fcrger (Papageno) is engaging enough, but Barbe &amp; Doucet\u2019s restoration of the entire dialogue drags him down in a sea of verbiage just when you want the action to move on, and having him playfully stuffed in an oven seems heedless of the darkness that was to fall over 20th-century Austria.

      "body": "<p>In the late 1990s the Welsh-Indian writer Tishani Doshi was on a postgraduate writing course at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. A literary scout came to visit and asked to meet her. \u201cThis was not long after <em>The God of Small Things</em>,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEverybody was looking for the next Arundhati Roy.\u201d The scout was pretty direct. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re a poet. But you should be writing novels.\u2019 I was actually quite offended. And dismayed that the publishing industry just wanted to re-order and replace. I had no plans then to write fiction. In fact, years later, when I wanted the larger canvas a novel can provide, I eventually did. But that instinctive loyalty to poetry never left me. I had discovered this thing and wanted to figure out how to do it. How to be a poet. I\u2019m still attempting how to figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>Doshi\u2019s loyalty was soon repaid. Her debut book, <em>Countries of the Body</em>, won the 2006 Forward prize for best first collection. Her first \u201cproper\u201d public poetry reading \u2013 as opposed to bookshop audiences swelled by \u201cblood or friendship\u201d, as she once put it \u2013 was at the Hay festival that year. She was on stage in front of 1,200 people, reading alongside Seamus Heaney and Margaret Atwood. \u201cIt was pretty stellar,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut that is the great thing about poetry. One minute you\u2019re doing that and the next you\u2019re reading to five people in a basement. And both events are always worthwhile.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since, Doshi has completed two more poetry collections, most recently the 2018 Ted Hughes prize-shortlisted <em>Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods</em> (Bloodaxe). Her third novel, <em>Small Days and Nights </em>(Bloomsbury), was published earlier this year. But while there have always been writers who produce both poetry and novels, what makes Doshi\u2019s subsequent career unique is her additional deployment of another mode of creative expression: dance. She took up the discipline in her mid-20s, when most dancers are starting to think about retirement, and in the two decades since has explored a set of \u201coverlapping concerns\u201d through verse, prose and movement. Her first two poetry collections were dedicated to her Indian dance mentor, the influential choreographer and feminist thinker Chandralekha, who died in 2006.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of the body, usually the female body, has always been central to my work,\u201d Doshi explains. \u201cMy precise preoccupations might change over time, but I\u2019ve always been interested in how the body connects to the wider world, which is then linked to questions of belonging, and what is meant by concepts such as \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018elsewhere\u2019. In particular I have long been thinking about what it means to live as a woman in India. My most recent novel and poetry collection were written at the same time and share certain themes \u2013 although they are handled differently \u2013 in relation to women. Most obviously around safety and danger.\u201d</p> <p>The title poem of <em>Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods</em> conjures back to life Indian women who have been brutalised and murdered. Their ghosts, and their stories, refusing to be forgotten: \u201cGirls are coming / out of the woods, clearing the ground / to scatter their stories. Even those girls / found naked in ditches and wells, / those forgotten in neglected attics, / and buried in riverbeds like sediments / from a different century\u201d. After she completed the poem one of her friends, Monika Ghurde, was raped and murdered, the details then salaciously picked over in the media. Doshi dedicated the poem to her as another act of reclamation. She also asked the percussionist Luca Nardon to compose a score for the words to which she choreographed a dance. \u201cIt seemed to lend itself to using the body,\u201d she says. \u201cTo begin I just stand there, my two feet spread apart. There is a rootedness to the earth as the women start to come up from the mud, from out of the forests in their states of mutilation. Poetry is so wonderfully elastic and open to collaboration. Here the physicality and the poem speak to each other to add another layer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd3f9c014d9cf8289c2f4db01bedc600c9ad65d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd3f9c014d9cf8289c2f4db01bedc600c9ad65d2/0_266_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The idea of the body is central to my work\u2019 \u2026 Doshi performs Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The idea of the body is central to my work\u2019 \u2026 Doshi performs <em>Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods.</em> <strong> </strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Tishani Doshi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Male violence is just one of the threats present in <em>Small Days and Nights</em>, in which three women, finding themselves living together in coastal rural India, also have to navigate economic and environmental hostilities. Doshi herself lives, with her husband the writer Carlo Pizzati, in an isolated house in a coastal Tamil Nadu village. The area has seen illegal land grabs and environmental destruction. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a tsunami, cyclones, floods. There is erosion. It is a fragile place to live. Then there is your personal safety. I\u2019m interested in what happens in the head about those fears, because even the imagined ones become very real.\u201d</p> <p>Doshi acknowledges that she occupies a privileged place in village life. \u201cIt\u2019s the insider/outsider thing,\u201d she observes. \u201cFor instance, I can go out alone at night, without my husband, in a way that is much more difficult for local women. But that doesn\u2019t mean I am above it all or immune. The dangers don\u2019t go away.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most graphic illustration of Doshi\u2019s \u201chybridity\u201d as she calls it, is the name of her beachside house, Ar Lan y M\u00f4r, which is Welsh for \u201cbeside the sea\u201d and the title of a Welsh folk song. \u201cI have Wales and India, the city and the village, poet-novelist-dancer and so many more,\u201d she laughs. \u201cNo wonder I am so interested in what \u2018home\u2019 means.\u201d</p> <p>She was born in Madras in 1975, the middle of three children, to a Gujarati father and a mother from a small village in north Wales. The touching tale of how they ended up together in India is told in Doshi\u2019s Orange prize-longlisted 2010 debut novel <em>The Pleasure Seekers</em>. \u201cI had read some of their letters and thought it was this amazing love story,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut I also wanted to write a reverse immigration novel about a couple choosing to live in the apparently less prosperous country. I don\u2019t think they had decided they were going to have the rest of their lives there, but they are still in Madras and have now been together for more than 50 years.\u201d Doshi still prefers to use the old name for her home city. \u201cI do sometimes use Chennai, but Madras was the place I was born in and now Chennai seems a different avatar of the city; more modern and technological. Madras is more romantic for me. Just one more example of hybridity, I suppose.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Today everyone is a feminist, but that used to mean demanding structural change.

She learned the piano and did some Indian dance, but sport was more important (\u201cI was quite good at tennis and thought for a while I was going to be the next Gabriela Sabatini\u201d), as was art and literature. In 1993 she won a scholarship to study economics in the US and while there \u201cdiscovered contemporary American poetry\u201d, citing poets such as Mark Doty and Mary Oliver. \u201cThat changed everything.

She has also drawn on her own family history for <em>Small Days and Nights</em>, saying one of the sparks for the novel was reading about how in the 1960s Arthur Miller had institutionalised his son who had Down\u2019s syndrome. Doshi\u2019s younger brother, Ajay, was born with Down\u2019s syndrome in 1977.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the Millers did wasn\u2019t unusual and they probably thought they were doing the best for their child,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen Ajay was born, differently abled people were pretty much expected to be invisible. They were just kept away at home. It\u2019s still often the case. But my parents didn\u2019t do this and as a result we were always coming across this stare, a look of incomprehension from people. As a child it had a huge impact on me because you\u2019re very protective. I still can\u2019t understand why people are so threatened.\u201d She says it was always a subject she wanted to write about and had done tangentially in a few poems. \u201cBut then I thought I would like to write about sisters and the emotions of having to care for someone in this specific landscape and that gave me the tension I needed around the story.\u201d</p> <p>The three women in <em>Small Days and Nights</em> living together in a house without men allowed Doshi to explore alternative infrastructures and support networks. While she is wary about generalising about Indian life \u2013 \u201cit is too large and diverse\u201d \u2013 she acknowledges for many women, particularly in cities, there are more freedoms. \u201cSo it\u2019s a great moment in some ways with many role models of strong independent woman. But is it filtering down? It is still a very patriarchal society. There is a focus on the male child and a horrible sex ratio because of infanticide. Every time there is a violent incident people think that maybe it\u2019s better we don\u2019t allow our girls to go to work because it may not be safe. Maybe we don\u2019t send our girls to school. There are steps forward and back. Today everyone is a feminist, but that used to mean demanding structural change. We need to think about that.\u201d</p> <p>As to the future, Doshi says she is in the early stages of planning another dance piece. \u201cI briefly stopped performing two years ago after many years, but quickly realised I was not ready to give up on performance as part of my identity. I didn\u2019t want to be <em>just</em> a writer\u201d. She is also hoping to write a memoir about dance and her relationship with Chandralekha. \u201cAnd always there is the poetry. Whenever I finish one thing I will have a poem on the go to return to. Since the beginning it has been at the heart of what I do. After all these years it is still my default.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/small-days-and-nights-9781526603753.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"> Small Days and Nights</a> is published by Bloomsbury.</em></p>",

A literary scout came to visit and asked to meet her. \u201cThis was not long after The God of Small Things,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEverybody was looking for the next Arundhati Roy.\u201d The scout was pretty direct. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re a poet. But you should be writing novels.\u2019 I was actually quite offended. And dismayed that the publishing industry just wanted to re-order and replace. I had no plans then to write fiction.

And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf \u2013 the biggest mistake of my career.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>It\u2019s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake\u2019s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing \u2013 low-slung jeans nicknamed \u201cbumsters\u201d, for obvious reasons; thongs; crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, \u201cshrugs\u201d, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/aug/04/weatherwatch-hottest-day\" title=\"\">38.5C </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/aug/04/weatherwatch-hottest-day\" title=\"\">in Brogdale, Kent</a>.</p> \n<p>The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/22/worlddispatch.martinkettle\" title=\"\">George W Bush </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/22/worlddispatch.martinkettle\" title=\"\">narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election</a> after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 9/11, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.</p> \n<p>It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women\u2019s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell \u2013 himself a former Observer journalist \u2013 Ernest Hemingway, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/24/trouble-seen-martha-gellhorn-review\" title=\"\">Martha Gellhorn </a>and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the job\u2026 if you want it?\u201d Of course I did.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a73b746eebac4e2727a70a2218a24c56a431c814\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a73b746eebac4e2727a70a2218a24c56a431c814/0_80_1231_1537/801.jpg\" alt=\"Nicole Mowbray\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicole Mowbray in 2004: \u2018I felt privileged to be part of the team \u2013 but also out of my depth.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Shaw/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry \u2013 the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach &amp; Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book \u2013 a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, \u201creplacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team \u2013 but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/turkey-explosion-rocks-major-kurdish-city-of-diyarbakir\" title=\"\">Diyarbakir</a> and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn\u2019t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c251e1eb51c1f702d133accc307fe34b67dcc593\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c251e1eb51c1f702d133accc307fe34b67dcc593/79_0_7253_9060/801.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of woman typing\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wasn\u2019t given any other information.

Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn\u2019t given any other information. Their only instruction: \u201cDon\u2019t make any mistakes.\u201d And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.</p> \n<p><em>Importance HIGH</em><br><em>Top Secret</em><br><em>All</em><br><em>As you\u2019ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge\u2026</em><br><em>\u2026 We\u2019d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.</em></p> \n<p>It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper\u2019s front-page splash: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/02/usa.iraq\" title=\"\">Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war</a>\u201d. Underneath was the memo I\u2019d typed up.</p> \n<p>Of course, the story \u2013 broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) \u2013 was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn\u2019t expect it to be the office. It was \u2013 I think \u2013 Stephen Pritchard, the paper\u2019s readers\u2019 editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused \u201csomething of an international incident\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I assumed I\u2019d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I\u2019d changed all the American spelling \u201cmistakes\u201d to British English. \u201cRecognize\u201d became recognise, and \u201cemphasize\u201d emphasise. \u201cFavorable\u201d was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.</p> \n<p>The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/24/how-the-drudge-report-ushered-in-the-age-of-trump\" title=\"\">the Drudge Report</a>, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer\u2019s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo\u2019s authenticity. It was decided the readers\u2019 editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us \u201clying limey bastards\u201d, claiming that the story\u2019s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d7d6832148964bf19b85339d8e66ede24f85685\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d7d6832148964bf19b85339d8e66ede24f85685/13_9_1567_1957/801.jpg\" alt=\"The Observer\u2019s front-page splash on Sunday 2 March 2003.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Observer\u2019s front-page splash on Sunday 2 March 2003.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Of course, it was not. Despite my \u201cadministrative error\u201d, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded; she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I\u2019d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back; it had, of course, been filled.</p> \n<p>By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I\u2019d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name \u2013 one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt \u2013 they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I\u2019d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn\u2019t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.</p> \n<p>Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.</p> \n<p>When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn\u2019t divulge any specifics about the movie. \u201cBut is it made clear I wasn\u2019t fired over what happened?\u201d I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? \u201cMost of my outfits were probably too casual,\u201d I said. \u201cI was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.\u201d And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.</p> \n<p>Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as \u201cNicole\u201d got bawled out by the Observer\u2019s famously sweary then editor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/09/profile-roger-alton\" title=\"\">Roger Alton</a> (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team \u2013 thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me \u2013 albeit a more groomed version.</p> \n<p>I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn\u2019t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one\u2019s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 October</p> \n<p>If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

What did you do in that story?\u201d \u201cThat story\u201d concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan \u2013 nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq. The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations \u201cparticularly directed at\u2026 UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)\u201d to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf \u2013 the biggest mistake of my career. *** It\u2019s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake\u2019s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing \u2013 low-slung jeans nicknamed \u201cbumsters\u201d, for obvious reasons; thongs; crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, \u201cshrugs\u201d, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent. The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 9/11, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair. It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women\u2019s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell \u2013 himself a former Observer journalist \u2013 Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the job\u2026 if you want it?\u201d Of course I did. Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry \u2013 the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach &amp; Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book \u2013 a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, \u201creplacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver\u201d. It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team \u2013 but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn\u2019t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing. Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer\u2019s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor \u2013 played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn\u2019t given any other information. Their only instruction: \u201cDon\u2019t make any mistakes.\u201d And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence. Importance HIGH Top Secret All As you\u2019ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge\u2026 \u2026 We\u2019d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines. It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task. *** On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper\u2019s front-page splash: \u201cRevealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war\u201d. Underneath was the memo I\u2019d typed up. Of course, the story \u2013 broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) \u2013 was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn\u2019t expect it to be the office. It was \u2013 I think \u2013 Stephen Pritchard, the paper\u2019s readers\u2019 editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused \u201csomething of an international incident\u201d. Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I\u2019d changed all the American spelling \u201cmistakes\u201d to British English. \u201cRecognize\u201d became recognise, and \u201cemphasize\u201d emphasise. \u201cFavorable\u201d was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster. The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer\u2019s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo\u2019s authenticity. It was decided the readers\u2019 editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us \u201clying limey bastards\u201d, claiming that the story\u2019s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation. Of course, it was not. Despite my \u201cadministrative error\u201d, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded; she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence. *** Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I\u2019d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back; it had, of course, been filled. By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I\u2019d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name \u2013 one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt \u2013 they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I\u2019d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn\u2019t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation. Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years. When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn\u2019t divulge any specifics about the movie. \u201cBut is it made clear I wasn\u2019t fired over what happened?\u201d I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? \u201cMost of my outfits were probably too casual,\u201d I said. \u201cI was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.\u201d And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable. Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as \u201cNicole\u201d got bawled out by the Observer\u2019s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team \u2013 thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me \u2013 albeit a more groomed version. I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn\u2019t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one\u2019s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last. \u2022 Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 October If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "bodyText": "1 Can Bielsa get Leeds over the line? As Leeds begin a 16th successive season outside the top flight, doubts still linger despite Marcelo Bielsa signing up for round two at Elland Road. There are concerns that Leeds are light on quality and worries that their defence is too easily unlocked \u2013 but in the bucket-wielding Bielsa, the Argentinian who has reset standards and expectation, they boast a master key. \u201cWe can arrive at the goal we want to achieve,\u201d he says. 2 Will Brentford have a fairytale Griffin Park goodbye? It is a bitter blow for supporters \u2013 both home and away \u2013 who enjoy the pre-match ritual of hopping round to the four pubs dotted on each corner of the 115-year-old stadium: Brentford are saying farewell to Griffin Park in May next year and heading off to a new home on Lionel Road near Kew Bridge for 2020-21. So could the Bees go out with a bang? If anyone was unconvinced about their short-term ambition, the arrival of Pontus Jansson from Leeds for a club\u2011record \u00a35.5m is proof they mean business. 3 Can Cocu make a big impression? \u201cSweat equity\u201d was how Mel Morris, the Derby owner, described the emotional investment into his hometown club, who lost in last season\u2019s play-off final. After Stoke poached Gary Rowett and Chelsea took Frank Lampard, Phillip Cocu becomes Derby\u2019s seventh manager in four years. But if his team can exude as much class as the Dutchman then supporters could be in for a treat after countless near misses. 4 Are Bristol City dark horses for promotion? Lee Johnson said Bristol City would be bold this summer and they have delivered on his promise. Tomas Kalas has signed for a club-record \u00a38m, Jay Dasilva has also signed permanently, as have Tommy Rowe and Dan Bentley, though they still may be a striker short \u2013 they are keen on Arsenal\u2019s Eddie Nketiah. The Robins, who finished eighth last season, have improved year on year under Johnson. 5 Will Jones (mark II) make an impact at Luton? There are several new faces in the managerial landscape \u2013 from Cocu to Steve Cooper \u2013 but the arrival of Nathan Jones\u2019s permanent successor at Luton, Graeme Jones, was more low-key than most. A long-time assistant of Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Jones has swapped World Cup semi-finals for slogging it out in the second tier. Of the 18 teams that started and finished last season as a Championship club, only six have the same manager this campaign. 6 Will Reading strike the right balance? \u201cJaap Stam back at Reading\u201d was how Jon Walters put it, poking fun at the picture that accompanied news that his former Stoke teammate Charlie Adam had signed for Reading. There were some green shoots towards the end of a dismal season but Adam, the 33-year-old former Liverpool midfielder, along with Michael Morrison, the former Birmingham captain, provide experience as Jos\u00e9 Gomes seeks a better blend. 7 Can Huddersfield bounce straight back? Almost all of the noise around Huddersfield is about their kits \u2013 job done, then \u2013 but what of the players who will wear them? Jan Siewert\u2019s side fell badly short in the Premier League but they possess ample talent to push for an instant return. They have retained Aaron Mooy, Alex Pritchard and record signing Terence Kongolo, and have added quality in Tommy Elphick, who led Bournemouth to the top flight in 2015. 8 How will Wednesday be post-Bruce? His resignation went down like a lead balloon but there is no denying the job Steve Bruce did at Hillsborough. He made an ordinary squad sing and an 11-match unbeaten run almost propelled them to the play-offs. Whoever replaces him will do well to eclipse his 12th-place finish. Their summer business so far consists of three free transfers. 9 Will Forest\u2019s gamble pay off? \u201cWe have been champions \u2013 in business, with Olympiakos, both in Greece and in Europe, so why not repeat this with Nottingham Forest?\u201d says owner Evangelos Marinakis, a Greek shipping magnate. It is a roaring soundbite but the reality is Marinakis has replaced the respected Martin O\u2019Neill with Sabri Lamouchi, whose only previous managerial experience comprises three years in Qatar, two in the Ivory Coast and 13 months in charge of Rennes. Marinakis wants promotion pronto \u2013 but is Lamouchi the best man for the job? 10 Can Bowyer repeat the miracle?

The former Bournemouth defender has appointed Gary Waddock, the former Aldershot manager, as his No 2, and the former Bulgaria striker Svetoslav Todorov, who Bond worked with alongside Harry Redknapp at Portsmouth in 2002, as the first-team coach. 12 Can Forest Green make more history?

There were pros and cons. The commute was short but it was hard to keep work and family life separate \u2013 especially with Honor\u00e9, then a toddler, always keen to go downstairs and see what his mother was doing. So Hernand decided to rent an office elsewhere and reclaim the ground floor space to live in. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant now \u2013 with both floors joined together, it feels like a little house,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7482b27dd599a7134b04ef057cf8f05c7c5e45ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7482b27dd599a7134b04ef057cf8f05c7c5e45ee/0_0_3543_4724/750.jpg\" alt=\"The library wall in Camille Hernand\u2019s maisonette in the Marais district of Paris\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A library wall papered in <a href=\"https://bien-fait-paris.com/fr/papier-peint/88-boheme.html\">Boh\u00e8me</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herv\u00e9 Goluza</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She set about the renovation herself. First, she removed some walls, stripping them back to ther original exposed beams, or inserting internal windows in their place. The front door opens on to a square hall, divided from the main living space by a tangle of thick, ancient beams. To the right, modern steel-framed glazing leads into a book-lined space with a large table, where a further glass door circles back into the living area. The first floor is reached via a reclaimed metal spiral staircase; standing at the top, all three bedrooms can be seen at once, thanks to the internal windows Hernand has set into the walls. Blinds can fold down for privacy \u2013 something she thinks will become more important once her children reach their teens. It\u2019s not the case just yet.

      "bodyText": "Camille Hernand\u2019s Paris maisonette is designed with solitude in mind. The architect\u2019s three children, Madeleine, 10, Adela\u00efde, nine, and Honor\u00e9, five, divide their time between here and their father\u2019s house, on alternate weeks. Stylish steel-framed internal glazed doors and windows, and open-plan spaces where walls once divided, help her feel less enclosed and alone when her brood ups sticks. \u201cEven when my children aren\u2019t here, I have a sense of their presence and personalities,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it was a house of ordinary walls and doors, I believe it would feel different. I would feel the solitude. It\u2019s important that when they return, this place immediately feels welcoming, open and like home. But, equally, the house has to feel good for me on my \u2018off\u2019 weeks, when everything goes quiet.\u201d The ground floor of this 19th-century building on a narrow street in the Marais district \u2013 a far cry from Paris\u2019s grand Haussmann-era apartments \u2013 used to be a dairy (some original tiles remain), then functioned as various shops until, four years ago, Hernand bought it to use as her office. \u201cA year later, the flat upstairs came up for sale, so we moved in and lived \u2018above the shop\u2019 for a while,\u201d she says. There were pros and cons. The commute was short but it was hard to keep work and family life separate \u2013 especially with Honor\u00e9, then a toddler, always keen to go downstairs and see what his mother was doing. So Hernand decided to rent an office elsewhere and reclaim the ground floor space to live in. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant now \u2013 with both floors joined together, it feels like a little house,\u201d she says. She set about the renovation herself. First, she removed some walls, stripping them back to ther original exposed beams, or inserting internal windows in their place. The front door opens on to a square hall, divided from the main living space by a tangle of thick, ancient beams. To the right, modern steel-framed glazing leads into a book-lined space with a large table, where a further glass door circles back into the living area. The first floor is reached via a reclaimed metal spiral staircase; standing at the top, all three bedrooms can be seen at once, thanks to the internal windows Hernand has set into the walls. Blinds can fold down for privacy \u2013 something she thinks will become more important once her children reach their teens. It\u2019s not the case just yet. Her daughters share an L-shaped room with beds at opposite ends, but often drag their mattresses into the centre to sleep side by side. \u201cThere is only a year between them, so they are very close,\u201d she says. This internal configuration means there\u2019s a good flow of natural light, but Hernand\u2019s bigger aim was for the rooms to feel like segments of the same jigsaw rather than sealed-off spaces. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to walk in and be greeted by a series of closed doors and blank walls,\u201d she says. Each room has its own character, but feels connected. Secondhand furniture adds to the historic mood, most of it bought at Les Puces flea market over the years. Lighting is a mix of contemporary and vintage, and the apartment is filled with art and black-and-white photography, displayed on picture ledges.

      "bodyText": "Sacked defence minister Tobias Ellwood has urged Boris Johnson to \u201cstep back from the rhetoric\u201d in his dealings with Brussels to ensure the country does not crash out of the EU without a deal. The former army officer was a casualty of Johnson\u2019s ministerial cull as he took over at Downing Street this week and sought to shake up his government team. The new prime minister has repeatedly pledged to take the country out of the EU on 31 October even if he fails to agree a deal with Brussels. But Ellwood \u2013 who backed remain during the 2016 referendum \u2013 has been a firm no-deal critic, saying before his sacking that such a scenario \u201cisn\u2019t a solution\u201d. The Conservative MP, who bravely tried to save the life of PC Keith Palmer after he was stabbed during the Westminster terror attack, said he was shocked at his sacking. Giving his first interview since being axed, Ellwood told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that it was a \u201cbrutal game\u201d, adding: \u201cBut it is a recognition that that is the world we enter when we sign up to politics.\u201d Despite being shown the door by the prime minister, he called on fellow Tory MPs to back Johnson to get Brexit \u201cover the line\u201d and said he should be given a \u201cfair wind\u201d. However, asked about the strong rhetoric used by Johnson \u2013 who has said the country must \u201cturbocharge\u201d preparations for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 Ellwood replied: \u201cMy one first bit of humble advice might be, let\u2019s step back from the rhetoric that we saw on the campaign trail.

But it turns out that Diss is twice as far from the school as Norwich, to the extent that the taxi driver has no clue how to get there. I put that to Holt when I meet him and his reply is succinct. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>A certain obstinacy served Holt well in his career. The 38-year-old has published an autobiography that details his journey up and, just as often, down the league ladder. He played for 17 clubs and scored 192 goals. Some spells he relished, others he spent at loggerheads with the manager (see: Colin Calderwood, Nottingham Forest). Ultimately, however, Holt became one of the more unlikely goalscoring sensations in Premier League history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/22/sean-dyche-interview-alastair-campbell\">Sean Dyche: 'You're constantly looking for the X factor, that mystical ingredient' | Alastair Campbell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twenty-three goals in two seasons for the Canaries put Holt close to the England squad, only for Roy Hodgson to travel to Euro 2012 with four strikers instead of the customary five.

Yes</a>. Of course, you would be. Anyone who says they wouldn\u2019t is a liar. To wear the England shirt, to stand there and wear that shirt, it would be the most ridiculous thing that I\u2019d ever achieved. But, at the same time, would I have thought I\u2019d ever play in the Premier League?\u201d</p> <p>Holt\u2019s book is good on his early years. Amid lots of Swallows and Amazons details (except it\u2019s the 80s and the location is Carlisle), Holt tells how he was inspired by his competitive dad to pursue a career in the game and how a boyish enthusiasm for kicking a ball around kept him going through frequent tough times.

My talent was learning, being able to outwit someone, knowing that I could exploit your weakness with my strengths. That was it. And I ran harder than anyone else. People laugh at that. They say I wasn\u2019t as fit as other people. Maybe I wasn\u2019t, but you get to the match day and it didn\u2019t matter to me.

      "bodyText": "On the way to Norwich to interview Grant Holt, he rings me on the train. \u201cHi mate,\u201d he says in a breezy voice, \u201cyou should get off at Diss, it\u2019s quicker.\u201d The former Norwich City, Sheffield Wednesday and Sengkang Marine striker has a role coaching students at a boarding school deep in the Norfolk countryside, so I take his advice. But it turns out that Diss is twice as far from the school as Norwich, to the extent that the taxi driver has no clue how to get there. I put that to Holt when I meet him and his reply is succinct. \u201cNo, it isn\u2019t.\u201d A certain obstinacy served Holt well in his career. The 38-year-old has published an autobiography that details his journey up and, just as often, down the league ladder. He played for 17 clubs and scored 192 goals. Some spells he relished, others he spent at loggerheads with the manager (see: Colin Calderwood, Nottingham Forest). Ultimately, however, Holt became one of the more unlikely goalscoring sensations in Premier League history. Twenty-three goals in two seasons for the Canaries put Holt close to the England squad, only for Roy Hodgson to travel to Euro 2012 with four strikers instead of the customary five. Missing out on a cap is as close as it gets to a regret for Holt, a man who has found perspective thanks to his long and winding career, and who may be one of the last of his kind. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re now regretting getting off at Diss and not Norwich.

      "bodyText": "Ahir Shah The misanthrope The double Edinburgh comedy award nominee returns with Dots, a show that professes to explore everything from dead German sociologists to sadness. Having appeared on Frankie Boyle\u2019s New World Order and Have I Got News for You, his commanding presence and poise position him as the ideal candidate for panel-show prominence. Monkey Barrel Comedy, Thursday 1 to 25 August Ultimate zinger \u2018I\u2019ve stopped smoking. More accurately, people who love me kept yelling that they were worried I was going to die, so now I have to smoke a fucking USB stick\u2019 Arnab Chanda The introvert Chanda\u2019s trajectory is far from the hackneyed Footlights to Radio 4 narrative. Having lost his hair in his early 30s through alopecia, the comic went through a radical transformation. He quit his job, retreated from the world and embarked on a life-changing journey around South America (including an unsuccessful ayahuasca trip). He is now back for debut hour Boy from Earth, bringing his highly accomplished storytelling to the fringe, and managing to articulate anxiety and ease all at once \u2013 a little bit Woody Allen-ish. If that\u2019s not convincing enough, Simon Amstell calls him the \u201cfunniest person on Earth\u201d. Voodoo Rooms, 3 to 25 August Ultimate zinger \u2018I love pizza. Boy oh boy. I think my favourite thing about a pizza slice is that it points in the direction that it\u2019s supposed to go: my mouth. And it\u2019s also why rice confuses me\u2019 Catherine Cohen The avant-garde entertainer A New York millennial who is \u201ctragically unverified on Twitter\u201d, Cohen perfectly parodies the angst of the modern female twentysomething experience, swerving the usual avo-toast cliches and heading straight towards oddball musical comedy and wry valley-girl commentary of her hobbies such as \u201cdry-swallowing birth control pills\u201d. The Twist\u2026? She\u2019s Gorgeous is the comedy cabaret act\u2019s debut fringe show; she is joined by Henry Koperski on the keys. Pleasance Courtyard, Wednesday 31 July to 25 August Ultimate zinger \u2018I love sex because it famously has no consequences\u2019 Sophie Duker The truthsayer Following the success of Diet Woke, Duker returns with Venus, \u201can unconventional journey of self-discovery\u201d. The writer, host and unswervingly confident standup has also dabbled in feminist sketches (Channel 4\u2019s Riot Girls), co-hosts a millennial advice show (Radio 4\u2019s GrownUpLand), leads comedy night and \u201cirreverent cabaret comedy show\u201d Wacky Racists and was one of 50 LGBTQ figures on the cover of Attitude magazine\u2019s 25th-birthday edition. She also hates yorkshire puddings. Pleasance Courtyard, Wednesday 31 July to 25 August Ultimate zinger \u2018I\u2019m a \u201ctriple-threat\u201d minority \u2026 I make white people uncomfortable when I sing, act or dance\u2019 Jack Rooke The lovable wit He has got a large amount of hair, he\u2019s from Watford and he likes to tell jokes about having sex with your dad. In a nice way. Rooke is unlike the majority of male standups on the circuit, but his warmth and charm make him primed for future sitcom success.

It has also prompted renewed calls from at least one British charity for the sport to be permanently banned.</p> <p>While the head trauma inherent to other sports such as American football, rugby and ice hockey has come increasingly under the microscope in recent years, only in boxing are dangers such as concussions not by-products but the very objective.</p> <p>The spectre of death has loomed over the prize ring throughout history: from its recorded origins as a popular spectator sport in ancient Greece and Rome (until it was abolished by Theodoric in AD 500), during its bare-knuckle resurgence in England during the 1600s and modernization with the Marquess of Queensberry Rules in 1884 through to the present day.</p> <p>The mere threat of it frightens and titillates the spectators who are party to the contest, satisfying a latent bloodlust common with those who attend hockey games for the fights or watch Nascar for the spark-flying wrecks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Death in the ring is statistically rare but there is no question boxing is the most dangerous pastime despite a perception as the tamer alternative to the often grisly spectacle of mixed martial arts and the head-to-toe violence it purveys to a generally younger demographic.</p> <p>MMA fighters wear smaller four-ounce gloves that are less conducive to defense and more prone to causing cuts, though what many do not realize is the extra padding on boxing gloves exists not to protect the face but the fist, allowing fighters to throw punches with full force at their opponent\u2019s heads without fear of breaking the bones in their hands.</p> <p>The prolonged punishment and longer fights invite a higher rate of head trauma, unconsciousness, facial injuries and broken bones. There have been no fatalities in the history of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, despite its widespread reputation for brutality, since MMA\u2019s leading promotion was launched in 1993. Thirty boxers have died in the same span.</p> <p>Hundreds more boxers died in the years before \u2013 Ring magazine reported 22 deaths in 1953 \u2013 with many coming in high-profile world championship bouts.

      "bodyText": "There are no easy answers for the tragedies that have rocked professional boxing over the past week. The Argentinian junior welterweight Hugo Alfredo Santillan died on Thursday from injuries suffered during last Saturday\u2019s fight against Uruguay\u2019s Eduardo Javier Abreu in the Buenos Aires, becoming the second fatality in four days after Russia\u2019s Maxim Dadashev succumbed to injuries suffered last Friday in Maryland. The double horror is a chilling reminder of the danger at hand any time a fighter climbs through the ropes into the squared circle, the only venue in society, with the exception of war, where a person can be killed but not legally murdered. It has also prompted renewed calls from at least one British charity for the sport to be permanently banned. While the head trauma inherent to other sports such as American football, rugby and ice hockey has come increasingly under the microscope in recent years, only in boxing are dangers such as concussions not by-products but the very objective. The spectre of death has loomed over the prize ring throughout history: from its recorded origins as a popular spectator sport in ancient Greece and Rome (until it was abolished by Theodoric in AD 500), during its bare-knuckle resurgence in England during the 1600s and modernization with the Marquess of Queensberry Rules in 1884 through to the present day. The mere threat of it frightens and titillates the spectators who are party to the contest, satisfying a latent bloodlust common with those who attend hockey games for the fights or watch Nascar for the spark-flying wrecks. Death in the ring is statistically rare but there is no question boxing is the most dangerous pastime despite a perception as the tamer alternative to the often grisly spectacle of mixed martial arts and the head-to-toe violence it purveys to a generally younger demographic. MMA fighters wear smaller four-ounce gloves that are less conducive to defense and more prone to causing cuts, though what many do not realize is the extra padding on boxing gloves exists not to protect the face but the fist, allowing fighters to throw punches with full force at their opponent\u2019s heads without fear of breaking the bones in their hands. The prolonged punishment and longer fights invite a higher rate of head trauma, unconsciousness, facial injuries and broken bones. There have been no fatalities in the history of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, despite its widespread reputation for brutality, since MMA\u2019s leading promotion was launched in 1993. Thirty boxers have died in the same span. Hundreds more boxers died in the years before \u2013 Ring magazine reported 22 deaths in 1953 \u2013 with many coming in high-profile world championship bouts. Jimmy Doyle died of brain injuries after being knocked out by Sugar Ray Robinson in a welterweight title fight. The same with Benny Paret after a loss to Emile Griffith a decade and a half later in a fight for the 147lb title. Davey Moore died after collapsing in his dressing room following a loss to Sugar Ramos for the featherweight championship. Only after the death of the South Korean lightweight Duk-koo Kim following a 1982 fight with Ray Mancini was widespread reform sparked, including the reduction of the number of rounds in championship fights from 15 to 12. Not long after, the American Medical Association passed a resolution for the sport to be banned that, predictably, fell on deaf ears. You cannot eradicate a compulsion that is innate in us, whether middle-class moralizers want to admit it or not. To get rid of it would simply drive it underground to a place with no government oversight requiring qualified referees, ringside physicians and emergency medical staff on call. Boxing is here to stay. Putting aside the exhibitions of extreme physical and psychological intensity, the sport has long been a sport of the underclass, credited with changing the lives of the disenfranchised and impoverished. There are no barriers to entry. It is, as George Foreman says, the sport to which all other sports aspire. Rather than fruitless calls for abolition, better to honor Santillan and Dadashev by calling for reform from within. Will the promoters who profited off their blood and sweat be there to offer financial support for their families after the outrage fades? Will they pay for their medical and funeral expenses since insurance companies do not underwrite life insurance policies for fighters because of the inherent danger of their trade? Will there be counseling for those left behind: the \u201cvictorious\u201d fighters, the corner men, the family members whose lives will never be the same? Perhaps the sport\u2019s power brokers can honor them by coming together to organize a long-overdue health and pension plan for retired fighters. The life-threatening realities of this strange, primitive trade cannot be managed or contained any more than the tragedies of yesterday can be undone, but maybe those who derive their fortunes from the courage of the crazy-brave can do their part to make a better tomorrow.",

Both were held at Manchester\u2019s Central Library. The former was chaired by the Guardian\u2019s science editor, Ian Sample, and included <strong>Kate Bell</strong>, the head of economics, rights and international at the Trade Unions Congress; <strong>Noel Sharkey</strong>, emeritus professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at University of Sheffield; <strong>Olly Buston</strong>, founder of the thinktank Future Advocacy, and <strong>Professor Debra Howcroft </strong>from the University of Manchester. The latter was chaired by the Guardian\u2019s northern editor, <strong>Helen Pidd</strong> and included <strong>Professor Andy Westwood </strong>of the University of Manchester; the chief executive of the social enterprise SharpFutures, <strong>Rose Marley</strong>; <strong>Neil McInroy </strong>from the thinktank CLES; and <strong>Lisa Nandy, </strong>the MP for Wigan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a802b7d1994028f0b3d0746a2dae6674e55ade4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a802b7d1994028f0b3d0746a2dae6674e55ade4/257_113_1443_1803/800.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian supporter Dolores Long,\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian supporter Dolores Long,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dolores Long</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What appealed to you about these topics?</h2> <p>AI is such a relevant and important in any discussion about modern life, and I was keen to learn more. Peterloo was all about social unrest and the spirit of change, and so AI seems like a hugely appropriate focus for a commemorative event. That same spirit is still palpable in Manchester and across the country.</p> <p>Devolution appealed because it seems to be increasingly on the minds of the electorate as more people become engaged with politics and realise the importance of their voice. In 2018, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, spoke about his feeling that devolution had invigorated our democracy and led to a more representative and represented Manchester, helped tackle homelessness and improve transport in the city, and created a sense of a more local politics.</p> <h2>What were the highlights?</h2> <p>At the AI event, we discussed how society would counterbalance the loss of jobs that will come from increased automation. We discussed how unions would adjust to the changes and the possible benefits to workers, including freeing some from unpleasant, hard or physical labour.

      "bodyText": "Dolores Long is 75 and from Manchester. Which events did you attend? I attended a discussion on artificial intelligence and the fourth industrial revolution, and a debate on whether devolution could provide a route to a healthier democracy. Both were held at Manchester\u2019s Central Library. The former was chaired by the Guardian\u2019s science editor, Ian Sample, and included Kate Bell, the head of economics, rights and international at the Trade Unions Congress; Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at University of Sheffield; Olly Buston, founder of the thinktank Future Advocacy, and Professor Debra Howcroft from the University of Manchester. The latter was chaired by the Guardian\u2019s northern editor, Helen Pidd and included Professor Andy Westwood of the University of Manchester; the chief executive of the social enterprise SharpFutures, Rose Marley; Neil McInroy from the thinktank CLES; and Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan. What appealed to you about these topics? AI is such a relevant and important in any discussion about modern life, and I was keen to learn more. Peterloo was all about social unrest and the spirit of change, and so AI seems like a hugely appropriate focus for a commemorative event. That same spirit is still palpable in Manchester and across the country. Devolution appealed because it seems to be increasingly on the minds of the electorate as more people become engaged with politics and realise the importance of their voice. In 2018, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, spoke about his feeling that devolution had invigorated our democracy and led to a more representative and represented Manchester, helped tackle homelessness and improve transport in the city, and created a sense of a more local politics. What were the highlights? At the AI event, we discussed how society would counterbalance the loss of jobs that will come from increased automation. We discussed how unions would adjust to the changes and the possible benefits to workers, including freeing some from unpleasant, hard or physical labour. We also explored how workers would be safeguarded against the threat of AI, or whether the changes are an inevitability that we must prepare for. For many industries, the future is already here \u2013 just look at the increased use of drones and driverless cars, not to mention the use of machines in hospitals. As with devolution, it feels imperative that we have these conversations as soon as possible \u2013 and not just at a government level. What were your big takeaways from the events? These were both huge topics to tackle in just a couple of hours, but I was really struck by how engaged people were, and how keen they were to think through the complexities of both areas. The events were really well attended, and not just by Mancunians \u2013 many in the audience had travelled some distance to be there.

      "body": "<p>Despite our best intentions to equally parent our firstborn child, my husband and I slipped into the traditional roles of him returning to work while I took on the childcare. We were both self-employed, and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave/eligibility\" title=\"\">freelance fathers aren\u2019t entitled to paternity pay</a>, so Rich took less than two weeks off before returning full-time to his job. It was the same when our son was born two years later, except that by that point I\u2019d built a freelance career from home, so I was then looking after a two-year-old, a newborn and a business.</p> <p>We are weeks away from the birth of our third baby and this time we have decided to do things differently. Earlier this year I had a book published, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/freelance-mum.html\" title=\"\">The Freelance Mum</a>. Off the back of it, I was able to launch an online course advising small businesses and freelancers on doing their own PR. There was clearly an appetite for this course, and I launched another on becoming your own boss.</p> <p>Having proved that this online course business was not just viable, but also lucrative \u2013 bringing in \u00a37,000 a month, with no overheads \u2013 we decided it made sense for Rich to quit his job. His knees were suffering from years of building work and he wanted to spend more time with our children. Also, he made documentary films and wondered if he could find time for that if we adjusted our work-life situation. He is now supporting me with the marketing side of my business, and there is less pressure on us, with everything split more or less equally at home.</p> <p>Research suggests businesses run by mothers contribute upwards of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/11782294/Mumpreneurs-generate-7bn-for-the-UK-economy.html\" title=\"\">\u00a37bn to the UK economy</a> each year.

      "bodyText": "Despite our best intentions to equally parent our firstborn child, my husband and I slipped into the traditional roles of him returning to work while I took on the childcare. We were both self-employed, and freelance fathers aren\u2019t entitled to paternity pay, so Rich took less than two weeks off before returning full-time to his job. It was the same when our son was born two years later, except that by that point I\u2019d built a freelance career from home, so I was then looking after a two-year-old, a newborn and a business. We are weeks away from the birth of our third baby and this time we have decided to do things differently. Earlier this year I had a book published, The Freelance Mum. Off the back of it, I was able to launch an online course advising small businesses and freelancers on doing their own PR. There was clearly an appetite for this course, and I launched another on becoming your own boss. Having proved that this online course business was not just viable, but also lucrative \u2013 bringing in \u00a37,000 a month, with no overheads \u2013 we decided it made sense for Rich to quit his job. His knees were suffering from years of building work and he wanted to spend more time with our children. Also, he made documentary films and wondered if he could find time for that if we adjusted our work-life situation. He is now supporting me with the marketing side of my business, and there is less pressure on us, with everything split more or less equally at home. Research suggests businesses run by mothers contribute upwards of \u00a37bn to the UK economy each year. But the gender pay gap is one reason why fathers stepping back from their careers to prioritise their partner\u2019s isn\u2019t that common. With men earning more on average, it often makes financial sense for women to take on the childcare.

      "bodyText": "A couple of years ago, solely in response to reader demand, I began to research aluminium-free deodorants. Three sticky weeks and umpteen deodorants later, I could find only two I liked and each cost far more than most of us would ever shell out. Without a bargain option I could honestly recommend, I moved on. But in 2019, I\u2019ve gone aluminium-free. Why? I\u2019m by nature a sceptic and have a particularly low tolerance for the unqualified quacks of the wellness movement. I know the vast majority of their scare stories about cosmetics ingredients to be unproven and irresponsible. Much of the cobblers spoken about \u201cnatural\u201d deodorants is absurd. \u201cTransition periods\u201d where one\u2019s body releases excess toxins after decades of antiperspirant? Give me a break. Antiperspirants use aluminium to block sweat ducts, thus blocking sweat. Studies show that aluminium penetrates the skin. It\u2019s also a fact that the majority of breast cancers start in the region where antiperspirant is applied, which has sparked concern; it\u2019s also true that there\u2019s simply more tissue there. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that no causal link has been proven, and scientists and regulators have consistently found aluminium to be safe, and studies suggesting otherwise to be flawed. But why, when I don\u2019t sweat excessively (if you do, you\u2019ll want antiperspirant), do I have an instinctive aversion to my secretions being \u201cblocked\u201d?

      "bodyText": "As cinema rereleases go, next week\u2019s 30th-anniversary revival of Do the Right Thing is a well-timed one. The tangible, asphalt-melting heat of Spike Lee\u2019s high summer race-war eruption plays all the more vividly as we head stickily into August. The film is viewable online, though the chance to see just how fiercely it still plays in a cinema shouldn\u2019t be passed up. Still, in what has been a good year for Spike Lee \u2013 who finally won his long-awaited competitive Oscar for BlacKkKlansman in February \u2013 this anniversary should prompt your own streaming retrospective of the 62-year-old film-maker\u2019s varied, restless career, which jaggedly runs the gamut from sleek studio entertainments to shot-on-a-shoestring curios to hefty, authoritative documentaries. Much of it is available in the streaming realm, though the blind spots are sometimes inexplicable: you\u2019ll have to turn to DVD for Jungle Fever, his smart, spiky interracial romance, or 4 Little Girls, his piercing, Oscar-nominated doc on the 16th Street Baptist church bombing. Lee\u2019s nonfiction work is in particularly short supply, in fact. His seminal, seething post-Katrina doc When the Levees Broke can only be streamed in smudgy form on YouTube. His short films are harder still to track down, though the reliable Short of the Week site has his 16-minute doc Mo\u2019Ne Davis: Throw Like a Girl free to stream. It\u2019s a lovely miniature, capturing its subject \u2013 a 13-year-old African American girl who happens to be a prodigious Little League baseballer \u2013 with unsentimental affection. Netflix has She\u2019s Gotta Have It served two ways. Lee\u2019s 1986 debut feature, about a young black Brooklyn woman juggling three potential lovers, remains charmingly loose and jazzy. Whatever dated 80s trappings it has are counterbalanced by its fresh, forward-thinking sex positivity.

Chili also have his graceful, elegiac 25th Hour, still one of the few immediate post-9/11 dramas that doesn\u2019t look misjudged today, and three less celebrated Lee joints from the 1990s that all merit a second (or belated first) glance. The hard-boiled, blood-stained Clockers and the earthy, semi-autobiographical Crooklyn, made back to back, work as complementary urban studies of the Brooklyn-reared director\u2019s home turf. His toxic jazzman portrait Mo\u2019 Better Blues, too, holds up more colourfully than reviews at the time predicted. In addition to Chi-Raq, Lee\u2019s vibrant, jangly street spin on Aristophanes\u2019 Lysistrata, Amazon Prime has a buried treasure in Pass Over. This adaptation of Antoinette Nwandu\u2019s play was entirely overshadowed last year by BlacKkKlansman (streaming on Now TV), but this Beckett-inspired study of two homeless Chicago men getting through the day is the more affecting, poetic work.

Happy As Lazzaro (Modern Films, 12) Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s dizzy, ingenious modern take on a holy-fool fable blends magical realism and social realism to audacious, sometimes shiver-inducingly beautiful effect. Capernaum (Spirit, 15) Nadine Labaki won a lot of hearts and prizes for this heart-on-sleeve study of a scrappy 12-year-old boy surviving the streets of Beirut, and it\u2019s certainly stirring \u2013 though a bit transparently schematic too.

      "body": "<p>As I planned my summer in Wales, my head filled with visions of romance, I supposed I\u2019d do what the heroines of novels did when they crossed the pond for a new life: go to the shore to take the healing air. Meet a man and move into his stunning manor, possibly watched over by a sinister housemaid. Scurry through cobblestoned streets and into dusty bookshops, furtively pulling up the hood of my cloak. Go to a banquet and dance to piano music in a great hall. Taste gamey meats on a date with a count, then become a countess. Shoot a bow and arrow. Develop a slight accent.

There was even a little <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/30/24-hour-party-people-british\" title=\"\">24 Hour Party People</a> in there. But as it would happen, my days were long, and much more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/apr/01/favourite-tv-show-the-office-ricky-gervais-david-brent\" title=\"\">Wernham Hogg</a> than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/16/emily-bronte-wuthering-heights-100-best\" title=\"\">Wuthering Heights</a>.

I discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\" title=\"\">Love Island</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The real drama is in what they don\u2019t say as they wash their bronzer off for bed and change into their night-time thongs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Love Island, the cultural touchstone that takes over summers in the United Kingdom. I had previously only heard of this hot-weather reality soap opera from my shameful Mail Online habit (the best place to see what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/victoria-beckham\" title=\"\">Victoria Beckham</a> is wearing as she ignores the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/spicegirls\" title=\"\">Spice Girls</a>\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/26/lesbianism-gets-peoples-attention-but-i-wish-mel-b-had-kept-shtum\" title=\"\">sapphic drama</a>) but I was totally unprepared for how wholly it would take over my life and days. It seemed like a small investment, a calming way to power down as I ate my spaghetti; but as I was introduced to the villa and its anarchic customs, my vague interest turned to something like obsession. If my colleague and roommate Liz tried to turn down the volume to take a call, I turned savage: \u201cWhat the <em>hell</em> are you doing?\u201d I was busy listening to every murmur, the particularities of these regional accents, the smack of lips under duvet covers. The pop music may blare, but this is nothing if not a show of quiet human moments, where the real drama is in what they don\u2019t say as they wash their bronzer off for bed and change into their night-time thongs.</p> <p>OK, let\u2019s backtrack a second: if you\u2019re just home from a cruise to Antarctica, then let me explain Love Island. At the start of June, five men and five women were thrown into a villa in Majorca, where the expectation is that they will split into couples and start on the rocky footpath toward love. At first the couplings are loose concepts, as the duos are free to get to know who they want to, though they\u2019ll share beds and compete in confounding and semi-sexual challenges with their partners, gaining immunity from being removed when they win. But as things heat up, they participate in a dark ritual known as a \u201crecoupling\u201d, where the duos can rearrange as their eyes start to wander (and wander and wander). Sometimes the nation votes, other times it\u2019s their fellow islanders \u2013 and couples (or singles: the rules change at the whim of the invisible producers) are removed, briefly mourned, then struck from the emotional record as newer, hotter contestants are dropped into the mix. The goal is true love and a prize of \u00a350,000, which is occasionally mentioned, usually in the context of calling a woman a gold digger.</p> <p>A word about the contestants: they\u2019re young. Like, really, really young. Current national favourites Tommy and Molly-Mae, whose love story is an unusual example of penguin-like devotion, are both 20. And they\u2019re hot. Like, really, really hot. Every pale British body is tanned to the same toasted shade, so that the ridges, dimples and moles on their body disappear, and they begin to resemble human-shaped cookies. The Love Island producers are brilliantly evil and have figured out how to make the whole thing shoppable, so that the enforced neon swimwear on their still-growing bodies can be found on a website with the sinister name <a href=\"https://www.isawitfirst.com/collections/love-island-style?page=1\" title=\"\">I Saw It First</a>. The cheesy looks and regional accents of the contestants are often mocked by <a href=\"https://iaindoesjokes.com/\" title=\"\">the comedian who narrates</a> the hour, despite the fact that he has his own regional accent and appears to be wearing a Hawaiian shirt and 70s porn star glasses whenever we catch a glimpse of him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50863abc688caaa9fc8ba9bdc38e3abc580d2673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50863abc688caaa9fc8ba9bdc38e3abc580d2673/0_0_3178_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Love Islanders (from left): Maura, Amber, Anna, Tommy and Molly-Mae and Francesca.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Love Islanders (from left): Maura, Amber, Anna, Tommy and Molly-Mae, and Francesca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this is all the superficial stuff, because the deeper we go, the more we start to see ourselves. We may not be an air hostess from Worthing, West Sussex, but who among us hasn\u2019t felt like <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/amy-hart\" title=\"\">Amy</a>, the islander whose romance with ballroom dancer <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/curtis-pritchard\" title=\"\">Curtis</a> ended in betrayal upon her return from <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-07-18/love-island-casa-amor-location-return-2019/\" title=\"\">Casa Amor</a>. (I actually don\u2019t have time here to explain Casa Amor, just like I didn\u2019t have time to explain it to my mother who talked over this entire fucking episode.)</p> <p>Throughout their three-week run as \u201chalf boyfriend and girlfriend\u201d, Amy vacillated between wild euphoria and rabid jealousy, convinced that everyone was trying to steal either her man or her thunder. I found her particularly relatable because as her hold on Curtis loosened, she seemed to lose her ability to do her \u201cglam\u201d twice a day, instead skulking around in a bathing suit with a baggy bottom, her bangs frizzy, her mouth forming a pained rictus around the nozzle of her monogrammed water bottle. When Curtis made his feelings for Vogue Italia <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/jourdan-riane\" title=\"\">model Jourdan</a> known, the glint of her belly chain too shiny for him to ignore, Amy \u201cpulled him aside for a chat\u201d, then another. She bargained, she chastised and eventually she begged, looking for a way to forget his betrayal and get another hit of that salsa-dancing fantasy she thought would define the rest of her days. When he finally forced her to admit what he couldn\u2019t (that he just. Wasn\u2019t. That. Into. Her), her grief became unbearable. Eventually she decided to leave the villa so he could pursue his romance with Irish sparkplug <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/maura-higgins\" title=\"\">Maura</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I endured a public breakup that made me feel like Amber after Michael walked back into the villa with Joanna</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Maura. What can I say about Maura. She\u2019s fun. She\u2019s feisty. She\u2019s so Irish that the word \u201cmouth\u201d becomes a clipped battle cry: \u201c<em>Mout! He kissed me right on da mout!</em>\u201d But as fun as Maura is when she\u2019s fun, she can also be duplicitous and rageful. She went from telling Amy, \u201cHe tusn\u2019t love ya! He tusn\u2019t!\u201d to noticing Curtis\u2019 \u201cmanliness\u201d with the cheeky grin of a child who has peeked under the Christmas wrapping. We\u2019ve all had that friend, the one who is so all-encompassing when their lovelight is on you that you can\u2019t help but feel you\u2019ve been divinely selected. She could get you to trespass on private property, or fat shame someone despite your better judgment. Usually it\u2019s a college thing, but what is Love Island if not college minus the academics and with the emotional temperature turned all the way up?</p> <p>The look on Amy\u2019s face when she realised that Maura was going to get what she wanted and nobody \u2013 not Amy, not her new best friends for life Molly-Mae or <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/anna-vakili\" title=\"\">Anna</a> or <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/belle-hassan\" title=\"\">Belle</a> \u2013 was going to stop her, was as tender as anything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cate-blanchett\" title=\"\">Cate Blanchett</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\" title=\"\">Meryl Streep</a> has ever summoned. When Amy told the ladies that she <em>had</em> in fact found true love on the island, and it was her girls, it was the kind of moment we know all too well, where we say what we wish were true instead of what we know in our deepest of hearts actually is. She was just chattel to them, a casualty of a game that wasn\u2019t feeling that fun any more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c167c6fde765fdd96c19d1f0e669534bc6c56f97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c167c6fde765fdd96c19d1f0e669534bc6c56f97/0_1813_6382_5796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lena Dunham wearing brown dress and heart-shaped sunglasses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"908\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The deeper we go, the more we start to see ourselves.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then she was gone, and<strong> </strong>the stripped-back club classics<strong> </strong>played on. And Curtis played Maura against a fun, gap-toothed girl named <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/francesca-allen\" title=\"\">Francesca</a> who is rumoured to have once called Love Island host <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/love-island/9488037/love-island-francesca-caroline-flack-paedo/\" title=\"\">Caroline Flack a \u201cdirty paedo\u201d</a> for dating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles\" title=\"\">Harry Styles</a> when he was 17 and she was 31 (if I didn\u2019t retain all this information, could I learn another language?). When Curtis finally chose Maura, he used the half-assed professions that the island girls accept as love: \u201cI do like ya. I do want to get to know ya. You have an interesting side to ya.\u201d I, too,<strong> </strong>have sat with a smile baked on to my face as I got a watered-down version of affection. I\u2019ve heard what I wanted to hear before, and I hope I never do it again.</p> <p>This brings me to the men, whose worked-out bodies and adolescent senses of humour made my father (whose visit I used as a chance to introduce him to \u201csomething that means a lot to me\u201d) make a face as if I\u2019d brought a 77-year-old arms dealer home for Christmas. \u201cThese all seem like pretty awful people, doll,\u201d he said, before returning to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnlecarre\" title=\"\">John le Carr\u00e9</a> novel. But he didn\u2019t see what I saw. He didn\u2019t get to watch them with the night-vision camera on, snuggling up to their partners like lonely orphans tentatively seeking safety. They may mug and pose, calling girls \u201cfit\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d, but at the end of the day they are romantics, here to find a love so great it wins the nation\u2019s heart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Belle wanted love, real love, honest love. She cried tears down her contouring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Take the case of <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/anton-danyluk\" title=\"\">Anton Danyluk</a>, a Scottish gym owner whose first month saw him repeatedly rejected, trying to sleep while his roommates dry-humped feet away from him. He was everyone\u2019s friend and, because an Adonis body in the villa is so common as to become cheap, he became a symbol of pathetic singledom, a millennial male Cathy cartoon. (Does that reference fly in the UK? <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-demise-of-cathy\" title=\"\">The cartoon character</a> who loved chocolate and was always on a diet and couldn\u2019t keep a man and popularised the word <em>Ack!</em>?)</p> <p>Then came Belle, a 21-year-old makeup artist who immediately announced that she knows she has amazing boobs. On the first night she and Anton shared a bed, she ran her acrylic nails down his stomach and it appeared that he prematurely ejaculated, which she found adorable. They entered into domestic bliss and a shocking image was broadcast: Belle shaving her new boyfriend\u2019s ass, something he had previously admitted his mother did for him (let\u2019s not start a conversation we can\u2019t finish). Within days, they were drunkenly fighting: he\u2019d given his number to a shopkeeper. She\u2019d mugged him off when she refused a fake wedding ring after he kissed Anna. He was immune to her pain as she screamed, \u201cI am who I am and I\u2019ll stand by that!\u201d In the end, the dumping of two other islanders brought them back together.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to be her own best advocate,\u201d my father said. But he was wrong. She didn\u2019t stand idly by as he snogged her friend. She didn\u2019t accept it, just to stay in the faux-warmth of an unhappy union. She wanted love, real love, honest love. She cried tears down her contouring. She wanted more, and when she yelled, \u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re wrong but you!\u201d, she got it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4179a1d29d84cc2f19a83f3392c9bac89c6fb049\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4179a1d29d84cc2f19a83f3392c9bac89c6fb049/0_1025_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lena Dunham photographed in Wales, July 2019, in a biki and dress, lying on a pineapple lilo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Love Island is a fantasy world in which women are never too tired and men can never be truly cruel or abusive.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Up until now, I\u2019ve been fairly silent about why I love Love Island. To fully get why I was primed for it, you have to understand the time I\u2019ve had. Nineteen months ago, I left my first long-term relationship and endured <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lena-dunham-jack-antonoff-breakup-details-1111176\" title=\"\">a public breakup</a> that wasn\u2019t as bad as Amy\u2019s but made me feel like <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/amber-gill\" title=\"\">Amber</a> after <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/michael-griffiths\" title=\"\">Michael</a> walked back into the villa with <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/joanna-chimonides\" title=\"\">Joanna</a>. I pulled a <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/lucie-donlan\" title=\"\">Lucie</a> and immediately hurled myself at someone new, an explosive and uncomfortable five months, during which I was briefly engaged after being proposed to with the lace of a Timberland boot while snowed into my parents\u2019 apartment. I quickly realised I wasn\u2019t safe with this person and moved on to someone lovely, someone who took good care of me as I licked my wounds, and I hope I took good care of him. We spent the summer in Los Angeles. We went to the beach. We raised a kitten. We ate brunch and drove to the <a href=\"http://www.griffithobservatory.org/\" title=\"\">Griffith Observatory</a>, but the gates were already closed so we made out in the car instead.</p> <p>Everything seemed perfect except the gnawing feeling that I had no idea who I was or what I was doing. I got sick, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/15/lena-dunham-hysterectomy-anniversary-nude-photos\" title=\"\">had surgery</a> and woke up in intensive care, and realised I couldn\u2019t keep swinging from branch to branch. I\u2019d have to touch the ground. It was the nicest breakup I\u2019ve ever had. He called me \u201cdude\u201d and I knew we would stay friends, but I had to be alone for a while. A while turned out to be a few weeks, before I spent a few nights at a philosopher\u2019s house. But when he started a sentence with, \u201cYou know what women really don\u2019t understand?\u201d I was back out on the sidewalk, pinching myself. I spent a month in bed with my pets, reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\" title=\"\">Sylvia Plath</a>. I went on one blind date with a scientist I didn\u2019t know lived with a girlfriend until she posted hostile watercolours of me on the internet. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t keep living this way.\u201d This time, I meant it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"55db37516cb7619f0dac59eb8e314eeaa3aaa5c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55db37516cb7619f0dac59eb8e314eeaa3aaa5c3/924_0_2192_2121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Love Islanders Michael and Amber\" width=\"1000\" height=\"968\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael and Amber.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/ex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I came to Wales with all my art supplies and no lacy underwear. I had zero fantasies about summer romance. I hadn\u2019t had sex in seven months so I felt fine about eating all the Welsh cakes. (Have you tried them? It\u2019s like a pancake fucked a scone.) Out my window I can see sheep and cows, and if they\u2019re lying down I know my joints will ache that day, too \u2013 osteoarthritis is something they never talk about on Love Island.</p> <p>The<strong> </strong>nearby town is perfect. A pastiche of everything that appeals to me: pastel exteriors, canals bobbing with lily pads, a tiny, dusty art supply store called the Play Place, cobblestoned streets. The people who own our house are away with their grandkids for the summer and I am padding around in only my ex-boyfriend\u2019s T-shirt, though I cannot for the life of me remember which ex-boyfriend. This home is so familiar to me, as if I lived here in a past life \u2013 every carefully collected object, Regency and faux-Oriental, the seashells and tapestries, and a lot of art that says the names of the couple, engraved with hearts. They must be in love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db04daa9d4b33d524af7a37920e2bf569df37afb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db04daa9d4b33d524af7a37920e2bf569df37afb/829_0_2189_2121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Love Islanders Curtis and Maura\" width=\"1000\" height=\"969\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis and Maura.

This morning I wandered, bowl of pasta in hand, out to the back garden. I congratulated myself \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe I was outside, alone, by choice \u2013 and I was also full of wild fear. The moon was as big as I\u2019ve ever seen it and the sheep were asleep, presumably warm enough in their sheep outfits. I took a massive bite and when I looked up, the moon was gone. It was a moment that made the conflict so clear: do you consume or do you observe, do you feed yourself or do you make yourself present for life, can you do both?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When someone cracks on with your former friend, you\u2019re still there. You\u2019re watching, either in the villa or back at home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am asking myself the same questions they ask themselves on Love Island, really. Can you love again after hurt? What does partnership mean? And what does it mean to know someone if you don\u2019t know yourself?</p> <p>But on Love Island the pain is mediated. Not by their beauty, not by their youth, but by the fact that they\u2019re living in a simulacrum, constantly observed though rarely acknowledging the observer. Many sensitive souls have a tendency to narrate their own life as if it were a movie, but few of us have our first love punctuated by theme music and a guy in a sound booth somewhere. Despite never being seen, the producers are always present: when the islanders have sex under the covers like some remote religious sect, they are really trying to avoid being seen and shaming their families. When they refrain from getting sloshed and screaming their pain to the night sky, it\u2019s because the alcohol is limited by network restrictions. And when one of their phones dings and they cry out, \u201cI got a teeext!\u201d, it\u2019s the hand of God determining what the next painful choice will be.</p> <p>Love Island is a fantasy world. In there, love is sped up and clarified. Proximity creates a propulsive romance without the aching stops and starts of traditional courtship. In this heteronormative fairytale, women are never too tired and men can never be truly cruel or abusive (though this season Michael has sure tried). Nobody can ghost you because they can\u2019t go anywhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e84ab4319608b76ad72bc3b45fb0d8229139766\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e84ab4319608b76ad72bc3b45fb0d8229139766/2736_519_5520_5245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lena Dunham in red dress, leaning against red cushions, drinking green liquid out of a water bottle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"950\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I hope I meet someone who is OK with an infertile, chubby, controlling fantasist who has made a lot of mistakes but can\u2019t stop trying.\u2019 Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Harry Borden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Love Island, when someone cracks on with your former friend, you\u2019re still there. You\u2019re watching, either in the villa or back at home, having gained a million Instagram followers and a contract to promote swimwear, and so you never have to wonder where your ex is or what they are doing. Nobody is scrolling each other\u2019s Instagrams tearfully, because they\u2019re still in the neighbouring bed. I was haunted by my ex\u2019s new girlfriend wishing her favourite person a happy birthday, just as I once did, in a shirt my mother wore when she was pregnant with me and a hat I got him on a work trip to Florida. The islanders are haunted by swimming in the same pool. In that sense, they still belong to each other. Loss isn\u2019t real.</p> <p>What was amazing about what Amy did, by leaving, is that she broke the fourth wall. She acknowledged she had real feelings and that her heart was really broken, too. Like a child who has just been hit by the ball, she said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t fun any more.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to play the game.</p> <p>I hope that history properly commends her. I hope that Belle moves with Anton to Glasgow and they open a waxing salon. I hope Tommy and Molly-Mae have loads of children and teach them to love with the same ferocity that they do. I hope Amber knows her worth and Maura realises that when Curtis smiles, he looks like a Disney villain (Big Curtis Energy is when a man is so pleased with himself that he breaks into disco moves; it\u2019s a national crisis). I hope that Anna never throws Jordan over for someone taller again, and that we all learn a lesson from the egoless way that Jordan took her back, and the elegant way that <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/loveisland/ovie-soko\" title=\"\">Ovie</a> conceded.</p> <p>I hope I meet someone who is OK with an infertile, chubby, controlling fantasist who has made a lot of mistakes but can\u2019t stop trying. I hope I can show my children what it means to love with intention, without losing oneself. I hope the villa is always full of smiling faces, hopeful hearts, tearful losses and ecstatic gains. I hope we can keep cracking on, into the future for ever. I hope that summer never ends.</p> <p>\u2022 Love Island concludes on ITV2 next week.</p> <p>Styling: Hope Lawrie.

      "bodyText": "As I planned my summer in Wales, my head filled with visions of romance, I supposed I\u2019d do what the heroines of novels did when they crossed the pond for a new life: go to the shore to take the healing air. Meet a man and move into his stunning manor, possibly watched over by a sinister housemaid. Scurry through cobblestoned streets and into dusty bookshops, furtively pulling up the hood of my cloak. Go to a banquet and dance to piano music in a great hall. Taste gamey meats on a date with a count, then become a countess. Shoot a bow and arrow. Develop a slight accent. Images of everything from Brighton Rock to Emma, The Woman In White to Notting Hill, filled my head. There was even a little 24 Hour Party People in there. But as it would happen, my days were long, and much more Wernham Hogg than Wuthering Heights. And my nights were short because soon I was smacked with a 9pm curfew. No, I haven\u2019t been convicted of a crime and placed under house arrest. I discovered Love Island. Love Island, the cultural touchstone that takes over summers in the United Kingdom. I had previously only heard of this hot-weather reality soap opera from my shameful Mail Online habit (the best place to see what Victoria Beckham is wearing as she ignores the Spice Girls\u2019 sapphic drama) but I was totally unprepared for how wholly it would take over my life and days. It seemed like a small investment, a calming way to power down as I ate my spaghetti; but as I was introduced to the villa and its anarchic customs, my vague interest turned to something like obsession. If my colleague and roommate Liz tried to turn down the volume to take a call, I turned savage: \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d I was busy listening to every murmur, the particularities of these regional accents, the smack of lips under duvet covers. The pop music may blare, but this is nothing if not a show of quiet human moments, where the real drama is in what they don\u2019t say as they wash their bronzer off for bed and change into their night-time thongs. OK, let\u2019s backtrack a second: if you\u2019re just home from a cruise to Antarctica, then let me explain Love Island. At the start of June, five men and five women were thrown into a villa in Majorca, where the expectation is that they will split into couples and start on the rocky footpath toward love. At first the couplings are loose concepts, as the duos are free to get to know who they want to, though they\u2019ll share beds and compete in confounding and semi-sexual challenges with their partners, gaining immunity from being removed when they win. But as things heat up, they participate in a dark ritual known as a \u201crecoupling\u201d, where the duos can rearrange as their eyes start to wander (and wander and wander). Sometimes the nation votes, other times it\u2019s their fellow islanders \u2013 and couples (or singles: the rules change at the whim of the invisible producers) are removed, briefly mourned, then struck from the emotional record as newer, hotter contestants are dropped into the mix. The goal is true love and a prize of \u00a350,000, which is occasionally mentioned, usually in the context of calling a woman a gold digger. A word about the contestants: they\u2019re young. Like, really, really young. Current national favourites Tommy and Molly-Mae, whose love story is an unusual example of penguin-like devotion, are both 20. And they\u2019re hot. Like, really, really hot. Every pale British body is tanned to the same toasted shade, so that the ridges, dimples and moles on their body disappear, and they begin to resemble human-shaped cookies. The Love Island producers are brilliantly evil and have figured out how to make the whole thing shoppable, so that the enforced neon swimwear on their still-growing bodies can be found on a website with the sinister name I Saw It First. The cheesy looks and regional accents of the contestants are often mocked by the comedian who narrates the hour, despite the fact that he has his own regional accent and appears to be wearing a Hawaiian shirt and 70s porn star glasses whenever we catch a glimpse of him. But this is all the superficial stuff, because the deeper we go, the more we start to see ourselves. We may not be an air hostess from Worthing, West Sussex, but who among us hasn\u2019t felt like Amy, the islander whose romance with ballroom dancer Curtis ended in betrayal upon her return from Casa Amor. (I actually don\u2019t have time here to explain Casa Amor, just like I didn\u2019t have time to explain it to my mother who talked over this entire fucking episode.) Throughout their three-week run as \u201chalf boyfriend and girlfriend\u201d, Amy vacillated between wild euphoria and rabid jealousy, convinced that everyone was trying to steal either her man or her thunder. I found her particularly relatable because as her hold on Curtis loosened, she seemed to lose her ability to do her \u201cglam\u201d twice a day, instead skulking around in a bathing suit with a baggy bottom, her bangs frizzy, her mouth forming a pained rictus around the nozzle of her monogrammed water bottle. When Curtis made his feelings for Vogue Italia model Jourdan known, the glint of her belly chain too shiny for him to ignore, Amy \u201cpulled him aside for a chat\u201d, then another. She bargained, she chastised and eventually she begged, looking for a way to forget his betrayal and get another hit of that salsa-dancing fantasy she thought would define the rest of her days. When he finally forced her to admit what he couldn\u2019t (that he just. Wasn\u2019t. That. Into. Her), her grief became unbearable. Eventually she decided to leave the villa so he could pursue his romance with Irish sparkplug Maura. Maura. What can I say about Maura. She\u2019s fun. She\u2019s feisty. She\u2019s so Irish that the word \u201cmouth\u201d becomes a clipped battle cry: \u201cMout! He kissed me right on da mout!\u201d But as fun as Maura is when she\u2019s fun, she can also be duplicitous and rageful. She went from telling Amy, \u201cHe tusn\u2019t love ya! He tusn\u2019t!\u201d to noticing Curtis\u2019 \u201cmanliness\u201d with the cheeky grin of a child who has peeked under the Christmas wrapping. We\u2019ve all had that friend, the one who is so all-encompassing when their lovelight is on you that you can\u2019t help but feel you\u2019ve been divinely selected. She could get you to trespass on private property, or fat shame someone despite your better judgment. Usually it\u2019s a college thing, but what is Love Island if not college minus the academics and with the emotional temperature turned all the way up? The look on Amy\u2019s face when she realised that Maura was going to get what she wanted and nobody \u2013 not Amy, not her new best friends for life Molly-Mae or Anna or Belle \u2013 was going to stop her, was as tender as anything Cate Blanchett or Meryl Streep has ever summoned. When Amy told the ladies that she had in fact found true love on the island, and it was her girls, it was the kind of moment we know all too well, where we say what we wish were true instead of what we know in our deepest of hearts actually is. She was just chattel to them, a casualty of a game that wasn\u2019t feeling that fun any more. And then she was gone, and the stripped-back club classics played on. And Curtis played Maura against a fun, gap-toothed girl named Francesca who is rumoured to have once called Love Island host Caroline Flack a \u201cdirty paedo\u201d for dating Harry Styles when he was 17 and she was 31 (if I didn\u2019t retain all this information, could I learn another language?). When Curtis finally chose Maura, he used the half-assed professions that the island girls accept as love: \u201cI do like ya. I do want to get to know ya. You have an interesting side to ya.\u201d I, too, have sat with a smile baked on to my face as I got a watered-down version of affection. I\u2019ve heard what I wanted to hear before, and I hope I never do it again. This brings me to the men, whose worked-out bodies and adolescent senses of humour made my father (whose visit I used as a chance to introduce him to \u201csomething that means a lot to me\u201d) make a face as if I\u2019d brought a 77-year-old arms dealer home for Christmas. \u201cThese all seem like pretty awful people, doll,\u201d he said, before returning to his John le Carr\u00e9 novel. But he didn\u2019t see what I saw. He didn\u2019t get to watch them with the night-vision camera on, snuggling up to their partners like lonely orphans tentatively seeking safety. They may mug and pose, calling girls \u201cfit\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d, but at the end of the day they are romantics, here to find a love so great it wins the nation\u2019s heart. Take the case of Anton Danyluk, a Scottish gym owner whose first month saw him repeatedly rejected, trying to sleep while his roommates dry-humped feet away from him. He was everyone\u2019s friend and, because an Adonis body in the villa is so common as to become cheap, he became a symbol of pathetic singledom, a millennial male Cathy cartoon. (Does that reference fly in the UK? The cartoon character who loved chocolate and was always on a diet and couldn\u2019t keep a man and popularised the word Ack!?) Then came Belle, a 21-year-old makeup artist who immediately announced that she knows she has amazing boobs. On the first night she and Anton shared a bed, she ran her acrylic nails down his stomach and it appeared that he prematurely ejaculated, which she found adorable. They entered into domestic bliss and a shocking image was broadcast: Belle shaving her new boyfriend\u2019s ass, something he had previously admitted his mother did for him (let\u2019s not start a conversation we can\u2019t finish). Within days, they were drunkenly fighting: he\u2019d given his number to a shopkeeper. She\u2019d mugged him off when she refused a fake wedding ring after he kissed Anna. He was immune to her pain as she screamed, \u201cI am who I am and I\u2019ll stand by that!\u201d In the end, the dumping of two other islanders brought them back together. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to be her own best advocate,\u201d my father said. But he was wrong. She didn\u2019t stand idly by as he snogged her friend. She didn\u2019t accept it, just to stay in the faux-warmth of an unhappy union. She wanted love, real love, honest love. She cried tears down her contouring. She wanted more, and when she yelled, \u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re wrong but you!\u201d, she got it. Up until now, I\u2019ve been fairly silent about why I love Love Island. To fully get why I was primed for it, you have to understand the time I\u2019ve had. Nineteen months ago, I left my first long-term relationship and endured a public breakup that wasn\u2019t as bad as Amy\u2019s but made me feel like Amber after Michael walked back into the villa with Joanna. I pulled a Lucie and immediately hurled myself at someone new, an explosive and uncomfortable five months, during which I was briefly engaged after being proposed to with the lace of a Timberland boot while snowed into my parents\u2019 apartment. I quickly realised I wasn\u2019t safe with this person and moved on to someone lovely, someone who took good care of me as I licked my wounds, and I hope I took good care of him. We spent the summer in Los Angeles. We went to the beach. We raised a kitten. We ate brunch and drove to the Griffith Observatory, but the gates were already closed so we made out in the car instead. Everything seemed perfect except the gnawing feeling that I had no idea who I was or what I was doing. I got sick, had surgery and woke up in intensive care, and realised I couldn\u2019t keep swinging from branch to branch. I\u2019d have to touch the ground. It was the nicest breakup I\u2019ve ever had. He called me \u201cdude\u201d and I knew we would stay friends, but I had to be alone for a while. A while turned out to be a few weeks, before I spent a few nights at a philosopher\u2019s house. But when he started a sentence with, \u201cYou know what women really don\u2019t understand?\u201d I was back out on the sidewalk, pinching myself. I spent a month in bed with my pets, reading Sylvia Plath. I went on one blind date with a scientist I didn\u2019t know lived with a girlfriend until she posted hostile watercolours of me on the internet. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t keep living this way.\u201d This time, I meant it. I came to Wales with all my art supplies and no lacy underwear. I had zero fantasies about summer romance. I hadn\u2019t had sex in seven months so I felt fine about eating all the Welsh cakes. (Have you tried them? It\u2019s like a pancake fucked a scone.) Out my window I can see sheep and cows, and if they\u2019re lying down I know my joints will ache that day, too \u2013 osteoarthritis is something they never talk about on Love Island. The nearby town is perfect. A pastiche of everything that appeals to me: pastel exteriors, canals bobbing with lily pads, a tiny, dusty art supply store called the Play Place, cobblestoned streets. The people who own our house are away with their grandkids for the summer and I am padding around in only my ex-boyfriend\u2019s T-shirt, though I cannot for the life of me remember which ex-boyfriend. This home is so familiar to me, as if I lived here in a past life \u2013 every carefully collected object, Regency and faux-Oriental, the seashells and tapestries, and a lot of art that says the names of the couple, engraved with hearts. They must be in love. Every morning I see fields and fields and fields, so green that I don\u2019t have the language for them; it\u2019s like the part of my brain that processes nature was eaten by the smell of the subway. This morning I wandered, bowl of pasta in hand, out to the back garden. I congratulated myself \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe I was outside, alone, by choice \u2013 and I was also full of wild fear. The moon was as big as I\u2019ve ever seen it and the sheep were asleep, presumably warm enough in their sheep outfits. I took a massive bite and when I looked up, the moon was gone. It was a moment that made the conflict so clear: do you consume or do you observe, do you feed yourself or do you make yourself present for life, can you do both? I am asking myself the same questions they ask themselves on Love Island, really. Can you love again after hurt? What does partnership mean? And what does it mean to know someone if you don\u2019t know yourself? But on Love Island the pain is mediated. Not by their beauty, not by their youth, but by the fact that they\u2019re living in a simulacrum, constantly observed though rarely acknowledging the observer. Many sensitive souls have a tendency to narrate their own life as if it were a movie, but few of us have our first love punctuated by theme music and a guy in a sound booth somewhere. Despite never being seen, the producers are always present: when the islanders have sex under the covers like some remote religious sect, they are really trying to avoid being seen and shaming their families. When they refrain from getting sloshed and screaming their pain to the night sky, it\u2019s because the alcohol is limited by network restrictions. And when one of their phones dings and they cry out, \u201cI got a teeext!\u201d, it\u2019s the hand of God determining what the next painful choice will be. Love Island is a fantasy world. In there, love is sped up and clarified. Proximity creates a propulsive romance without the aching stops and starts of traditional courtship. In this heteronormative fairytale, women are never too tired and men can never be truly cruel or abusive (though this season Michael has sure tried). Nobody can ghost you because they can\u2019t go anywhere. On Love Island, when someone cracks on with your former friend, you\u2019re still there. You\u2019re watching, either in the villa or back at home, having gained a million Instagram followers and a contract to promote swimwear, and so you never have to wonder where your ex is or what they are doing. Nobody is scrolling each other\u2019s Instagrams tearfully, because they\u2019re still in the neighbouring bed. I was haunted by my ex\u2019s new girlfriend wishing her favourite person a happy birthday, just as I once did, in a shirt my mother wore when she was pregnant with me and a hat I got him on a work trip to Florida. The islanders are haunted by swimming in the same pool. In that sense, they still belong to each other. Loss isn\u2019t real. What was amazing about what Amy did, by leaving, is that she broke the fourth wall. She acknowledged she had real feelings and that her heart was really broken, too. Like a child who has just been hit by the ball, she said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t fun any more.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to play the game. I hope that history properly commends her. I hope that Belle moves with Anton to Glasgow and they open a waxing salon. I hope Tommy and Molly-Mae have loads of children and teach them to love with the same ferocity that they do. I hope Amber knows her worth and Maura realises that when Curtis smiles, he looks like a Disney villain (Big Curtis Energy is when a man is so pleased with himself that he breaks into disco moves; it\u2019s a national crisis). I hope that Anna never throws Jordan over for someone taller again, and that we all learn a lesson from the egoless way that Jordan took her back, and the elegant way that Ovie conceded. I hope I meet someone who is OK with an infertile, chubby, controlling fantasist who has made a lot of mistakes but can\u2019t stop trying. I hope I can show my children what it means to love with intention, without losing oneself. I hope the villa is always full of smiling faces, hopeful hearts, tearful losses and ecstatic gains. I hope we can keep cracking on, into the future for ever. I hope that summer never ends. \u2022 Love Island concludes on ITV2 next week. Styling: Hope Lawrie. Hair and makeup: Bean Ellis.

His father, Harald Berg, had won 43 caps for Norway between 1964 and 1974 and played alongside Dick Advocaat for Den Haag in the Netherlands. Arild\u2019s two elder brothers, \u00d8rjan and Runar, went on to represent their country too and had long and distinguished careers in Norway and abroad.</p> <p>But Arild was the most talented of them all. \u201cArild Berg was well known as a footballing phenomenon long before breaking into the first squad at Bod\u00f8/Glimt,\u201d recalls the TV2 football pundit Per Angell Berntsen.</p> <p>Stian H\u00f8gland from the Bod\u00f8-based newspaper <em>Avisa Nordland </em>says Arild possessed \u201cincredible technique and great vision.

He made his first team debut for Bod\u00f8/Glimt in Norway\u2019s top division at the age of 17 wearing Harry Potter-style glasses, and quickly went on to become one of the league\u2019s best players over the next three years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fde42bb3842e7baad195d512c2234e44e4d9d84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fde42bb3842e7baad195d512c2234e44e4d9d84/0_0_1969_1464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berg burst onto the scene as a thrilling young talent similar to Andres Iniesta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berg burst onto the scene as a thrilling young talent similar to Andres Iniesta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon-Inge Moen/Scanpix Norway/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every top club in Norway wanted him but then, in 1996, he suddenly retired. It was as if Michael Owen, or any other top footballer at the height of their powers for that matter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/23/joy-of-six-footballers-who-voluntarily-retired-in-their-20s\" title=\"\">had quit football at the age of 20 for no apparent reason</a>. Berg said long afterwards that he needed to regain his passion for football, to find out whether it was his true love.</p> <p>That quest to recover his passion for the game led him to try around 15 different sports, including snowboarding and diving. But after a year he was ready to return. \u201cI got tired of losing in tennis every other day. I wanted to win again,\u201d <a href=\"https://bodonu.no/det-interessante-med-meg-er-ikke-min-fotballkarriere-men-at-jeg-er-den-i-norge-som-kan-me\" title=\"\">he told Bod\u00f8 Nu in 2018</a>.</p> <p>However, his return was surprising, as he joined the Nordland club Gevir Bod\u00f8 in the third tier. That season he enthralled the local fans with his outlandish skills and seemed happy again but that year, 1997, was also the year he recognised that something did not feel right. \u201cI remember sitting in the dressing room after the last game of the season,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.recoverynorge.org/2019/01/20/arild-berg-me-cfs/\" title=\"\">he told Recovery Norway</a>. \u201cWe won but I was sitting in a corner and my heart rate would just not go down. It just carried on at 160. And that was just the start.\u201d</p> <p>He rejoined Bod\u00f8/Glimt in 1998 but his body was shutting down and he was forced to train less and less. The following year he practically did no training at all, only turning out for games, but his talent was so precocious that he was still widely considered the best player in Norway\u2019s top division. As Berntsen says: \u201cIt was quite remarkable that Arild was the best player in Norway during the 1999 season because he was playing for a mid-table club while Rosenborg were at their absolute peak, dominating in Norway and even doing well in the Champions League. And he did this despite being ill and not training.\u201d</p> <p>Berg\u2019s condition \u2013 at this stage undiagnosed \u2013 gradually deteriorated. At one point he had lost 15kg, dropping from 75 to 60kg. He signed for Lyn, the club where his father once won the league, for a fresh start but was forced to retire at the age of 25. By this stage he was travelling around the world trying to find someone who could accurately diagnose what was ailing him. Suggestions that he was suffering from mercury poisoning proved to be incorrect. \u201cI spent about two million kroner [more than \u00a3180,000] on doctors and various healers for more than a decade,\u201d Berg told Bod\u00f8 Nu last year.</p> <p>For a long time he harboured hopes of returning to competitive football but when the reason for his struggles was finally identified his dream was cruelly dashed. Football, it turned out, was in many ways the cause of his illness. In 2005 Berg was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. The medical condition, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis \u2013 or more commonly, ME \u2013 can be caused by a myriad of factors but for Berg it became apparent that football, and the attendant stress that it brought, was the main reason.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bde4eb9003aec25dee504f4838fe06d3529bb61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bde4eb9003aec25dee504f4838fe06d3529bb61e/0_205_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Berg\u2019s final farewell was held in Bod\u00f8 cathedral this summer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berg\u2019s final farewell was held in Bod\u00f8 cathedral this summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tore Meek/Scanpix Norway/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ironically, considering he had travelled the world seeking a cure, it was a local doctor, Arne Stenstr\u00f8m, who identified the problem. Stenstr\u00f8m, himself diagnosed with ME, was able to recognise the problems Berg was facing and after several meetings, told the former footballer in 2009 that he had to cut all ties with football.</p> <p>For Berg it suddenly all made sense. \u201cI said goodbye to football,\u201d he told Recovery Norway. \u201cI deleted any trace of it. Football had triggered the illness. I kept away from all football in the media and distanced myself from friends who wrote about football on Facebook. In the summer of 2010 I tried to watch a World Cup game but when I did there was a violent sense of stress and the old symptoms came back to me. But this time I knew why I felt like I did. There was no mystique. I knew what I had to do and it quickly disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>Berg explained why he had ME and his brothers did not: \u201cFrom when I was a kid I had trained twice as much as everyone else. Since my father and my brothers had achieved so much on the pitch it is possible that I always had this pressure on me. But as I have understood it, the stress was as much triggered by the excitement and enthusiasm. And an expectation of something that I could possibly achieve. What happened with me was that I was never turned off.\u201d</p> <p>Berg was gradually able to rebuild his life. He was happier, was able to exercise again and, perhaps most importantly, was able to help other ME sufferers through his experiences and ability to identify with them. But Berg encountered other problems \u2013 and in June he took his own life, aged 43.</p> <p>His passing serves as a reminder that with great talent comes pressure that some find impossible to manage. \u201cWe all want to be gifted but that doesn\u2019t suit everyone,\u201d wrote Berntsen after Berg\u2019s death. \u201cFor Arild Berg, his incredible talent was also his curse. It is much easier to be average, because you don\u2019t have to live with high expectations \u2013 not just those of others, but first and foremost your own.\u201d</p> <p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

He made his first team debut for Bod\u00f8/Glimt in Norway\u2019s top division at the age of 17 wearing Harry Potter-style glasses, and quickly went on to become one of the league\u2019s best players over the next three years. Every top club in Norway wanted him but then, in 1996, he suddenly retired. It was as if Michael Owen, or any other top footballer at the height of their powers for that matter, had quit football at the age of 20 for no apparent reason. Berg said long afterwards that he needed to regain his passion for football, to find out whether it was his true love. That quest to recover his passion for the game led him to try around 15 different sports, including snowboarding and diving. But after a year he was ready to return. \u201cI got tired of losing in tennis every other day. I wanted to win again,\u201d he told Bod\u00f8 Nu in 2018. However, his return was surprising, as he joined the Nordland club Gevir Bod\u00f8 in the third tier. That season he enthralled the local fans with his outlandish skills and seemed happy again but that year, 1997, was also the year he recognised that something did not feel right. \u201cI remember sitting in the dressing room after the last game of the season,\u201d he told Recovery Norway. \u201cWe won but I was sitting in a corner and my heart rate would just not go down. It just carried on at 160. And that was just the start.\u201d He rejoined Bod\u00f8/Glimt in 1998 but his body was shutting down and he was forced to train less and less. The following year he practically did no training at all, only turning out for games, but his talent was so precocious that he was still widely considered the best player in Norway\u2019s top division. As Berntsen says: \u201cIt was quite remarkable that Arild was the best player in Norway during the 1999 season because he was playing for a mid-table club while Rosenborg were at their absolute peak, dominating in Norway and even doing well in the Champions League. And he did this despite being ill and not training.\u201d Berg\u2019s condition \u2013 at this stage undiagnosed \u2013 gradually deteriorated. At one point he had lost 15kg, dropping from 75 to 60kg. He signed for Lyn, the club where his father once won the league, for a fresh start but was forced to retire at the age of 25. By this stage he was travelling around the world trying to find someone who could accurately diagnose what was ailing him. Suggestions that he was suffering from mercury poisoning proved to be incorrect. \u201cI spent about two million kroner [more than \u00a3180,000] on doctors and various healers for more than a decade,\u201d Berg told Bod\u00f8 Nu last year. For a long time he harboured hopes of returning to competitive football but when the reason for his struggles was finally identified his dream was cruelly dashed. Football, it turned out, was in many ways the cause of his illness. In 2005 Berg was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. The medical condition, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis \u2013 or more commonly, ME \u2013 can be caused by a myriad of factors but for Berg it became apparent that football, and the attendant stress that it brought, was the main reason. Ironically, considering he had travelled the world seeking a cure, it was a local doctor, Arne Stenstr\u00f8m, who identified the problem. Stenstr\u00f8m, himself diagnosed with ME, was able to recognise the problems Berg was facing and after several meetings, told the former footballer in 2009 that he had to cut all ties with football. For Berg it suddenly all made sense. \u201cI said goodbye to football,\u201d he told Recovery Norway. \u201cI deleted any trace of it. Football had triggered the illness. I kept away from all football in the media and distanced myself from friends who wrote about football on Facebook. In the summer of 2010 I tried to watch a World Cup game but when I did there was a violent sense of stress and the old symptoms came back to me. But this time I knew why I felt like I did. There was no mystique. I knew what I had to do and it quickly disappeared.\u201d Berg explained why he had ME and his brothers did not: \u201cFrom when I was a kid I had trained twice as much as everyone else. Since my father and my brothers had achieved so much on the pitch it is possible that I always had this pressure on me. But as I have understood it, the stress was as much triggered by the excitement and enthusiasm. And an expectation of something that I could possibly achieve. What happened with me was that I was never turned off.\u201d Berg was gradually able to rebuild his life. He was happier, was able to exercise again and, perhaps most importantly, was able to help other ME sufferers through his experiences and ability to identify with them. But Berg encountered other problems \u2013 and in June he took his own life, aged 43. His passing serves as a reminder that with great talent comes pressure that some find impossible to manage. \u201cWe all want to be gifted but that doesn\u2019t suit everyone,\u201d wrote Berntsen after Berg\u2019s death. \u201cFor Arild Berg, his incredible talent was also his curse. It is much easier to be average, because you don\u2019t have to live with high expectations \u2013 not just those of others, but first and foremost your own.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "body": "<p>It was my son\u2019s birthday party last weekend. His birthday isn\u2019t until mid-August, but you can\u2019t have a party then, unless you have it in Tenerife. Our child is one of the youngest in his year group. The only literature I\u2019ve read on this suggests that he will spend his life at the bottom of the class, underperforming in sports, a pattern that will continue into his adult life and prevent him from achieving any great success. This is bad news for him, but means we are liberated from worrying that it\u2019s us who ruined him.</p> <p>We were hoping, for a change, to host a kids\u2019 party that didn\u2019t ruin the weekend \u2013 always a monster of logistics, but now complicated by having a package of mini demons entrusted to our care for two-and-a-half hours. Children\u2019s parties throw up so many issues, the first being who gets to come. My wife and I didn\u2019t think this mattered \u2013 if our children aren\u2019t invited to a party, we remind them that there is nothing better in life than not having to go somewhere. But then there are the parents who remember if you didn\u2019t invite their child to a birthday party back in year 1, sentencing us to a lifetime of scowls at the school drop-off. A small price to pay, I would argue.</p> <p>The other issue is behaviour. Recently, I was at a birthday party with one of ours and saw a mother push him. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I marched straight over, and as I approached was struck by how strangely she was dressed for a woman her age. It was then I realised that she was a very tall girl in my son\u2019s year. This raised a number of complications. First, I was going to have to tell off a girl who all my instincts were telling me was a woman in her mid-20s. Secondly, if the girl was this size at seven years old, I could only imagine her parents were 8ft tall and ready to beat the shit out of me if I upset their daughter. I took the coward\u2019s way out and ushered my child away while apologising to her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/13/road-rage-even-lovely-people-romesh-ranganathan\">Romesh Ranganathan: even the loveliest people get road rage \u2013 my mum included</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyway, my wife is the hero of this piece. Not only did she foresee the exact amount of food required, and what the kids would like, while hunting out the party bag items with the greatest cost to kids-go-wow ratio, she also bought prosecco. I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 so far, so very middle class, Romesh. There is a whole article to be written in which I would reject that assertion, but the effect of the prosecco was miraculous. It made all the parents stay. Plus, it felt like a summer party, regardless of whether people were drinking or not, and everyone was in a good mood. Parents were less combative when we had to say things like, \u201cWould you mind asking your son to stop punching the entertainer in the dick?\u201d</p> <p>I am loth to promote a pro-alcohol message, particularly as I am off the sauce at the moment. But my advice is this: a stress-free kids party is like a Pixar movie \u2013 there should be stuff for both kids and adults to enjoy. A great party then, until I made the rookie error of allowing the boy to open his presents without keeping an eye on who gave him what. This means we are completely unable to give out meaningful thank-you cards. I didn\u2019t think that was a big deal, but my wife tells me we will have to move house.</p>",

We were hoping, for a change, to host a kids\u2019 party that didn\u2019t ruin the weekend \u2013 always a monster of logistics, but now complicated by having a package of mini demons entrusted to our care for two-and-a-half hours. Children\u2019s parties throw up so many issues, the first being who gets to come. My wife and I didn\u2019t think this mattered \u2013 if our children aren\u2019t invited to a party, we remind them that there is nothing better in life than not having to go somewhere. But then there are the parents who remember if you didn\u2019t invite their child to a birthday party back in year 1, sentencing us to a lifetime of scowls at the school drop-off. A small price to pay, I would argue. The other issue is behaviour. Recently, I was at a birthday party with one of ours and saw a mother push him. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I marched straight over, and as I approached was struck by how strangely she was dressed for a woman her age. It was then I realised that she was a very tall girl in my son\u2019s year. This raised a number of complications. First, I was going to have to tell off a girl who all my instincts were telling me was a woman in her mid-20s. Secondly, if the girl was this size at seven years old, I could only imagine her parents were 8ft tall and ready to beat the shit out of me if I upset their daughter. I took the coward\u2019s way out and ushered my child away while apologising to her. Anyway, my wife is the hero of this piece. Not only did she foresee the exact amount of food required, and what the kids would like, while hunting out the party bag items with the greatest cost to kids-go-wow ratio, she also bought prosecco. I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 so far, so very middle class, Romesh. There is a whole article to be written in which I would reject that assertion, but the effect of the prosecco was miraculous. It made all the parents stay. Plus, it felt like a summer party, regardless of whether people were drinking or not, and everyone was in a good mood. Parents were less combative when we had to say things like, \u201cWould you mind asking your son to stop punching the entertainer in the dick?\u201d I am loth to promote a pro-alcohol message, particularly as I am off the sauce at the moment. But my advice is this: a stress-free kids party is like a Pixar movie \u2013 there should be stuff for both kids and adults to enjoy. A great party then, until I made the rookie error of allowing the boy to open his presents without keeping an eye on who gave him what. This means we are completely unable to give out meaningful thank-you cards. I didn\u2019t think that was a big deal, but my wife tells me we will have to move house.",

The survey also found that 39% of people believe the UK-wide system should include more materials, such as drinks cartons and pouches.</p> <p>Maddy Haughton-Boakes, litter campaigner for CPRE, said: \u201cWith Michael Gove having thrown his weight behind a truly \u2018all-in\u2019 deposit return system, and with the Scottish government\u2019s decision to introduce one earlier this year, this latest wave of public support is surely all the evidence needed for the government to get this over the line.\u201d</p> <p>Norway has already established an effective deposit system that has led to the country achieving a recycling rate for this type of waste <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/12/can-norway-help-us-solve-the-plastic-crisis-one-bottle-at-a-time\">as high as 95%</a>, while recycling rates in other countries have also risen after introducing similar schemes. In the UK, overall recycling has <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/784263/UK_Statistics_on_Waste_statistical_notice_March_2019_rev_FINAL.pdf\">plateaued at around 45%.</a></p> <p>A deposit system could change this. This month, the CPRE reported that an \u201call-in\u201d deposit return system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/11/bolder-bottle-return-scheme-could-be-worth-2bn-say-campaigners\">could generate \u00a32bn</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/11/bolder-bottle-return-scheme-could-be-worth-2bn-say-campaigners\"> for the economy</a> over 10 years, as detailed in the government\u2019s own impact assessment.

      "bodyText": "Almost three-quarters of Britons would support a nationwide deposit return system for plastic and glass drinks bottles and aluminium cans, a survey has found. The results follow the announcement last week during a speech at London\u2019s Kew Gardens by Michael Gove, then environment secretary, in which he expressed support for a comprehensive deposit return system. In his speech, Gove suggested that \u201can \u2018all-in\u2019 model will give consumers the greatest possible incentive to recycle\u201d. The all-in model would see a small charge added to the cost of drinks containers made from glass, PET plastic, aluminium and steel. When the empty container is returned to a collection point to be recycled, the charge would be refunded. In Scotland, the government has already committed to introduce a deposit system for glass, steel and aluminium drinks containers of all sizes. A third of people surveyed by YouGov for the Campaign to Protect Rural England believe that the UK-wide system should be just as comprehensive as Scottish system. The survey also found that 39% of people believe the UK-wide system should include more materials, such as drinks cartons and pouches. Maddy Haughton-Boakes, litter campaigner for CPRE, said: \u201cWith Michael Gove having thrown his weight behind a truly \u2018all-in\u2019 deposit return system, and with the Scottish government\u2019s decision to introduce one earlier this year, this latest wave of public support is surely all the evidence needed for the government to get this over the line.\u201d Norway has already established an effective deposit system that has led to the country achieving a recycling rate for this type of waste as high as 95%, while recycling rates in other countries have also risen after introducing similar schemes. In the UK, overall recycling has plateaued at around 45%. A deposit system could change this. This month, the CPRE reported that an \u201call-in\u201d deposit return system could generate \u00a32bn for the economy over 10 years, as detailed in the government\u2019s own impact assessment. This economic boost would come from a reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill, fewer littered drinks containers and associated cleanup costs, reduced air and water pollution, and less carbon emissions caused by the extraction and production of raw materials needed to produce new drinks containers. Haughton-Boakes said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fantastic that so many people have shown such high levels of support for the scheme before its even been introduced. \u201cA deposit return system will transform the way we deal with waste, boost recycling and as a result, finally put a stop to the harm that drinks containers are causing our countryside, environment and wildlife.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Portugal: Ribatejo</h2> <p><em><strong>Silvia Bastos, 46, from Lisbon</strong></em></p> <p>Every year we spend two weeks in our house in Ribatejo province, in a village called <strong>Moreiras Grandes</strong>, 12km south-west of the town of <strong>Tomar</strong>, central Portugal. The house belonged to my great-grandmother and I went there every summer as a child. Now I want my own children, aged 12 and nine, to have a connection to the land. We plant trees, pick grapes from our vines. They have a freedom there that they don\u2019t have in the city.</p> <p>Very few foreign visitors make it here and most Portuguese prefer to go to the beach, so it is very quiet. It\u2019s much greener than the Alentejo, to the south \u2013 people sometimes call Ribatejo the Tuscany of Portugal \u2013 and it\u2019s also cooler than the south. The nights are usually fresh. When we bring friends here they can\u2019t believe how beautiful it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66eb5092a045a9bfc28acee9f162fa37d98fa424\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66eb5092a045a9bfc28acee9f162fa37d98fa424/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silvia Bastos and family on holiday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silvia Bastos and family on holiday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the best things to do is spend the day by the Z\u00eazere River or <strong>Castelo do Bode</strong>, a 66km-long lake formed in the 1950s when the river was dammed. In the past few years the lake has become more geared up for tourism and now there are places offering water sports, such as wake boarding at Lago Azul in the town of <strong>Ferreria do Z\u00eazere</strong>.</p> <p>An unexpected attraction is the famed <a href=\"http://www.pegadasdedinossaurios.org/html/monumento_uk.htm\" title=\"\">dinosaur footprints at </a><strong><a href=\"http://www.pegadasdedinossaurios.org/html/monumento_uk.htm\" title=\"\">Pedreira do Galinha</a></strong>, 20km west of Tomar, discovered in 1994.</p> <p>Tomar<strong> </strong>itself is beautiful, with one of the best monuments in the country \u2013 the vast, Unesco-listed <strong>Convent of Christ</strong>, originally a 12th-century Templar stronghold. It\u2019s surrounded by castle walls and its various cloisters were built over several centuries, in different architectural styles. </p> <p>We usually eat at home because we have planted so many fruit trees and plants, as well as vines, and it\u2019s great to eat \u2013 and drink \u2013 what we grow, but in Tomar there\u2019s a fun medieval-themed restaurant, <a href=\"http://tavernaantiqua.com/\" title=\"\">Taverna Antiqua</a>, that serves traditional dishes, like boar with wild berries. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/grelhadozezere/\" title=\"\">Grelha do Z\u00eazere</a> in Ferreria do Z\u00eazere is also great \u2013 it serves regional cuisine, especially grilled meat.</p> <p>Tomar and the river are jewels of Portugal, yet few people explore them.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Stay at <a href=\"http://www.anunciadavelha.pt/#!__english\" title=\"\">Quinta da Anunciada</a> (doubles \u20ac65-90), a historic country house</em><em> with </em><em>pool, 2km from Tomar<br></em><strong>Interview by Isabel Choat</strong></p> <h2>Czech Republic: Orlick\u00e9 mountains</h2> <p><em><strong>Ond\u0159ej Vach, 36, from Prague</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b1f7f32fee633fc2bcb12baa2687d172aaa1de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b1f7f32fee633fc2bcb12baa2687d172aaa1de8/0_262_3918_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jana and daughter near Pastivny Dam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jana and daughter near Pastivny Dam</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I spent my childhood holidays at my grandfather\u2019s cottage in the <strong>Orlick\u00e9 mountains</strong>, and though I have always lived in Prague, it\u2019s the place I consider my true home.</p> <p>The region, about a two-hour drive east of the capital, is attractive yet very humble, full of forests, cycle paths and nature reserves \u2013 and completely under the radar. There are no big hotels or expensive restaurants; it\u2019s a peripheral tourist area where Czechs walk or have fun in the wild river \u2013 and that\u2019s why I like it.</p> <p>I have been returning there with my wife, Jana, since I met her in 2012, and now that we have two small daughters \u2013 Jani\u010dka, aged three, and Kl\u00e1rka, three months \u2013 we head there for our family holiday each summer.</p> <p>The iconic symbol of Orlick\u00e9 is undoubtedly <strong>Masaryk\u2019s Chalet </strong>(<em>Masarykova chata na \u0160erlicku</em>), a three-storey green cottage built in the mid-1920s in honour of the first president of Czechoslovakia, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk. During the second world war it was seized and used as a place of recovery for injured Nazi pilots, then the communists occupied it until after the revolution in 1989. It\u2019s a fascinating site to walk to, with peaceful, unspoiled nature all around \u2013 and you can <a href=\"https://www.ubytovani-serlich.cz/\" title=\"\">stay in</a><a href=\"https://www.ubytovani-serlich.cz/\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.ubytovani-serlich.cz/\" title=\"\">lodge-style rooms</a> for a good price, too (\u20ac14pp with breakfast).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6875f990c2fc0fff383026cdf0e11fd0e76fba75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6875f990c2fc0fff383026cdf0e11fd0e76fba75/172_0_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Pastviny dam, Czech Republic.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pastviny Dam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <strong>Pastviny Dam</strong> (Vodn\u00ed n\u00e1dr\u017e Pastviny), on the Divok\u00e1 Orlice river, is another great place to visit, especially with kids. It\u2019s 6km long, and is the last stone-made dam in the Czech Republic. It\u2019s incredibly beautiful. My grandpa\u2019s cottage was in this valley, it\u2019s where I learned to swim. You can hire rowing or pedal boats, or just splash around in the clear water.</p> <p>A good base for exploring the region, and where we usually stay, is <strong>\u017damberk</strong>, known as the gateway to the Orlick\u00e9 mountains. It\u2019s a modest but pretty town with a rural atmosphere.</p> <p>There are two great restaurants \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.imrvere-zamberk.cz/\" title=\"\">Imrvere</a>, a very typical Czech restaurant, which does excellent roast duck with dumplings, and <a href=\"http://www.pivovarzamberk.cz/\" title=\"\">Kanec</a>, which is also the local brewery pub. The name means wild boar, and I often head there for their strong, unfiltered lager and a plate of <em>utopenec </em>(pickled sausage).</p> <p>Oh, and do you know the British band Reef? Singer Gary Stringer and bassist Jack Bessant played at \u017damberk\u2019s JamRock festival a few years ago and were so impressed by the area they wrote a song called Road to \u017damberk \u2013 then came back and played the festival for free the following year!<br><strong>Interview by Mark Pickering</strong></p> <h2>Denmark: Helgen\u00e6s peninsula, Jutland</h2> <p><em><strong>Esben Thorup, 37, from Copenhagen</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a80b9da74735be9c0598b5028a804185af5947aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a80b9da74735be9c0598b5028a804185af5947aa/0_67_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old houses on a cobbled street in Ebeltoft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old houses on a cobbled street in Ebeltoft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many Danes, my grandfather bought a plot of land in the 1950s to build a summerhouse on. The <strong>Helgen\u00e6s peninsula </strong>is pretty rural \u2013 it\u2019s known locally as the \u201csnot drip\u201d of Jutland (there\u2019s a bump on the east coast that looks a little like a nose). It\u2019s so off the beaten track that most Danes have never even heard of it. There are lots of fields around and it\u2019s surprisingly hilly for Denmark. Some say it looks a little like Scotland.</p> <p>The house was built with two tiny bedrooms, one for my grandfather and grandmother and the other for my dad and my uncle to share, as well as a kitchen, a living room and a toilet. That was it \u2013 no bath, you just washed in the sea, 100 metres away. Because it\u2019s on the east coast, the water is calm and it\u2019s great for swimming. When I was small my family would spend three weeks here every summer. We swam, ate strawberries and ice-cream and the sun was always shining \u2013 at least that\u2019s how I remember it. It isn\u2019t fancy (although we did install an indoor shower in the 1990s) but I love it \u2013 my wife and I even got married here.</p> <p>We drive over from Copenhagen every summer with our three kids \u2013 aged one, four and seven \u2013 to spend time with my parents, my brothers and their families, and my uncle\u2019s family. My dad built another small house on the same plot to fit everyone in, but there\u2019s usually still someone sleeping on the sofa or the floor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdee2e2e8536ea03ebfb501e81fa2efdd1b8f8e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdee2e2e8536ea03ebfb501e81fa2efdd1b8f8e4/0_167_2808_1685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esben Thorup and son in Jutland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esben Thorup and son in Jutland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not a lot goes on here \u2013 but that\u2019s part of the attraction. To get to the house you have to go down an overgrown track, and there\u2019s hardly any phone signal. We spend our time swimming, talking, walking and barbecuing. There are a few local artists \u2013 potters and painters mainly \u2013 who sell work from their houses. You can go windsurfing and there\u2019s even <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/djurssurferen/\" title=\"\">an annual surf festival</a>. There\u2019s also fishing, kitesurfing and paragliding \u2013 the steep slopes leading to the beach give great uplift for catching the wind.</p> <p>If we\u2019re ever in need of fancier attractions, we go to <strong>Ebletoft</strong>, an old port town 30 minutes\u2019 drive away with a population of around 7,000 (this is \u201cthe big town\u201d). There are a few visitor sites there, such as the glass museum, <a href=\"https://glasmuseet.dk/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Glasmuseet Ebeltoft</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fregatten-jylland.dk/\" title=\"\">Fregatten Jylland</a>, which houses the world\u2019s longest wooden ship. It\u2019s also nice to just stroll around Ebeltoft\u2019s old streets; sometimes we\u2019ll get some craft beer from <a href=\"http://www.ebeltoftgaardbryggeri.dk/\" title=\"\">Ebeltoft brewery</a> \u2013 they do a nice IPA.</p> <p>We eat pretty simply when at the summerhouse \u2013 we might pick up some salad leaves, new potatoes or fruit grown from the produce stands with honesty boxes dotted along the roads. And there\u2019s a small fishing hut at the top of the peninsula where a fisherman and his son smoke fish and sell great seafood.</p> <p>I wish I could tell you what it was called and how to get hold of them, but the hut doesn\u2019t even have a name, let alone a website.

It was a safe area for my twin brother Davor and me to go, because it hadn\u2019t been affected by the war. A cousin of ours had bought a piece of land nearby and said, \u201cOh, you have to come and see this little town. It\u2019s magical.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s so special about this peninsula, <strong>Kamenjak</strong>, is that there is untouched nature and untouched beautiful beaches. It\u2019s the only part of Istria that has a proper Mediterranean climate \u2013 completely different from anything else.</p> <p>At the far end of the peninsula are 10 to and 15-metre-high cliffs that you can jump off. There are also caves, a lighthouse and, apparently, dinosaur footprints. When we were kids we found it fascinating. It still feels magical. You take your bike or walk, to find spots where you can be on your own and not see anyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"570227eb7372a73ae3eee920165db60ab22a7aba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570227eb7372a73ae3eee920165db60ab22a7aba/144_515_1016_610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Dragojlovic with twin brother Davor, friend Ivana and her son in Istria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Dragojlovic with twin brother Davor, friend Ivana and her son in Istria</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A favourite beach is <strong>Velika Kolombarica</strong>, whose cliffs are often featured in Croatian tourism ads. Just above it is the <a href=\"https://www.premantura.net/item/safari-bar-kamenjak-premantura/\" title=\"\">Safari Bar</a>, which has a great story. This Croatian guy who used to work in Switzerland decided to live like Robinson Crusoe, so he made this bar out of practically nothing, just materials he found on the peninsula, or in the sea. We walk down to Kolombarica, jump off the cliff, go to a cave, and then go back to the bar for a drink.</p> <p>We usually cook at home but sometimes we\u2019ll go inland to villages that do truffles and homemade pasta. Istria is the land of truffles. In <strong>Banjole</strong>, up the coast towards Pula, there\u2019s a restaurant called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Batelina/202005836507281\" title=\"\">Batelina</a> where the chef creates dishes using types of fish and seafood that fishermen would normally throw away. It also does amazing pasta and <em>bottarga</em> (cured fish roe).</p> <p>Most of the accommodation in Premantura is private apartments and villas, but the recently opened <a href=\"http://premantura-resort.hr/\" title=\"\">Premantura Resort</a> has a pool and doubles from \u20ac85-\u20ac175 B&amp;B.</p> <p>We come to Premantura every August with my parents and grandmother, and we still have friends we met here when we were young kids.

It\u2019s only 130km west of Barcelona but it feels a world away from the city and the crowded beach resorts.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been coming to Guimer\u00e0 for as long as I can remember. My great-grandfather was the mayor there, and my father was born in the house where we stay each summer. In the winter only a couple of hundred people live there but in the summer it\u2019s full of families, almost all of them with a connection to the village going back generations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"158645aaa908be47b94302b7745fdacf702e956c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/158645aaa908be47b94302b7745fdacf702e956c/665_407_4051_2431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisa Minguella and family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisa Minguella and family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annette Pacey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I was a child, I would spend the entire school summer holidays in Guimer\u00e0 with my brothers and my grandmother. I had complete freedom to stay out all day with my friends, and I encourage my girls to do the same now. They love the novelty of going to the bakery on their own to buy bread.</p> <p>In August, my whole family gathers in the village: my parents, my two brothers, uncles and my cousins with their families. It can get pretty crowded in the house, Cal Belleta. Every house in the village has a name and that\u2019s how we know which extended family people belong to. People ask: <em>\u201cDe quina casa ets?\u201d</em> (Which house are you from?)</p> <p>There aren\u2019t any hotels in Guimer\u00e0 but it\u2019s possible to rent a large house for far less than it would cost in more touristy places. <strong>Cal Caig</strong> (sleeps 11, on <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/16550750?amp%3Bshared_item_type=1&amp;amp%3Bvirality_entry_point=1&amp;amp%3Bsharer_id=12&amp;_set_bev_on_new_domain=1556794570_uwCUfyQWnrY9SxJY&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1562760196_NQYpUW1n60APsatb\" title=\"\">airbnb.com</a>) for \u20ac120 a night; and <strong><a href=\"https://www.guimera.info/web/calanxica/index.htm\" title=\"\">Ca l\u2019Anxica</a> </strong>(sleeps 12) with a private pool is \u20ac290 a night (for up to eight people) or \u20ac360 a night for up to 12. </p> <p>The best way to discover the local countryside is on foot via one of the many walking trails. My favourite goes along the river Corb, passing the ruins of <strong><a href=\"http://www.guimera.cat/el-municipi/turisme/rutes/la-bovera-i-el-riu-corb-sl-sender-local\" title=\"\">Convent de Vallsanta</a></strong>. There are also many places in the area to enjoy traditional Catalan food \u2013 we go to <strong><a href=\"http://calfeliuet.es/restaurante\" title=\"\">Cal Feliuet</a></strong> in nearby <strong>Belltall</strong>, where we always order snails.</p> <p>The day out we love the most is at the <strong><a href=\"https://guimeramedieval.cat/\" title=\"\">medieval market of Guimer\u00e0</a></strong>, which is held on the second weekend of August (10-11 Aug 2019). Everyone from the village dresses up in medieval costumes and each street is dedicated to a traditional trade, such as glassmaking. At night we put on a play based on a story from the history of the village, followed by fireworks from the tower. For me, the best part of the event is the way everybody comes together to make it happen. It\u2019s that sense of community that will keep us coming back to Guimer\u00e0.<br><strong>Interview by Annette Pacey</strong></p> <h2>Italy: Capo Circeo, Lazio</h2> <p><em><strong>Federica Cannone, 42, from Rome</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"72dd43e79b5e53c555ccd0813b7e6f5d133fa159\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72dd43e79b5e53c555ccd0813b7e6f5d133fa159/0_250_3968_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stabilimento Saporetti, near San Felice Circeo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stabilimento Saporetti, near San Felice Circeo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stabilimento Saporetti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father has a house in <strong>Borgo Montenero</strong>, a small village 100km south of Rome in a pine wood surrounded by fields of watermelons and strawberries. The place is super quiet but there\u2019s a farmers\u2019 market every weekend, an excellent little pizzeria called La Pizza in Piazza, and a grocery store and post office.</p> <p>The charming coastal town of <strong>San Felice Circeo</strong> is 10 minutes\u2019 drive away, home to Spiaggia Capo Circeo beach, a sandy strip of <em>stabilimenti balneari</em> (quintessentially Italian beach clubs with rows of sunbeds and umbrellas). It gets fully booked in August, often by families who have been going for generations, so my husband and I go round the headland to <strong>Saporetti</strong> beach, right by Monte Circeo. Its restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/saporettitorrepaola/\" title=\"\">Ristorante Saporetti</a>, is on the beach: I always go for the salad ni\u00e7oise and, in the evening, fantastic (if a tad pricey) fish dishes. We like coming here because we know pretty much everyone now, from other families to the lifeguard, Carmelo, who\u2019s been there for decades, and the owners of the stabilimento.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af7f89898bc0aaca5b6d95f23b201d0eb7f48e2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af7f89898bc0aaca5b6d95f23b201d0eb7f48e2a/4_0_900_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Federerica\u2019s children, Giulia and Francesco, at Cape Circeo\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federerica\u2019s children, Giulia and Francesco, at Cape Circeo</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The area is relatively unknown to foreign visitors, who tend to head further south to the Amalfi coast or stay much closer to Rome, in Ostia. It\u2019s a shame: Circeo is super-easy to get to (you can be here in just over 1\u00bd hours from Rome) and it really has some beautiful beaches and pristine water \u2013 the area has been awarded a blue flag for the past three years.</p> <p>There are plenty of places to stay: lots of <em>agriturismi</em> or B&amp;Bs. One of my favourites is <strong><a href=\"http://www.poderebedin.it/\" title=\"\">Podere Bedin</a></strong> (doubles \u20ac75-110); the owners are friendly and the restaurant uses local products.</p> <p>The area is part of <strong>Circeo </strong><strong>national </strong><strong>park</strong>, which runs along the coast of Lazio, spanning forests, marshes, sand dunes, Lake Paola, the island of <strong>Zannone </strong>and stunning sand dunes. The <a href=\"http://www.istpangea.it/\" title=\"\">Istituto Pangea Onlus</a> offers trails and trekking excursions as part of its eco-educational programme, and there\u2019s also cave diving, lots of cycling routes, and kayaking. Water Life, a company owned by local B&amp;B <a href=\"http://www.proprietascalfati.it/\" title=\"\">Propriet\u00e1 Scalfati</a>, (doubles from \u20ac140) is our go-to for kayaking trips. You can also get to <strong>Ponza</strong>, the largest island in the Pontine archipelago, in just an hour from the port of San Felice Circeo (boats depart everyday at around 10am).</p> <p>Circeo\u2019s food and drink are also a big draw. We always go to Cantina Sant\u2019Andrea, not far from Borgo Montenero, where you can fill your own wine bottle straight from huge casks. Aperitivos are cheap and well-done pretty much anywhere you go. We usually go to Saporetti\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stbar.saporetti/?rf=112389335519591\" title=\"\">St Bar</a> for an aperol spritz at sunset, and we really like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tikimaki.it/\" title=\"\">Tiki</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/La-Terrazza/466780300373782\" title=\"\">La Terrazza</a>, too \u2013 both in the old town of San Felice Circeo.</p> <p>If we aren\u2019t eating at home, we tend to go to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ilgrottinocirceo\" title=\"\">Il Grottino</a>, which has branches in the old town and the port.

We always have the <em>bl\u00e9 noir</em> (buckwheat) cr\u00eape: a <em>compl\u00e8te</em> (ham, eggs and cheese) or a <em>caramel au beurre sal\u00e9</em> from <a href=\"http://www.lamisaine.fr/\" title=\"\">La Misaine</a>. If we want seafood, we have a plate of langoustines \u2013 Sainte-Marine is the French capital of langoustines, which locals affectionately call <em>demoiselles </em>(maidens). The day\u2019s catch still comes in at 4pm, heralded by squawking seagulls, so we always go down to see what the<em> c\u00f4tiers</em> (small fishing boats) have brought in. There\u2019s a tiny, sandy beach there too.</p> <p>The bilingual French-Breton street signs make it feel very local and distinctive. The stone houses have slate roofs and the ambiance is part-riverbank, part-seaside. Towards the ocean and sand dunes, there are lots of protected natural areas, where very little building is allowed.</p> <p>On our last trip we put our dog in the bicycle basket and went riding behind the dunes to the places I used to go to as a boy. You can cycle to <strong>\u00cele-Tudy</strong> on the opposite headland, which has a huge white sand beach. Much further west (you need a car) is <strong>La Torche</strong>, which is famous for its tulips and for holding the world windsurfing championships (it\u2019s one of the best windsurf spots in France).</p> <p>Sainte-Marine has a fantastic hotel, the <strong><a href=\"http://www.trimen.fr/en/\" title=\"\">Villa Tri Men</a></strong> (doubles from \u20ac97-265 room-only,) so this year, for my birthday \u2013 a big one \u2013 we ate in the restaurant there, <a href=\"http://www.trimen.fr/en/the-restaurant/\" title=\"\">Les Trois Rochers</a>, and next morning took the <a href=\"https://www.vedettes-odet.com/en/\" title=\"\">boat out to the beautiful </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.vedettes-odet.com/en/\" title=\"\">Gl\u00e9nan islands</a></strong> from B\u00e9nodet (adult return \u20ac36).</p> <p>The whole area is perfect for puttering round in a boat.

      "bodyText": "Portugal: Ribatejo Silvia Bastos, 46, from Lisbon Every year we spend two weeks in our house in Ribatejo province, in a village called Moreiras Grandes, 12km south-west of the town of Tomar, central Portugal. The house belonged to my great-grandmother and I went there every summer as a child. Now I want my own children, aged 12 and nine, to have a connection to the land. We plant trees, pick grapes from our vines. They have a freedom there that they don\u2019t have in the city. Very few foreign visitors make it here and most Portuguese prefer to go to the beach, so it is very quiet. It\u2019s much greener than the Alentejo, to the south \u2013 people sometimes call Ribatejo the Tuscany of Portugal \u2013 and it\u2019s also cooler than the south. The nights are usually fresh. When we bring friends here they can\u2019t believe how beautiful it is. One of the best things to do is spend the day by the Z\u00eazere River or Castelo do Bode, a 66km-long lake formed in the 1950s when the river was dammed. In the past few years the lake has become more geared up for tourism and now there are places offering water sports, such as wake boarding at Lago Azul in the town of Ferreria do Z\u00eazere. An unexpected attraction is the famed dinosaur footprints at Pedreira do Galinha, 20km west of Tomar, discovered in 1994. Tomar itself is beautiful, with one of the best monuments in the country \u2013 the vast, Unesco-listed Convent of Christ, originally a 12th-century Templar stronghold. It\u2019s surrounded by castle walls and its various cloisters were built over several centuries, in different architectural styles. We usually eat at home because we have planted so many fruit trees and plants, as well as vines, and it\u2019s great to eat \u2013 and drink \u2013 what we grow, but in Tomar there\u2019s a fun medieval-themed restaurant, Taverna Antiqua, that serves traditional dishes, like boar with wild berries. Grelha do Z\u00eazere in Ferreria do Z\u00eazere is also great \u2013 it serves regional cuisine, especially grilled meat. Tomar and the river are jewels of Portugal, yet few people explore them. \u2022 Stay at Quinta da Anunciada (doubles \u20ac65-90), a historic country house with pool, 2km from Tomar Interview by Isabel Choat Czech Republic: Orlick\u00e9 mountains Ond\u0159ej Vach, 36, from Prague I spent my childhood holidays at my grandfather\u2019s cottage in the Orlick\u00e9 mountains, and though I have always lived in Prague, it\u2019s the place I consider my true home. The region, about a two-hour drive east of the capital, is attractive yet very humble, full of forests, cycle paths and nature reserves \u2013 and completely under the radar. There are no big hotels or expensive restaurants; it\u2019s a peripheral tourist area where Czechs walk or have fun in the wild river \u2013 and that\u2019s why I like it. I have been returning there with my wife, Jana, since I met her in 2012, and now that we have two small daughters \u2013 Jani\u010dka, aged three, and Kl\u00e1rka, three months \u2013 we head there for our family holiday each summer. The iconic symbol of Orlick\u00e9 is undoubtedly Masaryk\u2019s Chalet (Masarykova chata na \u0160erlicku), a three-storey green cottage built in the mid-1920s in honour of the first president of Czechoslovakia, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk. During the second world war it was seized and used as a place of recovery for injured Nazi pilots, then the communists occupied it until after the revolution in 1989. It\u2019s a fascinating site to walk to, with peaceful, unspoiled nature all around \u2013 and you can stay in lodge-style rooms for a good price, too (\u20ac14pp with breakfast). The Pastviny Dam (Vodn\u00ed n\u00e1dr\u017e Pastviny), on the Divok\u00e1 Orlice river, is another great place to visit, especially with kids. It\u2019s 6km long, and is the last stone-made dam in the Czech Republic. It\u2019s incredibly beautiful. My grandpa\u2019s cottage was in this valley, it\u2019s where I learned to swim. You can hire rowing or pedal boats, or just splash around in the clear water. A good base for exploring the region, and where we usually stay, is \u017damberk, known as the gateway to the Orlick\u00e9 mountains. It\u2019s a modest but pretty town with a rural atmosphere. There are two great restaurants \u2013 Imrvere, a very typical Czech restaurant, which does excellent roast duck with dumplings, and Kanec, which is also the local brewery pub. The name means wild boar, and I often head there for their strong, unfiltered lager and a plate of utopenec (pickled sausage). Oh, and do you know the British band Reef? Singer Gary Stringer and bassist Jack Bessant played at \u017damberk\u2019s JamRock festival a few years ago and were so impressed by the area they wrote a song called Road to \u017damberk \u2013 then came back and played the festival for free the following year! Interview by Mark Pickering Denmark: Helgen\u00e6s peninsula, Jutland Esben Thorup, 37, from Copenhagen Like many Danes, my grandfather bought a plot of land in the 1950s to build a summerhouse on. The Helgen\u00e6s peninsula is pretty rural \u2013 it\u2019s known locally as the \u201csnot drip\u201d of Jutland (there\u2019s a bump on the east coast that looks a little like a nose). It\u2019s so off the beaten track that most Danes have never even heard of it. There are lots of fields around and it\u2019s surprisingly hilly for Denmark. Some say it looks a little like Scotland. The house was built with two tiny bedrooms, one for my grandfather and grandmother and the other for my dad and my uncle to share, as well as a kitchen, a living room and a toilet. That was it \u2013 no bath, you just washed in the sea, 100 metres away. Because it\u2019s on the east coast, the water is calm and it\u2019s great for swimming. When I was small my family would spend three weeks here every summer. We swam, ate strawberries and ice-cream and the sun was always shining \u2013 at least that\u2019s how I remember it. It isn\u2019t fancy (although we did install an indoor shower in the 1990s) but I love it \u2013 my wife and I even got married here. We drive over from Copenhagen every summer with our three kids \u2013 aged one, four and seven \u2013 to spend time with my parents, my brothers and their families, and my uncle\u2019s family. My dad built another small house on the same plot to fit everyone in, but there\u2019s usually still someone sleeping on the sofa or the floor. Not a lot goes on here \u2013 but that\u2019s part of the attraction. To get to the house you have to go down an overgrown track, and there\u2019s hardly any phone signal. We spend our time swimming, talking, walking and barbecuing. There are a few local artists \u2013 potters and painters mainly \u2013 who sell work from their houses. You can go windsurfing and there\u2019s even an annual surf festival. There\u2019s also fishing, kitesurfing and paragliding \u2013 the steep slopes leading to the beach give great uplift for catching the wind. If we\u2019re ever in need of fancier attractions, we go to Ebletoft, an old port town 30 minutes\u2019 drive away with a population of around 7,000 (this is \u201cthe big town\u201d). There are a few visitor sites there, such as the glass museum, Glasmuseet Ebeltoft and Fregatten Jylland, which houses the world\u2019s longest wooden ship. It\u2019s also nice to just stroll around Ebeltoft\u2019s old streets; sometimes we\u2019ll get some craft beer from Ebeltoft brewery \u2013 they do a nice IPA. We eat pretty simply when at the summerhouse \u2013 we might pick up some salad leaves, new potatoes or fruit grown from the produce stands with honesty boxes dotted along the roads. And there\u2019s a small fishing hut at the top of the peninsula where a fisherman and his son smoke fish and sell great seafood. I wish I could tell you what it was called and how to get hold of them, but the hut doesn\u2019t even have a name, let alone a website. Just thinking about it brings back fond memories for me. Helgen\u00e6s is a special place that\u2019s tightly bound to my family. It feels like \u201chome\u201d. \u2022 Sol Og Strand (sologstrand.com) has a selection of holiday homes in Helgenn\u00e6s, starting at \u20ac302 a week in high season for a wooden cabin sleeping four Interview by Helen Russell Croatia: Premantura, Istria Daniel Dragojlovi\u0107, 35, from Zagreb At the end of the war in Croatia in 1995, my grandmother bought an old stone house in the village of Premantura, south of Pula. It was a safe area for my twin brother Davor and me to go, because it hadn\u2019t been affected by the war. A cousin of ours had bought a piece of land nearby and said, \u201cOh, you have to come and see this little town. It\u2019s magical.\u201d What\u2019s so special about this peninsula, Kamenjak, is that there is untouched nature and untouched beautiful beaches. It\u2019s the only part of Istria that has a proper Mediterranean climate \u2013 completely different from anything else. At the far end of the peninsula are 10 to and 15-metre-high cliffs that you can jump off. There are also caves, a lighthouse and, apparently, dinosaur footprints. When we were kids we found it fascinating. It still feels magical. You take your bike or walk, to find spots where you can be on your own and not see anyone. A favourite beach is Velika Kolombarica, whose cliffs are often featured in Croatian tourism ads. Just above it is the Safari Bar, which has a great story. This Croatian guy who used to work in Switzerland decided to live like Robinson Crusoe, so he made this bar out of practically nothing, just materials he found on the peninsula, or in the sea. We walk down to Kolombarica, jump off the cliff, go to a cave, and then go back to the bar for a drink. We usually cook at home but sometimes we\u2019ll go inland to villages that do truffles and homemade pasta. Istria is the land of truffles. In Banjole, up the coast towards Pula, there\u2019s a restaurant called Batelina where the chef creates dishes using types of fish and seafood that fishermen would normally throw away. It also does amazing pasta and bottarga (cured fish roe). Most of the accommodation in Premantura is private apartments and villas, but the recently opened Premantura Resort has a pool and doubles from \u20ac85-\u20ac175 B&amp;B. We come to Premantura every August with my parents and grandmother, and we still have friends we met here when we were young kids. Some of them live in Zagreb, some in other cities in Europe, but they all have houses in Premantura and now return every year with their own families. So these connections are still going strong. Interview by Mary Novakovich Hungary: Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za-S\u00f3st\u00f3f\u00fcrd\u0151 Gr\u00e9ta Klib\u00e1n, 38, from Budapest P\u00e9ter and I have been together for 10 years, and for almost all that time we have spent part of our summers in Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za-S\u00f3st\u00f3f\u00fcrd\u0151, eastern Hungary, a 2\u00bd-hour drive from Budapest. It is 60km from Debrecen, where P\u00e9ter grew up, so the area is especially nostalgic for him. We are fortunate to have a house here, built by P\u00e9ter\u2019s grandparents, which gives us a deep connection to the land. Though these days, even friends from Luxembourg and Belgium join us here because they love the relaxed vibe. The centrepiece is S\u00f3st\u00f3 Lake, which is surrounded by an oak forest for nice long walks. People come to bathe and run around the track. We like to take a paddle boat out on the water. Our six-year-old daughter and four-year-old son are fans of the Aquarius Experience and Park Bath, which has a wave pool, slides and thermal waters. They also like the massive Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za Zoo, where they always head to the Oceanarium first. Tourism has really started to blossom here in recent years, and now there are lovely homes to rent and charming hotels to stay in, like Aventinus (doubles from \u00a358). The upscale Hunguest Hotel S\u00f3st\u00f3 is opening this summer, and we are excited about checking it out. A bridge will connect it directly to Aquarius. Every day, the kids crave ice-cream, usually from the atmospheric Omnia gelateria at the bottom of an old water tower. We sometimes eat at Colorado Steakhouse, which has a kitsch American wild west feel, with lots of wood. For something lighter than steak and pulled pork, we\u2019ll eat alfresco at Italian restaurant La Terrazza, which has magical views of the lake. Afterwards, if we are lucky, there will be live music at Kr\u00fady Vigad\u00f3. This beautiful terrace is where everybody comes together to chat, drink, and savour summer evenings. Interview by Alia Akkam Spain: Guimer\u00e0, Catalonia Elisa Minguella, 43, from Barcelona Every August, I go with my husband and two daughters to Guimer\u00e0, a tiny medieval village on a hillside in a quiet, rural part of Catalonia. It\u2019s only 130km west of Barcelona but it feels a world away from the city and the crowded beach resorts. I\u2019ve been coming to Guimer\u00e0 for as long as I can remember. My great-grandfather was the mayor there, and my father was born in the house where we stay each summer. In the winter only a couple of hundred people live there but in the summer it\u2019s full of families, almost all of them with a connection to the village going back generations. When I was a child, I would spend the entire school summer holidays in Guimer\u00e0 with my brothers and my grandmother. I had complete freedom to stay out all day with my friends, and I encourage my girls to do the same now. They love the novelty of going to the bakery on their own to buy bread. In August, my whole family gathers in the village: my parents, my two brothers, uncles and my cousins with their families. It can get pretty crowded in the house, Cal Belleta. Every house in the village has a name and that\u2019s how we know which extended family people belong to. People ask: \u201cDe quina casa ets?\u201d (Which house are you from?) There aren\u2019t any hotels in Guimer\u00e0 but it\u2019s possible to rent a large house for far less than it would cost in more touristy places. Cal Caig (sleeps 11, on airbnb.com) for \u20ac120 a night; and Ca l\u2019Anxica (sleeps 12) with a private pool is \u20ac290 a night (for up to eight people) or \u20ac360 a night for up to 12. The best way to discover the local countryside is on foot via one of the many walking trails. My favourite goes along the river Corb, passing the ruins of Convent de Vallsanta. There are also many places in the area to enjoy traditional Catalan food \u2013 we go to Cal Feliuet in nearby Belltall, where we always order snails. The day out we love the most is at the medieval market of Guimer\u00e0, which is held on the second weekend of August (10-11 Aug 2019). Everyone from the village dresses up in medieval costumes and each street is dedicated to a traditional trade, such as glassmaking. At night we put on a play based on a story from the history of the village, followed by fireworks from the tower. For me, the best part of the event is the way everybody comes together to make it happen. It\u2019s that sense of community that will keep us coming back to Guimer\u00e0. Interview by Annette Pacey Italy: Capo Circeo, Lazio Federica Cannone, 42, from Rome My father has a house in Borgo Montenero, a small village 100km south of Rome in a pine wood surrounded by fields of watermelons and strawberries. The place is super quiet but there\u2019s a farmers\u2019 market every weekend, an excellent little pizzeria called La Pizza in Piazza, and a grocery store and post office. The charming coastal town of San Felice Circeo is 10 minutes\u2019 drive away, home to Spiaggia Capo Circeo beach, a sandy strip of stabilimenti balneari (quintessentially Italian beach clubs with rows of sunbeds and umbrellas). It gets fully booked in August, often by families who have been going for generations, so my husband and I go round the headland to Saporetti beach, right by Monte Circeo. Its restaurant, Ristorante Saporetti, is on the beach: I always go for the salad ni\u00e7oise and, in the evening, fantastic (if a tad pricey) fish dishes. We like coming here because we know pretty much everyone now, from other families to the lifeguard, Carmelo, who\u2019s been there for decades, and the owners of the stabilimento. The area is relatively unknown to foreign visitors, who tend to head further south to the Amalfi coast or stay much closer to Rome, in Ostia. It\u2019s a shame: Circeo is super-easy to get to (you can be here in just over 1\u00bd hours from Rome) and it really has some beautiful beaches and pristine water \u2013 the area has been awarded a blue flag for the past three years. There are plenty of places to stay: lots of agriturismi or B&amp;Bs. One of my favourites is Podere Bedin (doubles \u20ac75-110); the owners are friendly and the restaurant uses local products. The area is part of Circeo national park, which runs along the coast of Lazio, spanning forests, marshes, sand dunes, Lake Paola, the island of Zannone and stunning sand dunes. The Istituto Pangea Onlus offers trails and trekking excursions as part of its eco-educational programme, and there\u2019s also cave diving, lots of cycling routes, and kayaking. Water Life, a company owned by local B&amp;B Propriet\u00e1 Scalfati, (doubles from \u20ac140) is our go-to for kayaking trips. You can also get to Ponza, the largest island in the Pontine archipelago, in just an hour from the port of San Felice Circeo (boats depart everyday at around 10am). Circeo\u2019s food and drink are also a big draw. We always go to Cantina Sant\u2019Andrea, not far from Borgo Montenero, where you can fill your own wine bottle straight from huge casks. Aperitivos are cheap and well-done pretty much anywhere you go. We usually go to Saporetti\u2019s St Bar for an aperol spritz at sunset, and we really like Tiki and La Terrazza, too \u2013 both in the old town of San Felice Circeo. If we aren\u2019t eating at home, we tend to go to Il Grottino, which has branches in the old town and the port. It\u2019s the nicest trattoria, and their linguine all\u2019astice \u2013 with white wine, parsley, tomatoes, garlic and astice (small lobster) \u2013 is phenomenal. Locanda degli Artisti is quite popular too, and more experimental \u2013 they do things like ravioli cacio e pepe with black truffle and seafood; prawn tartare with pine nuts and orange reduction; and scallops on a mousse of mushrooms and sundried tomatoes. And Ristorante Antico Molino, by our house, specialises in buffalo meat and mozzarella. Interview by Marianna Cerini The Netherlands: South Limburg Majella van der Horst, 44, from Haarlem Whenever we ask our children (aged 11, seven and six) where they want to go on holiday, they always say, \u201cWe want to go to Oma\u2019s campsite,\u201d meaning Camping \u2019t Geuldal, a friendly campsite surrounded by fields and woods in hilly South Limburg, where their grandmother spends six months of the year in her caravan, and where my husband holidayed as a child in the 1960s. We live in Haarlem, near Amsterdam, and compared with the city, the beautiful Geuldal region is quiet and green. You can swim in the Geul River, cycle and take long walks. For a fun outing, we go to the town of Valkenburg, which has caves and the ruins of a 12th-century castle. There\u2019s also a chair lift from the valley station, just south of the town centre, up to a summer toboggan centre where you can rocket back down the hill through a metal half-pipe on a sort of sledge on wheels. Our kids love getting a milkshake and a slice of Limburgse vlaai (fruit tart) at Cup &amp; Vino in the town\u2019s historic centre, or having a pizza at La Casa, whose fries are served with the best mayo we\u2019ve tasted (they refuse to share the recipe). Most of our time, however, is spent on the campsite. We\u2019ve stayed there five years in a row, sometimes for up to six weeks, first in a rented chalet and now in our own caravan. All our stuff is there, so I just pack some clothes and off we go. The kids can be totally free and play outside all day or take part in on-site activities such as ball games, a mini-disco or caring for animals at the petting zoo. If the children are happy, we can relax too. I read, lie in the sun and work a bit on my laptop. As long as the kids still love it there, we\u2019ll keep on coming. \u2022 Camping \u2019t Geuldal is 10km from Maastricht; tent or motorhome pitches in high season \u20ac17-22 plus \u20ac3-4pp. Holiday homes around \u20ac600 a week high season, based on four sharing Interview by Deborah Nicholls-Lee France: Finist\u00e8re, Brittany Nicolas Tanguy, 50, from Nice I was born in Finist\u00e8re, the westernmost tip of mainland France, and loved telling people where I came from as it means the fin de terre \u2013 the end of the Earth! When I was a teenager I used to go cycling around on my own or meet my friends and we would explore the Odet river, riding past the giant blue and pink hydrangeas and on to Sainte-Marine, a tiny port on the opposite side of the estuary from B\u00e9nodet, which has since become a notable yachting centre. I left the end of the Earth to study and work in Paris, where I met my wife, who is Australian, and we\u2019ve travelled all over the place. Now we live in Nice, south-east France, and for 15 years I never thought about going back to Brittany, but then a few years ago my wife wanted to see where I was brought up. We went back to Sainte-Marine, sat under the giant white parasols of the Caf\u00e9 de la Cale on the waterfront and took le bac (the ferryboat) across to B\u00e9nodet for an ice-cream at Bankiz. It was just magical, so now we go back regularly. It\u2019s all about the simple pleasures. We always have the bl\u00e9 noir (buckwheat) cr\u00eape: a compl\u00e8te (ham, eggs and cheese) or a caramel au beurre sal\u00e9 from La Misaine. If we want seafood, we have a plate of langoustines \u2013 Sainte-Marine is the French capital of langoustines, which locals affectionately call demoiselles (maidens). The day\u2019s catch still comes in at 4pm, heralded by squawking seagulls, so we always go down to see what the c\u00f4tiers (small fishing boats) have brought in. There\u2019s a tiny, sandy beach there too. The bilingual French-Breton street signs make it feel very local and distinctive. The stone houses have slate roofs and the ambiance is part-riverbank, part-seaside. Towards the ocean and sand dunes, there are lots of protected natural areas, where very little building is allowed. On our last trip we put our dog in the bicycle basket and went riding behind the dunes to the places I used to go to as a boy. You can cycle to \u00cele-Tudy on the opposite headland, which has a huge white sand beach. Much further west (you need a car) is La Torche, which is famous for its tulips and for holding the world windsurfing championships (it\u2019s one of the best windsurf spots in France). Sainte-Marine has a fantastic hotel, the Villa Tri Men (doubles from \u20ac97-265 room-only,) so this year, for my birthday \u2013 a big one \u2013 we ate in the restaurant there, Les Trois Rochers, and next morning took the boat out to the beautiful Gl\u00e9nan islands from B\u00e9nodet (adult return \u20ac36). The whole area is perfect for puttering round in a boat. I\u2019m even thinking about taking my boat licence! Interview by Jon Bryant Germany: Lychen, Uckermark Bert Schulz, 45, from Berlin This summer will be the fourth year in a row that our family \u2013 my wife Claudia and my two daughters Rosa (nine) and Tilda (seven) \u2013 will spend our summer holiday in a beautiful place called Lychen, in the rural Uckermark region. It\u2019s little more than an hour\u2019s journey north of Berlin but feels like a world away. Unlike much of the rest of mostly flat Brandenburg state, it is quite hilly. Getting there from Berlin is very easy \u2013 we don\u2019t have a car so we take a train to F\u00fcrstenberg (one hour) and then ride our bikes 15km to Lychen. Every year we book one of two rental flats in a converted farmhouse called Hof Georgenhoehe (from \u20ac52-82 a night for two plus \u20ac9-13 each additional peron) a little outside the town. One apartment used to be pigsty and the other was a stable. The place we rent has two bedrooms, and a terrace looking out over the countryside that is lovely to sit on in the summer. The place still has a few farm animals (pigs, a couple of old Highland cows, chickens and a small flock of sheep) but these days they are kept as pets. In the morning the first thing the kids do is go and collect eggs from the chickens, then they\u2019ll feed the pigs, visit the farm cats and so on \u2013 it is a great way for children from the city to learn more about animals. We often go for a run in the mornings and there are several lakes nearby to swim in \u2013 our favourites are Grosser Lychensee, which is walking distance from the farmhouse, and we can cycle to Wurlsee and Rutenberger See. In the town of Lychen (population 3,000) there are a couple of decent German restaurants (Gasthof am Stadttor is our favourite) and bars (the Stadtkrug and the Gastst\u00e4tte zum Dicken) if we don\u2019t feel like cooking. A bit further away is a very good Japanese-style restaurant called Tenzo Gasthof, run by people who quit Berlin for life in the countryside. With kids this age, cycling is definitely the best way for us to enjoy the region, but others explore it by canoe or houseboat \u2013 the lakes in the area are all linked and you can sail around for weeks at a time.

For years, people have hoped that Mueller would swoop in like a \u201cdeus ex machina\u201d with blockbuster charges against the president. For years, it has also been obvious that this would not happen, and that defeating Trump would require the traditional hard work of political organizing. Now that Mueller has conclusively showed that the Russia investigation was a pitiful sideshow, perhaps Democrats can finally get back to the issues that Americans actually care about.</p> <p>It\u2019s embarrassing to recall just how absurdly some people elevated Mueller, and how much faith was placed in him.

How to make a summer hit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He may not be a household name in the UK, but 34-year-old J Balvin is arguably \u2013 statistically \u2013 one of the most successful musicians in the world right now. The Colombian is credited with the revival of reggaeton, with monthly streaming figures that currently surpass those of Drake, Justin Bieber and Cardi B. He is second only to the unstoppable Ed Sheeran. His recent release, Oasis \u2013 an ebullient eight-track joint album with Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny \u2013 was called \u201chistoric\u201d by both Fader and Vulture and \u201cgoofy but incredibly fun\u201d by Pitchfork. It clocked up 40m streams in one week. Granted, streaming can be a malleable metric, but across the board Balvin\u2019s numbers are phenomenal. \u201cThey made it official yesterday. I\u2019m [currently] the most viewed artist on the planet on YouTube,\u201d he says as we sit at a table shaped like a massive vulva.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPc3Pe42bGI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kPc3Pe42bGI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Four of his videos have surpassed 1bn views, putting him in the same league as Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.

In 2018, she invited Balvin on stage at Coachella. \u201cShe was super nice, she treats everyone with respect. The smaller you show yourself, the bigger people feel you, not the other way around.

Even when appearing on tracks by Pharrell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/apr/11/no-payne-no-gain-as-liam-flexes-his-muscles-with-his-new-a-list-friends\">Liam Payne</a> and Cardi B, Balvin sings in Spanish. Contrary to previous record industry rulebooks, this doesn\u2019t hold him back in the slightest. \u201cI want to be that guy to make Spanish music global so I\u2019m going to keep pushing it,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t sing in English because he doesn\u2019t need to, not these days. If the people want it, the people stream it.

There\u2019s one thing \u2013 being sad \u2013 which is emotional, the other thing is depression, which is a chemical thing in your brain. Depression is some different kind of monster that you cannot deal with if you don\u2019t have the right medication.\u201d People around him at the time didn\u2019t help; they couldn\u2019t understand why he was down when he seemed to have it all. \u201cYes, I have everything. Yes, I\u2019m depressed. It\u2019s not related and anyway it depends on what \u2018everything\u2019 is to you.\u201d</p> <p>He was reluctant to try therapy, assuming it was for \u201ccrazy\u201d people, so he explored a variety of holistic alternatives.

So when I had the depression, the last thing I did was go to the shrink.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the reason he is based in Sardinia is for his mental wellbeing. His current schedule can mean playing eight shows in eight countries over eight days; this week alone, he has played in Greece, Finland, Germany and Spain. But he now takes precautions to look after his health: he is still on medication, although things are not as intense. He does colouring books to relax and he doesn\u2019t drink, smoke or take drugs. He has a mentor, a wealthy older man whose daughter he once tried to date, who provides him solid spiritual guidance.

He also pulled out of a performance at Miss USA in 2015 after discovering Donald Trump part-owned the pageant. It was due to be his first ever US TV performance, but Balvin was outraged when the then presidential hopeful labelled illegal Mexican immigrants rapists, thieves and narcos. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy ethics, ethics are not negotiable,\u201d he insists. \u201cI used to work illegal[ly] in the US while I was trying to find my dream.

So when [Trump] said this I thought: \u2018He\u2019s crazy!\u2019\u201d He pauses momentarily. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s crazy or if he\u2019s actually smart.

He has a Nirvana tattoo on his knee. \u201cKurt, Tupac, Biggie \u2013 these are revolutionary guys,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I\u2019m touring Europe and I see how the youth are reckless and jumping around, I understood that\u2019s the revolution that Kurt was talking about.

We\u2019re all motivated to embrace our culture and give hope to the kids.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if he ever considers how his privilege has benefited him \u2013 both his upbringing and that he can pass as white \u2013 and if he has any thoughts on appropriation, given the music he makes is Panamanian in heritage. It is the one time during our conversation that he is short and suddenly becomes distracted by his phone \u2013 and, as a result, his answer is vague. \u201cA hundred per cent [I think about it].

A tortoise may have just urinated all over his Versace silk pyjama suit, yet the South American superstar singer remains serene. Perhaps, as he gazes at the Anish Kapoor sculpture, Balvin is thinking about how massively rich he is. The musician owns various houses around the world and has so many expensive watches that there is a YouTube video dedicated to rating his collection out of 10 (he scored a 7.5). His private jet \u2013 a $4m Dassault Falcon 2000, according to the internet \u2013 is currently idling in nearby Olbia airport, ready to whisk him to Ibiza tonight for a 90-minute show at Pacha, before dropping him back here, a multimillion-pound mansion in Sardinia. This house, which he is renting for the summer while he tours Europe, comes complete with devastatingly beautiful views of the eastern peninsula and art from Kapoor, Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons and Fernando Botero. His own Medell\u00edn home features art by his actual friends KAWS and Takashi Murakami.

Alongside Rosal\u00eda, Becky G, Bad Bunny, Maluma and Ozuna, Latino artists have proved that modern music transcends translation. \u201cBeing an artist in a conservative country, especially a place not known for reggaeton, coming from a tough place, it\u2019s always a risk to do this. But you know what I say,\u201d he grins, finally taking the tissue from Max to wipe up the wee. \u201cThe bigger the risk, the bigger the win.\u201d J Balvin and Bad Bunny\u2019s album Oasis is out now \u2022 This article was amended on 30 July 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly stated that J Balvin had grown up in Bogot\u00e1.",

Once it\u2019s fully emptied, I crawl into the dishwasher until the available light is blocked by my frame. The problem is unchanged: there is simply no mechanism for fixing the arm in place.</p> <p>\u201cI give up,\u201d I say, standing up and stomping across the garden to my office. I haven\u2019t actually given up; I just want to consult the internet. I discover the part in question is the middle spray arm, implying the existence of an upper spray arm I never knew about. I am otherwise unenlightened.</p> <p>Half an hour later I hear someone keening in frustration. It sounds like me.</p> <p>\u201cDad!\u201d the voice shouts.</p> <p>I return to the kitchen to find the middle one on the floor in front of the dishwasher. In my absence he has been charged with replacing the racks and dishes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this!\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say, kneeling. \u201cLine the wheels up on the tracks, and then lift.\u201d As we slide the upper rack into place, a little protrusion at the back engages with a slot in the spray arm, and my world turns upside down.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat if... ?\u201d I stare at the boy open-mouthed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, looking at me warily, as if I might be having a stroke.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if the spray arm attaches to the rack, rather than the dishwasher?\u201d I push the head of the spray arm into a corresponding gap in the rack, and hear a satisfying click.</p> <p>An hour later my wife walks into the kitchen carrying a collection of mugs retrieved from various bedrooms. I\u2019m frozen in contemplation, pestle in one hand, mortar in the other.</p> <p>\u201cBusy?\u201d she says, opening the dishwasher.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to increase amounts by a third in my head,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cWait, did you fix this thing?\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/06/tim-dowling-im-american-i-can-handle-a-heatwave-right\">Tim Dowling: I\u2019m American, I can handle a heatwave.

      "bodyText": "Just before midday I open the door to the youngest one\u2019s bedroom and peer into the gloom. \u201cWake up!\u201d I shout. \u201cIt\u2019s haircut day!\u201d \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d he shouts. \u201cKelly and Hayley are already here,\u201d I say. \u201cMum\u2019s highlights are under way.\u201d \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my hair cut, and your brother is in the chair,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201d \u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the talk is of Kelly\u2019s broken sewage pipe, but other topics will be covered.\u201d \u201cGo away,\u201d he says. I go back downstairs with a half-finished shopping list. \u201cThe council\u2019s saying there\u2019s nothing they can do,\u201d says Kelly, running clippers up the middle one\u2019s neck. \u201cShe\u2019s too nice, is what it is,\u201d says Hayley, indicating Kelly with the pointed handle of her colouring brush. \u201cWhat else goes on this list?\u201d I ask. \u201cSupper,\u201d my wife says. By the time I return from the shops, everyone is shorn and lunch has begun. I have no plans for the afternoon beyond finding a sunny spot where I can sit and worry. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this dishwasher,\u201d my wife says. \u201cThis bit is just hanging off.\u201d I crouch down and peer in. The bit she is referring to is the spray arm. I push it back into place a few times, to no avail. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to attach it to,\u201d I say. \u201cThere must be a piece missing.\u201d My wife begins to pull dirty dishes from the top rack, and I have a sense of my afternoon evaporating. Once it\u2019s fully emptied, I crawl into the dishwasher until the available light is blocked by my frame. The problem is unchanged: there is simply no mechanism for fixing the arm in place. \u201cI give up,\u201d I say, standing up and stomping across the garden to my office. I haven\u2019t actually given up; I just want to consult the internet. I discover the part in question is the middle spray arm, implying the existence of an upper spray arm I never knew about. I am otherwise unenlightened. Half an hour later I hear someone keening in frustration. It sounds like me. \u201cDad!\u201d the voice shouts. I return to the kitchen to find the middle one on the floor in front of the dishwasher. In my absence he has been charged with replacing the racks and dishes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this!\u201d he says. \u201cLook,\u201d I say, kneeling. \u201cLine the wheels up on the tracks, and then lift.\u201d As we slide the upper rack into place, a little protrusion at the back engages with a slot in the spray arm, and my world turns upside down. \u201cWait,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat if... ?\u201d I stare at the boy open-mouthed. \u201cWhat?\u201d he says, looking at me warily, as if I might be having a stroke. \u201cWhat if the spray arm attaches to the rack, rather than the dishwasher?\u201d I push the head of the spray arm into a corresponding gap in the rack, and hear a satisfying click. An hour later my wife walks into the kitchen carrying a collection of mugs retrieved from various bedrooms. I\u2019m frozen in contemplation, pestle in one hand, mortar in the other. \u201cBusy?\u201d she says, opening the dishwasher. \u201cI\u2019m trying to increase amounts by a third in my head,\u201d I say. \u201cWait, did you fix this thing?\u201d she says. \u201cOh yes,\u201d I say. \u201cFantastic,\u201d she says. \u201cThe spray arm attaches to the rack, not the dishwasher,\u201d I say. \u201cDo I need to hear this part?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my perspective on a lot of things,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you know about the upper spray arm?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this door,\u201d she says. I see that she is struggling to unlock one of the back double doors. After some tinkering I manage to force the top bolt down with a screwdriver, creating a new problem. \u201cNow it won\u2019t close,\u201d I say. \u201cLeave it then,\u201d my wife says. \u201cWon\u2019t close is worse than won\u2019t open,\u201d I say. \u201cI need a ladder.\u201d Two hours later I am still up the ladder, keening and swearing while our dinner guests look on.",

      "bodyText": "A Labour MP has written to the government\u2019s most senior official to warn about what he said was the potential for conflicts of interest in Boris Johnson\u2019s government if he implemented proposed policies that could potentially benefit major donors. Ian Murray \u2013 who does not allege any wrongdoing \u2013 told Sir Mark Sedwill that with the new government promising rapid change, \u201cit is particularly important that the public have confidence that decisions are being made in their interests and in the proper way\u201d. His letter pointed to a series of areas of potential focus, including proposed cuts to stamp duty when Johnson received donations of more than \u00a360,000 from property developers during the recent Conservative party leadership campaign. Murray, a supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, also noted Johnson\u2019s much-touted plans for free ports including Bristol, when the owners of Bristol port gave \u00a325,000 to his campaign; and policies to reform the NHS after he received \u00a310,000 from Richard Girling, a leading UK investor in the private healthcare system. The letter highlights one of the principles of the ministerial code, which guides the behaviour of those in government, saying ministers \u201cmust ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise\u201d. Murray wrote to Sedwill, the cabinet secretary: \u201cI am concerned that the following recent policy announcements made by the new prime minister could be perceived to give rise to conflicts of interest given financial interests he has registered with the House of Commons.\u201d Johnson has received a total of \u00a362,000 from various property developers and investors, including Jamie Reuben. As London mayor, Johnson faced criticism for approving a \u00a3100m development by the family firm co-run by Reuben\u2019s billionaire father, David. During the leadership campaign it was reported that Johnson planned to raise the threshold for paying stamp duty from \u00a3125,000 to \u00a3500,000, and cut the top rate \u2013 for any price paid above \u00a31.5m \u2013 from 12% to 7%, which would reduce the cost of high-end homes. Murray\u2019s letter also highlighted the appointment of Andrew Griffith, a senior Sky executive, after he lent Johnson his London home to use as an office during the leadership campaign. It also cited any possible moves to review taxes on high-sugar drinks or tobacco, given that Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign was headed for a period by Mark Fullbrook, who co-runs a firm that lobbies for both industries. Fullbrook is a partner in lobbyists Crosby Textor Fullbrook Partners (CTFP). The company has said he took leave of absence to head Johnson\u2019s campaign, and had no contact with the company\u2019s clients during this period. CTFP do not say who they work for in the UK, but emails seen by the Guardian show the company contacted councillors earlier this year on behalf of the tobacco giant Philip Morris to lobby over anti-smoking measures. Separately, it has emerged that the Australian part of the same lobbying group, Crosby Textor Research Strategies Results, acts for the dairy multinational Parmalat, which produces a major flavoured milk brand that contains more sugar than Coca-Cola. During the leadership campaign Johnson said he would reconsider a tax introduced last year on high-sugar drinks. Among his other tasks will be to follow up on a government consultation on new measures to curb tobacco use, including the possibility of cigarette firms being forced to pay for schemes. Murray wrote to Sedwill: \u201cThe surest way for the prime minister to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest on these issues is for him to now recuse himself from any discussion of policymaking on these topics. \u201cI would be very grateful if you could remind the prime minister of his obligations under the ministerial code, and encourage him to recuse himself in this way to maintain public confidence in the government\u2019s policymaking process.\u201d Downing Street was contacted for comment.",

On the contrary, he joked with the sellers that every time he visited, they had to leave him alone for five minutes, so he could stand in silence and enjoy the view. The company also disclosed the history to potential buyers, and if anyone were to ask him specifics about it, his plan was to say \u201cresearch LaBianca house\u201d and leave it at that. He said he had priced it just below market value, but that appraisers struggled to tell him whether the history would be a detractor since \u201cthere is not a bank of information on famous murder homes in LA\u201d. Bagans, whose purchase of the property is now in escrow, declined to say what his plans were for the property or if he intended to do any formal paranormal investigations once he took over. But, he added, \u201cIf I\u2019m spending time there and come into contact with anything, that\u2019s the world I live in\u201d. Criminology professor Fox said she was surprised the home hadn\u2019t been demolished: \u201cI could not imagine hanging a TV on the wall where [words] were written in someone else\u2019s blood.\u201d But, she added, \u201cwith real estate, you only have to have one buyer\u201d.",

There is no continuity in the leading ranks dealing with Brexit. Britain\u2019s chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, has been hounded out and the cabinet secretary has only managed to hang on by the skin of his teeth. Johnson has appointed a raft of Brexiteer special advisers but they cannot coordinate Whitehall, or go to Brussels to negotiate.</p> <p>Even more importantly, in the face of this anti-civil service crusade, who will prepare honest briefs for the prime minister? It is the duty of civil servants to tell truth to power, but who can blame those who remain if they pull their punches in the face of threats to their career? Johnson will go into the talks without a realistic map of the minefields, or an experienced adviser at his side.</p> <p>Second, when he gets into the room with his opposite numbers, the charm that has worked so well in the past on young women and his angry bosses is likely to wilt. He inspires no trust in his European counterparts and he has no allies.</p> <p>Brussels is making it clear he should go to capital cities first so he can be disarmed of his irrational exuberance. When he goes into Angela Merkel\u2019s office in the gleaming Kanzleramt in Berlin, she will listen politely to what he has to say, looking for anything new or any sign of room for him to wriggle out of the unwise promises he made to party members to get elected. She will want to find a way of avoiding a no-deal Brexit and will suggest ways of softening the backstop, but she will not get rid of it. Leo Varadkar in Dublin will be equally polite, but no amount of charm will persuade him to drop the backstop. He has already made it clear that, in his view, Johnson\u2019s \u201cconfidence and enthusiasm is not a substitute for a European policy\u201d.</p> <p>Third is the problem of logic, which does not bend to charm. The backstop has been agreed because if we leave the EU there will otherwise have to be a hard border in Ireland. It doesn\u2019t matter who builds it; either the UK does or the Irish will have to. Technology can make it possible for lorries to cross the border more quickly, but that isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is identity, which is at the root of the Good Friday agreement, and that is not solved by a faster border.</p> <p>The ruse of a \u201cstandstill\u201d deal, where Britain continues to enjoy all the benefits of the single market while being outside it \u2013 which Johnson has promoted on the campaign trail \u2013 will be immediately dismissed. In addition, Merkel will point out that the Canada-style free trade agreement he wants will necessitate a return to the original backstop, where Northern Ireland remains inside both the single market and the customs union, with a border in the Irish Sea. Furthermore, it will have to be permanent. A hard Brexit otherwise requires a hard border. That will be anathema to the DUP, on whose support he depends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-optimism-sales-pitch-only-disappoint\">Boris Johnson\u2019s optimism is a sales pitch that can only disappoint | Tim Lott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson has been theatrically critical of Theresa May\u2019s approach to Brexit, but he seems to be repeating exactly the same mistakes. He has made a series of contradictory promises to different people and his bluff is about to be called. As soon as he gets into the room with serious politicians they will confront him with the logic of his position and he will have no answers. Johnson\u2019s mixture of bluster and bullshit is fine in the public domain, but in the quiet of the airy office on the third floor of the German chancellery it will count for nothing.</p> <p>When Johnson returns empty-handed from his European tour he will \u2013 given his lack of a working parliamentary majority for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 face two choices. He can go either for a general election or a referendum. Although the latter would be the right choice for the country, it looks likely he will go for the former. The polls will show him that with the progressive vote split, with Labour down to 20% and the Lib Dems at 20%,, he could win a landslide in the first past the post system with an electoral understanding \u2013 even an informal one \u2013 with Nigel Farage. And he will know that if he waits too long into next year for an election, the recession will have begun to bite.</p> <p>For those of us who find it hard to stomach the idea of five years of a Johnson-Faragist government and the hardest of Brexits, the only possible way of stopping it is a coalition of progressive forces, from disenchanted moderate Tories to disgusted moderate Labour plus the Lib Dems and others, running on a common platform with the aim of forming a government of national unity.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Powell was Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff from 1995 to 2007</p>",

He inspires no trust in his European counterparts and he has no allies. Brussels is making it clear he should go to capital cities first so he can be disarmed of his irrational exuberance. When he goes into Angela Merkel\u2019s office in the gleaming Kanzleramt in Berlin, she will listen politely to what he has to say, looking for anything new or any sign of room for him to wriggle out of the unwise promises he made to party members to get elected. She will want to find a way of avoiding a no-deal Brexit and will suggest ways of softening the backstop, but she will not get rid of it. Leo Varadkar in Dublin will be equally polite, but no amount of charm will persuade him to drop the backstop. He has already made it clear that, in his view, Johnson\u2019s \u201cconfidence and enthusiasm is not a substitute for a European policy\u201d. Third is the problem of logic, which does not bend to charm. The backstop has been agreed because if we leave the EU there will otherwise have to be a hard border in Ireland. It doesn\u2019t matter who builds it; either the UK does or the Irish will have to. Technology can make it possible for lorries to cross the border more quickly, but that isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is identity, which is at the root of the Good Friday agreement, and that is not solved by a faster border. The ruse of a \u201cstandstill\u201d deal, where Britain continues to enjoy all the benefits of the single market while being outside it \u2013 which Johnson has promoted on the campaign trail \u2013 will be immediately dismissed. In addition, Merkel will point out that the Canada-style free trade agreement he wants will necessitate a return to the original backstop, where Northern Ireland remains inside both the single market and the customs union, with a border in the Irish Sea. Furthermore, it will have to be permanent. A hard Brexit otherwise requires a hard border. That will be anathema to the DUP, on whose support he depends. Johnson has been theatrically critical of Theresa May\u2019s approach to Brexit, but he seems to be repeating exactly the same mistakes. He has made a series of contradictory promises to different people and his bluff is about to be called. As soon as he gets into the room with serious politicians they will confront him with the logic of his position and he will have no answers. Johnson\u2019s mixture of bluster and bullshit is fine in the public domain, but in the quiet of the airy office on the third floor of the German chancellery it will count for nothing. When Johnson returns empty-handed from his European tour he will \u2013 given his lack of a working parliamentary majority for a no-deal Brexit \u2013 face two choices. He can go either for a general election or a referendum. Although the latter would be the right choice for the country, it looks likely he will go for the former. The polls will show him that with the progressive vote split, with Labour down to 20% and the Lib Dems at 20%,, he could win a landslide in the first past the post system with an electoral understanding \u2013 even an informal one \u2013 with Nigel Farage. And he will know that if he waits too long into next year for an election, the recession will have begun to bite. For those of us who find it hard to stomach the idea of five years of a Johnson-Faragist government and the hardest of Brexits, the only possible way of stopping it is a coalition of progressive forces, from disenchanted moderate Tories to disgusted moderate Labour plus the Lib Dems and others, running on a common platform with the aim of forming a government of national unity. \u2022 Jonathan Powell was Tony Blair\u2019s chief of staff from 1995 to 2007",

The separate discoveries of three bodies and burning cars have shaken rural northern British Columbia and rural Manitoba. During the investigation in British Columbia, police found Dyck\u2019s body roughly a mile from the first burned-out vehicle. That was about 300 miles from the spot along the Alaska Highway near Liard Hot Springs where Deese and Fowler were found, over a week ago. Fowler, the son of a chief inspector with the New South Wales police, was living in British Columbia and Deese was visiting him. Associated Press contributed to this report",

Although the country has a reputation for one of the world\u2019s best healthcare systems, the lack of general practitioners has reached crisis point. The problem is acute in rural areas where millions struggle to access care, but also in some of the low-income Paris <em>banlieues</em>.</p> \n<p>Half of all general practitioners in France are now aged over 60, and some work beyond retirement in order to keep practices open. Chenay is not alone in continuing into his 90s. Four years ago a 93-year-old doctor, Fran\u00e7ois Le Men, finally retired from his practice in rural Brittany, apologising his heart problems.</p> \n<p>Chenay began work as a general practitioner in this area of the Val-de-Marne almost 70 years ago. He has outstayed his own son, who also worked as a doctor but who retired at 67.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change,\u201d Chenay said. \u201cThe internet means more people now come in saying \u2018I\u2019ve looked it up online, I\u2019ve got such and such illness and need such and such treatment.\u2019 In reality they have no such thing and don\u2019t need that treatment at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he had been most struck by a rise in domestic violence. \u201cKnife crime against women by their partners seems to me to have got much more prevalent in the last couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cMen assume they can get away with it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93448bc9e7bc5dd0270b6a0b7ff2461a049039f3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93448bc9e7bc5dd0270b6a0b7ff2461a049039f3/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Chenay\u2019s practice is a few kilometres from central Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Chenay\u2019s practice is a few kilometres from central Paris.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Magali Delporte/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chenay, who says he wakes at 6.30am every day, sees patients on Mondays and Wednesdays and cares for members of a religious retirement home one afternoon a week. But he said the heavy administrative load of the French health system, as well as his continuing study of latest research, meant he worked around 60 hours a week.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s the only doctor in the area who accepts patients without appointments.

      "bodyText": "On a quiet street in a low-income Paris suburb, the doctor\u2019s waiting room was so full that patients spilled out on to the pavement. Some from distant housing estates had travelled here as early as 4am to be sure of a place in line. \u201cThis doctor is really loved because he takes time to listen to you, he calms you down,\u201d said Yamina Derni, 63, who had been treated for benign tumours. \u201cYou don\u2019t even notice his age.\u201d Christian Chenay, who celebrated his 98th birthday last month, is France\u2019s oldest practising doctor. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly give up work,\u201d he said in his small consulting room in Chevilly-Larue after treating his final patients of the day, an unwell toddler and a woman suffering from high blood pressure. \u201cHow can I stop when there are only three doctors in this area for a population of 19,000?\u201d he added. \u201cI keep going for my patients, particularly for the older ones, who I like to encourage. I love medicine. But I also like to keep active. If you stop working, you go downhill. At my age, if you spend your time watching TV and snoozing, you won\u2019t survive long.\u201d Chenay\u2019s decision to keep working is partly due to France\u2019s shortage of local family doctors. Although the country has a reputation for one of the world\u2019s best healthcare systems, the lack of general practitioners has reached crisis point. The problem is acute in rural areas where millions struggle to access care, but also in some of the low-income Paris banlieues. Half of all general practitioners in France are now aged over 60, and some work beyond retirement in order to keep practices open. Chenay is not alone in continuing into his 90s. Four years ago a 93-year-old doctor, Fran\u00e7ois Le Men, finally retired from his practice in rural Brittany, apologising his heart problems. Chenay began work as a general practitioner in this area of the Val-de-Marne almost 70 years ago. He has outstayed his own son, who also worked as a doctor but who retired at 67. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change,\u201d Chenay said. \u201cThe internet means more people now come in saying \u2018I\u2019ve looked it up online, I\u2019ve got such and such illness and need such and such treatment.\u2019 In reality they have no such thing and don\u2019t need that treatment at all.\u201d He said he had been most struck by a rise in domestic violence. \u201cKnife crime against women by their partners seems to me to have got much more prevalent in the last couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cMen assume they can get away with it.\u201d Chenay, who says he wakes at 6.30am every day, sees patients on Mondays and Wednesdays and cares for members of a religious retirement home one afternoon a week. But he said the heavy administrative load of the French health system, as well as his continuing study of latest research, meant he worked around 60 hours a week. He\u2019s the only doctor in the area who accepts patients without appointments. A sheet of paper and a pencil are fixed to the wall in the waiting room where people write their name on a first-come-first-served basis. Chenay believes that a large part of general practice work is looking beyond initial ailments and helping patients with underlying mental health issues. He said the low-income Paris suburbs were a \u201cforgotten place\u201d where unemployment affected mental health and undocumented migrants often survived on little. Chenay was born in 1921 in the western town of Angers and worked part-time as a welder to get through medical school. He walks with a cane due to a leg injury sustained while jumping from a train to escape forced labour during the Nazi occupation of France in the second world war. \u201cThe leg only really bothered me when I reached 80,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t wear glasses and he said his sight was excellent after a cataract operation. \u201cMy hearing is also good, certainly better than the 18-year-olds who wear earphones with the volume up,\u201d he added. Sarah Lahrouchi, 31, who has been a patient of Chenay\u2019s since she was born, said: \u201cHe\u2019s got an amazing memory and he takes time to investigate the why and how of what\u2019s wrong.\u201d In recent years he had supported her when she lost her premature baby son following a car crash during pregnancy. She said he had treated four generations of her family: her late grandmother, her parents, her siblings, and now her own children aged between three months and six years. Another patient, Leonor, 61, said: \u201cHe helped me after I had two miscarriages at a time when there was not much support for that.\u201d Life at the surgery has not always been easy. Chenay\u2019s late wife, Marthe, was repeatedly stabbed in an attack outside his consulting room several years ago. She survived but later succumbed to Alzheimer\u2019s. He and his current wife, Suzanne, whom he married at 91, have installed security cameras. Chenay said he had been lucky enough to know six patients aged over 100.

      "bodyText": "The Germans have a tendency to get naked. The Australians spend much of their time by the barbecue. And the Finns have gained a reputation for being too reticent \u2013 while also needing buckets of suncream. Love Island, the ITV dating show and cultural phenomenon that has become a fixture of the British summer, is spreading around the world, with broadcasters in 13 territories ranging from Hungary to New Zealand now making their own local version. But in the process of introducing each new country to the delights of watching a group of 20-somethings wearing swimwear attempting to couple up in a Mediterranean villa, the production team inevitably end up revealing something about each nation\u2019s personality. \u201cThere are definitely cultural differences around what is acceptable,\u201d said Mike Beale, managing director of ITV\u2019s Global creative network, who has helped to sell the format around the world. \u201cNudity is just not as big an issue in Germany and Denmark.\u201d The first overseas version of the show was in Germany, where Hei\u00dfe Flirts und wahre Liebe \u2013 \u201chot flirts and true love\u201d - has become a staple of the tabloid Bild\u2019s celebrity coverage and created a new group of Instagram influencers. TV critic Arno Orzessek of Germany\u2019s Radio 4 equivalent, Deutschlandfunk, went so far as to describe the show as part Goethe relationship drama and part \u201cpreserved fried sausage\u201d, urging German \u201ccultural snobs\u201d to give it a chance. In Scandinavia, where splitting groups into men and women and emphasising drinking can seem strange in countries with a more progressive approach to gender equality and restricted alcohol sales, editions of the show have a different tone. Finnish journalist Renaz Ebrahimi said part of the show\u2019s appeal is the insight it offers into relationships, \u201csince Finnish people are quite introverted\u201d. In the UK at least Love Island has proved to be a rare programme that could convince viewers aged 16-34 to tune in to live television at a specific time \u2013 an incredibly valuable advertising asset in an era when audiences are fragmenting. Beale is aware of the challenge of selling a television programme aimed at an audience who don\u2019t generally watch live television to middle-aged executives at traditional broadcasters. \u201cWhen we initially pitched this in America we sent episodes to the assistants of the executives we were going to pitch the show to \u2013 because it was the assistants who were going to watch the show,\u201d he said. ITV has had to counsel foreign TV executives that they might have to accept low television ratings for the initial series as an investment in the format. They are told that this will pay dividends if they follow the established playbook on making a show go viral on Instagram and YouTube. Local broadcasters are encouraged to put as much emphasis on viewers watching on catch-up and via the official app as on live broadcasts. One problem faced by the global spin-offs is that young audiences are increasingly bilingual and plugged into global conversations. Faced with a choice between watching reticent Scandinavians attempting to chat each other up and the full-blown glitz of a less-inhibited group of Britons, they might go for the latter. \u201cI chose to watch the English version because I saw people tweet about it and wanted to understand and because I love the English language,\u201d said a Irma, a 20-year-old student from Oslo.

I think two or three years ago we\u2019d be satisfied, and we\u2019re still not.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s a scary sentiment for England, that Australia\u2019s motivation remains so strong despite retaining the trophy. Partly the drive was to eliminate any chance of England tying the series on points, as happened in 2017. Partly it was prove a point of its own. \u201cIt was on my list to tick off a win here at Chelmsford,\u201d said Lanning. \u201cThere was a lot of talk about it being the Fortress, and England never losing here.\u201d Not any more.</p> <p>But the drive isn\u2019t just coming from the captain, though her record-breaking hundred will of course draw most of the eyes. In the first over of the match, gun opener Alyssa Healy had belted a pull shot for four before skewing a shot high for a catch at mid-on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2125d3630a372a18fd3003d25718ddd63c9b385\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2125d3630a372a18fd3003d25718ddd63c9b385/33_0_2745_1647/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Heather Knight is run out\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Heather Knight is run out.

She can time the ball when others can\u2019t and never allows the bowlers to settle down. Any other team losing her early might go quiet for a few overs. Beth Mooney, her opening partner, carved the second over for four boundaries.</p> <p>Anya Shrubsole may be England\u2019s premier seamer, but she was flayed through point, glanced to fine leg and met with a perfect on-drive for a dozen runs, before Mooney nicked a bonus through the vacant slips. In the fifth over, facing the other main bowler Katherine Brunt, Mooney shuffled across to play an audacious flip-pull over fine leg that bounced once before crossing the rope, clean out of the middle. She bookended the over with a square drive for four.</p> <p>Before Lanning had even started to hit out, Mooney had 29 from 16 balls and had her team going at nearly 10 an over. She provided the early momentum so that Lanning could fall in the slipstream, before pulling out to make a breakaway of her own. Mooney kept pace with a fifty from 28 balls, including some gorgeous straight drives for both four and six.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/26/england-australia-womens-ashes-t20-cricket-match-report\">Australia seal Women\u2019s Ashes triumph with record T20 defeat of England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Mooney fell for 53, it was Ash Gardner promoted up the order and coming to the party with a boombox and a plate of chicken wings. A mighty six from medium-pacer Nat Sciver, pulls and drives to the fence, and Gardner kept Lanning rolling with a rollicking 27 from 14 balls.</p> <p>Then to start the second innings, where England had bowled boundary balls in each of their early overs, Ellyse Perry started by hooping the ball outrageously away from the bat, starving Danni Wyatt of runs until the inevitable uncontrolled shot. Where England\u2019s early work in the field had been punctuated by errors, with Wyatt twice fumbling a single in the deep that became a boundary, Australia had Gardner sprinting off the fence at deep third to take an outstanding catch diving forward off Wyatt\u2019s outside edge.</p> <p>In every department, not just Lanning\u2019s department, Australia outstripped England by miles.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I\u2019ve got that extra gear,\u201d Lanning said later, but her team does too. T20 was supposed to be where England narrowed the gap, with more variables in the shortest form. On Friday the gap never looked broader, and Australia have never looked more determined to widen it.</p>",

I think two or three years ago we\u2019d be satisfied, and we\u2019re still not.\u201d That\u2019s a scary sentiment for England, that Australia\u2019s motivation remains so strong despite retaining the trophy. Partly the drive was to eliminate any chance of England tying the series on points, as happened in 2017. Partly it was prove a point of its own. \u201cIt was on my list to tick off a win here at Chelmsford,\u201d said Lanning. \u201cThere was a lot of talk about it being the Fortress, and England never losing here.\u201d Not any more. But the drive isn\u2019t just coming from the captain, though her record-breaking hundred will of course draw most of the eyes. In the first over of the match, gun opener Alyssa Healy had belted a pull shot for four before skewing a shot high for a catch at mid-on. Healy is the team\u2019s most attacking player, and has been delivering fast starts consistently through the tour. She can time the ball when others can\u2019t and never allows the bowlers to settle down. Any other team losing her early might go quiet for a few overs. Beth Mooney, her opening partner, carved the second over for four boundaries. Anya Shrubsole may be England\u2019s premier seamer, but she was flayed through point, glanced to fine leg and met with a perfect on-drive for a dozen runs, before Mooney nicked a bonus through the vacant slips. In the fifth over, facing the other main bowler Katherine Brunt, Mooney shuffled across to play an audacious flip-pull over fine leg that bounced once before crossing the rope, clean out of the middle. She bookended the over with a square drive for four. Before Lanning had even started to hit out, Mooney had 29 from 16 balls and had her team going at nearly 10 an over. She provided the early momentum so that Lanning could fall in the slipstream, before pulling out to make a breakaway of her own. Mooney kept pace with a fifty from 28 balls, including some gorgeous straight drives for both four and six. After Mooney fell for 53, it was Ash Gardner promoted up the order and coming to the party with a boombox and a plate of chicken wings. A mighty six from medium-pacer Nat Sciver, pulls and drives to the fence, and Gardner kept Lanning rolling with a rollicking 27 from 14 balls. Then to start the second innings, where England had bowled boundary balls in each of their early overs, Ellyse Perry started by hooping the ball outrageously away from the bat, starving Danni Wyatt of runs until the inevitable uncontrolled shot. Where England\u2019s early work in the field had been punctuated by errors, with Wyatt twice fumbling a single in the deep that became a boundary, Australia had Gardner sprinting off the fence at deep third to take an outstanding catch diving forward off Wyatt\u2019s outside edge. In every department, not just Lanning\u2019s department, Australia outstripped England by miles. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I\u2019ve got that extra gear,\u201d Lanning said later, but her team does too. T20 was supposed to be where England narrowed the gap, with more variables in the shortest form. On Friday the gap never looked broader, and Australia have never looked more determined to widen it.",

Trump ended the shutdown in February after Congress gave him approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding. But the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion he was seeking, and Trump then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.</p> <p>The money Trump identified includes $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture fund.</p> <p>The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration says will be used to construct more than 100 miles of fencing. One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for our live coverage today - thank you for following along! Some key links and events from today in politics: The Supreme Court has said the Trump administration can spend $2.5bn in Pentagon funds on the border wall. Trump announced Friday that Guatemala was signing an agreement to restrict asylum applications to the US, a move that immigrant rights advocates said was cruel and unlawful. A photo of a mother begging an armed Mexican guard to let her and her son cross the border went viral and became a symbol of migrants\u2019 struggles. The House judiciary committee is filing an application to seek access to grand jury evidence from the Mueller investigation, which lawmakers said they need to determine whether to begin impeachment proceedings. The justice department decided a major merger between T-Mobile and Sprint can move forward. Critics of the merger fear it could lead to higher prices for consumers and less innovation among wireless carriers. Four Democratic congress members have just published an op-ed explaining \u201cwhy we\u2019re moving forward with impeachment\u201d. Nancy Pelosi said she met with representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to \u201cclear the air\u201d. US economic growth slowed to 2.1% in the second quarter of 2019, a mediocre showing that Trump blamed on the Federal Reserve. The central bank is meeting next week and is widely expected to cut rates. Here are some more reactions to Trump\u2019s announcement today that Guatemala was signing an agreement to restrict asylum applications to the US. Amnesty International said that \u201cany attempts to force families and individuals fleeing their home countries to seek safety in Guatemala are outrageous\u201d, with Charanya Krishnaswami, the group\u2019s advocacy director for the Americas, adding: The Trump administration must abandon this cruel and illegal plan to shut doors to families and individuals trying to rebuild their lives in safety.\u201d From Racies, Texas-based group that provides legal services to refugee families: Congressman Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House committee on foreign affairs, said Trump\u2019s decision to sign the agreement was \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d, adding: Simply put, Guatemala is not a safe country for refugees and asylum seekers, as the law requires.\u201d Congresswoman Norma Torres: Read our full story here: Four Democratic congress members have just published an op-ed explaining \u201cwhy we\u2019re moving forward with impeachment\u201d: Here\u2019s an excerpt from the piece, co-authored by Mary Gay Scanlon, vice chair of the house judiciary committee; David Cicilline, representative from Rhode Island; Pramila Jayapal, representative from Washington; and Veronica Escobar, representative from Texas: Congress has patiently tried to work within traditional means to get to the bottom of this extraordinary situation. Committees have called witnesses and requested evidence, only to be stonewalled by Trump and his associates. The president\u2019s refusal to comply with the Constitution, statutes, and established congressional oversight defies the rule of law. Mueller\u2019s testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees was a watershed moment. At this point, it is up to Congress to act on the evidence of multiple counts of obstruction of justice committed by the president, and to continue our investigation into whether he has committed other high crimes and misdemeanors. Despite assertions to the contrary by the president and his allies, the special counsel\u2019s report and testimony are not the end of our investigations. We have now filed a petition in court to obtain the grand-jury documents referenced in the special counsel\u2019s report. In that filing, we have made clear that we will utilize our Article I powers to obtain the additional underlying evidence, as well as enforce subpoenas for key witness testimony, and broaden our investigations to include conflicts of interest and financial misconduct. While many people believe that beginning an impeachment investigation can begin only with a vote of the full House of Representatives, this is not true. Article I authorizes the House Judiciary Committee to begin this process. The president is celebrating the supreme court\u2019s decision to allow him to spend $2.5bn on the border wall: Immigrant rights\u2019 groups had argued that the spending would be unlawful, cruel and a waste of money: The American Civil Liberties Union had argued in court that the Trump administration \u201clacks authority to spend taxpayer funds on a wall that Congress considered and denied\u201d. Judge Haywood S Gilliam Jr of US district court in Oakland had previously blocked the effort. Gilliam wrote: The case is not about whether the challenged border barrier construction plan is wise or unwise. It is not about whether the plan is the right or wrong policy response to existing conditions at the southern border of the United States. Instead, this case presents strict legal questions regarding whether the proposed plan for funding border barrier construction exceeds the executive branch\u2019s lawful authority.\u201d Some more background on the case and Trump\u2019s funding proposal, via the AP: The case the Supreme Court ruled on began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. Trump ended the shutdown in February after Congress gave him approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding. But the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion he was seeking, and Trump then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall. The money Trump identified includes $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture fund. The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration says will be used to construct more than 100 miles of fencing. One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona are smaller. The Supreme Court has said the Trump administration can spend $2.5bn in Pentagon funds on the border wall: It was a divided decision, saying the White House could begin using some of the federal funds for border wall construction that had previously been contested: Some more breakdown of the justices\u2019 positions: Here is some additional impeachment commentary from Democratic representatives on the judiciary committee. Veronica Escobar said: Yes, we\u2019re crossing a threshold with this filing. And we are now officially entering into an examination of whether or not to recommend the articles of impeachment.\u201d Jamie Raskin: From my personal point of view, we are in an impeachment inquiry. Eric Swalwell: This is an impeachment investigation. More here: Donald Trump is now blaming Barack Obama for the air conditioning system in the West Wing, which he said is either \u201cfreezing or hot\u201d: Hello and happy Friday! Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our coverage for the rest of the day. The president is continuing to threaten to tax French wines, noting that he thinks American wines look better: I\u2019ve always liked American wines better than French wines. Even though I don\u2019t drink wine. I just like the way they look. A reminder about what the Trump Winery brand has to offer: That\u2019s it from me this week. Sam Levin will be taking things over on the West Coast for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where things stand so far today. House Democrats took a step closer to impeachment by filing a petition to gain access to the underlying grand jury material from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. Democrats on the judiciary committee said in their request that they needed the information to determine whether to recommend filing articles of impeachment against Donald Trump. But Nancy Pelosi said in her press conference today that Democrats would only launch impeachment proceedings \u201cwhen we have the best possible case.\u201d The House speaker emphasized that she was \u201cnot trying to run out the clock\u201d on impeachment, but she added, \u201cWe will proceed when we have what we need to proceed. Not one day sooner.\u201d The White House announced Guatemala has signed on to the so-called safe third country agreement that could limit asylum applications to the US. Earlier this week, Trump threatened the country with tariffs and a \u201cBAN\u201d if it didn\u2019t agree to the deal. US economic growth slowed to 2.1% in the second quarter of 2019, a mediocre showing that Trump blamed on the Federal Reserve. The central bank is meeting next week and is widely expected to cut rates. The justice department decided a major merger between T-Mobile and Sprint can move forward. Critics of the merger fear it could lead to higher prices for consumers and less innovation among wireless carriers. Thanks for following our coverage this week and have a great weekend. Trump said he hoped the asylum agreement with Guatemala would \u201cend widespread abuse of the system and the crippling crisis on our border\u201d, according to the pool report. He was also optimistic that his administration would be able to sign more third country agreements, which he said would help to put \u201ccoyotes and the smugglers out of business. These are bad people.\u201d The president added that the agreement would send a message to smugglers: \u201cyour day is over.\u201d The House judiciary committee has officially filed its petition seeking the underlying grand jury material from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The committee\u2019s chairman, Democrat Jerry Nadler, said at a press conference earlier today that the panel needed the information to reach a decision on whether to recommend impeachment. \u201cThe House must have access to all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full \u2026 powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity: recommendation of articles of impeachment,\u201d Nadler said, reading from the court petition. But the top Republican on the panel, Doug Collins, has slammed the move. \u201cJudiciary Democrats are suing for grand jury material to which they have no right,\u201d Collins said in a statement. \u201cChairman Nadler\u2019s legal action here is sure to fail, weakening Congress\u2019s ability to conduct oversight now and into the future.\u201c The White House announced that the US and Guatemala have reached an agreement on limiting asylum applications. The news came three days after Trump threatened Guatemala with tariffs, among other sanctions, if it did not sign on to the so-called safe third country agreement. Reuters reports: Speaking to reporters at the White House during a signing ceremony, Trump said the agreement would allow easier access to farmer workers for U.S. farms and ranches. Guatemala\u2019s President Jimmy Morales was due to sign a deal with Trump last week that would have made the country act as an asylum buffer zone to reduce immigration to the United States. But the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled he could not sign such an agreement without prior approval from Congress, which is on a summer recess. In response, Trump threatened Guatemala in a tweet on Tuesday. \u2018Now we are looking at the \u2018BAN,\u2019 Tariffs, Remittance Fees, or all of the above. Guatemala has not been good,\u2019 Trump wrote. Two Democratic presidential candidates are going after each other on Twitter using ... penguin gifs? It all started when tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang said he would attack Michael Bennet at the next debate for reasons ... that are not entirely clear. The Colorado senator responded by suggesting that Yang\u2019s ire may stem from a poor grade in high school math: It then escalated to the penguin gifs: In any event, the CNN moderators at next week\u2019s debate in Detroit probably won\u2019t pay too much attention to the potential drama, given that both Yang and Bennet are polling between about 1 and 3 percent. Trump has been hitting on the Federal Reserve again. After today\u2019s meh report on the US economy Trump has called the Fed an \u201canchor wrapped around our neck,\u201d on Twitter. The Fed meets next week and is widely expected to cut rates, just as Trump has repeatedly asked it to do. But if the now 10-year long economic recovery does start to slow, as it appears to be doing, you can expect yet more attacks on the central bank in the months to come. The creator of that fake presidential seal has a message for the Turning Point USA staffer who caused it to appear behind Trump onstage during the conservative group\u2019s event: \u201cI love them\u201d. Charles Leazott, a former Republican and graphic designer, said whoever chose the doctored seal resembling the Russian coat of arms was \u201ceither wildly incompetent or the best troll ever. Either way, I love them.\u201d But Leazott, who voted for George W Bush twice, said he didn\u2019t believe Turning Point USA\u2019s claim that the error was the result of an audiovisual aide\u2019s rushed Google search. \u201cYou have to look for this,\u201d Leazott told the Washington Post of the seal, which he created as a form of comic protest. \u201cThere\u2019s no way this was an accident, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d Trump is pressing the World Trade Organization to change how it defines developing countries, claiming that the current classification gives China an unfair advantage. The president signed a memo today urging his administration to find ways to force the WTO to reconsider its view, the Wall Street Journal reports. \u201cWhen the wealthiest economies claim developing-country status, they harm not only other developed economies but also economies that truly require special and differential treatment,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cChina most dramatically illustrates the point.\u201d But the memo names other countries that Trump thinks should be reevaluated \u2013 including Turkey, Mexico and Qatar. Another House Republican, Martha Roby of Alabama, has decided to retire from the chamber. The news comes on the heels of two other Republicans \u2013 Pete Olson of Texas and Paul Mitchell of Michigan \u2013 announcing their own retirements this week. The string of announcements has been music to the ears of Democratic strategists, who say they show that Republicans are fearful of losing their seats next year. Olson\u2019s district has particularly caught the attention of national Democrats, given that he won last year by just 4 points. And Roby\u2019s departure also means the House Republican caucus\u2019 number of women members will sink even lower, as a National Journal editor noted: The conservative youth organization Turning Point USA apologized to Trump for having him appear at the group\u2019s event this week in front of a doctored presidential seal. During the group\u2019s Teen Student Action Summit, Trump stood on stage in front of a presidential seal that had been altered to resemble the Russian coat of arms, with a two-headed eagle clutching a set of golf clubs in its talons. The group has reportedly fired the audiovisual aide responsible for the mistake, which was blamed on a haphazard Google search. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign ribbed Trump after the president complained about a poll showing him losing in a potential match-up against the former vice president. Trump initially slammed Fox News for even discussing the network\u2019s latest poll, which found Biden leading Trump by 10 points, 49 percent to 39 percent, in a hypothetical face-off. And a Twitter account for Biden\u2019s campaign quickly jumped to action to throw salt in the wound: The Commerce Department released data today robbing Trump of one of his favorite talking points on the economy. The department revised data on US gross domestic production (GDP) back to 2014. According to the newly released data, economic growth last year was 2.5 percent. But Trump has frequently bragged about the economy growing 3 percent last year. The data also showed that US economic growth slowed to 2.1 percent in the second quarter of 2019, a decline that Trump unsurprisingly blamed on the Federal Reserve. But the revised 2018 data is likely connected to the news about slowing growth, economists noted. \u201cThat\u2019s half a percentage point less momentum in the economy than we thought before,\u201d Ben Herzon, an economist for the firm Macroeconomic Advisers, told the New York Times. \u201cWe had been expecting Q2 to be the beginning of the downshift, but it looks like it started before.\u201d Trump weighed in on tech again Friday morning, in a series of tweets that touched on some of the major issues confronting the industry today: trade, taxes and national security. The first statement was an apparent reference to Facebook investor Peter Thiel\u2019s recent allegation \u2013 for which he provided zero evidence \u2013 that Google has been \u201cinfiltrated\u201d by Chinese intelligence agents. Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury security, rejected the allegation on Thursday, telling CNBC that he and the president \u201cdid diligence on this issue\u201d and found no basis for concern. But Trump, who has frequently used Google as a political punching back, walked that statement back this morning. Google has denied working with the Chinese military. Next in Trump\u2019s crosshairs was Apple, which is reportedly planning to move production of its new Mac Pro computer to China, according to the Wall Street Journal. And then there was \u2026 France? The European nation\u2019s plan to take a bite out of tech giants\u2019 profits with a digital services tax has touched off a war of words between the two allies, with the US threatening legal action and now, it appears possible, \u201csubstantial reciprocal action\u201d against French wine imports. Presidential candidate Tom Steyer is pitching a \u201cjustice-centered climate plan\u201d as one of his first policy rollouts. Steyer, Democratic megadonor and philanthropist from California, would aim for net-zero warming pollution by 2045, five years earlier than most other Democratic candidates who have outlined plans. He envisions creating 1 million jobs through a civilian climate corps. And he would helps fossil fuel communities transition to new economies, investing $50 billion in them. He would also dedicate $2 trillion in federal funding over ten years to infrastructure. Other Democrats have proposed higher levels of spending. Many say they would fight environmental racism. New Jersey senator Cory Booker\u2019s environment plan is largely justice-focused. Steyer was campaigning for Trump\u2019s impeachment before he entered the race. As the fate of his presidency hangs in the balance, Trump is focusing on an issue that keeps many Americans up at night: the alleged inferiority of French wine. With that, at least one reporter selflessly offered to fact-check Trump\u2019s claims about American wine versus French wine. I\u2019m sure the president will appreciate the help given that he doesn\u2019t drink \u2013 raising doubts about his expertise on the matter. Several Capitol Hill reporters note that House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler seemed to be arguing that his panel has effectively already launched an impeachment inquiry. From a New York Times reporter: And when another New York Times reporter raised this issue during Nadler\u2019s press conference, Democratic representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee appeared to agree with him: But a HuffPost reporter strongly pushed back against that notion: It\u2019s worth noting that House judiciary committee Democrats said Nancy Pelosi has approved the language about impeachment in the new lawsuit seeking grand jury material from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. That request makes clear that the committee is considering articles of impeachment against Trump and that the grand jury information will help them reach a decision on the matter. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler quoted the new petition as telling a federal judge, \u201cBecause Department of Justice policies will not allow prosecution of a sitting president, the United States House of Representatives is the only institution of the federal government that can now hold President Trump accountable for these actions.\u201d Specifically referencing the part of the Constitution giving Congress the power to impeach a president, the request reads, \u201cTo do so, the House must have access to all the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise all its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity \u2014 recommendation of articles of impeachment.\u201d It\u2019s already 1 p.m. in Washington. Here\u2019s where things stand today. Nancy Pelosi said she was \u201cnot trying to run out the clock\u201d on impeaching Trump. \u201cWe will proceed when we have what we need to proceed. Not one day sooner,\u201d the House speaker said at her press conference. But, but, but: House judiciary committee Jerry Nadler said his panel is filing a new lawsuit to gain access to the grand jury information underlying special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. And that request argues the committee needs the information to render a judgement on whether to recommend articles of impeachment. Despite that request, Nadler declined to publicly endorse an impeachment inquiry, even though many reports indicate he has done so privately. US economic growth slowed in the second quarter of 2019, but the decline was less than many economists expected. There is sure to be more fallout this afternoon from Pelosi and Nadler\u2019s comments on impeachment. Stay tuned. The House judiciary committee\u2019s new lawsuit to get the grand jury information from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation argues that the panel needs the information to make a determination on recommending articles of impeachment against Trump. A CNN reporter noted the lawsuit\u2019s language specifically invokes the impeachment question. \u201cWe are not running away from articles of impeachment,\u201d representative Sheila Jackson Lee said. Chairman Jerry Nadler also noted that the panel expected to file another lawsuit to enforce its subpoena of former White House counsel Don McGahn. Some had expected House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler to use today\u2019s press conference to come out in favor of launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Many reports have indicated that Nadler has privately voiced support for launching an inquiry, but he has declined to do so publicly. When asked by a CNN reporter why he has chosen not to do so, Nadler notably paused before dodging the question. One of the panel\u2019s other members, representative Mary Gay Scanlon, then took the microphone to argue that impeachment \u201cisn\u2019t a binary thing that you either are or you aren\u2019t\u201d. Asked about divisions between his panel and Nancy Pelosi, Nadler downplayed any conflict between the committee and the House speaker. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there are real divisions with the speaker,\u201d Nadler said, pointing to Pelosi\u2019s comments during her press conference that Democrats \u201cwill proceed when we have what we need to proceed.\u201d House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler announced his panel would file an application today seeking the grand jury material underlying special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. Another House Democrat, Annie Kuster of New Hampshire, has announced her support of launching an impeachment inquiry. Kuster was first elected in 2012 and is, according to a Politico reporter, the 100th lawmaker to support an impeachment inquiry. Migrants at the southern border are expressing fear to immigration judges about being forced to return to Mexico as their asylum claims are processed. Our colleague Adam Gabbatt reports from El Paso, Texas: Judge Sunita Mahtabfar, presiding over the El Paso immigration court in south-west Texas, kicked off the hearing by asking the 16 asylum seekers a question. \u2018Is anyone here afraid to return to Mexico?\u2019 she said. There was a chorus of \u2018S\u00ed\u2019, at least from the adults. Three of the four children in court dozed, slumped against their parents on the unforgiving wooden benches. They had been up for hours, having been summoned to a meeting point in Ju\u00e1rez at 4.30am. ... Most of the 16 people in court had made the long, frequently dangerous, journey from their homes in Central America, hoping to live in the United States. But upon arriving at the US-Mexico border, and attempting to apply for asylum, they had instead been ordered back across the Rio Grande River that forms the border here, to Ju\u00e1rez \u2013 one of the most dangerous cities in the world. Nancy Pelosi recapped her meeting with representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez while downplaying any differences between her and the progressive congresswoman. When asked whether the meeting helped the pair bury the hatchet, the House speaker replied, \u201cI would never even say that it was a hatchet.\u201d Noting that Ocasio-Cortez is \u201ca very gracious member of Congress,\u201d Pelosi said the two of them had \u201ca very positive conversation about our districts and how we represent them.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re in a family,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIn a family, you have your differences, but you\u2019re still a family.\u201d When a reporter noted that sometimes her family has meetings to \u201cclear the air,\u201d Pelosi laughed along with the other journalists. \u201cWe just had a meeting to clear the air,\u201d the speaker said. The meeting between Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez came after weeks of escalating tensions between the moderate and progressive wings of the House Democratic caucus. At one point, Ocasio-Cortez said the \u201csingling out\u201d of her and three other minority congresswomen, known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d was \u201coutright disrespectful.\u201d Nancy Pelosi denied during her press conference that she was tying to run out the clock on impeachment, as some pro-impeachment Democrats have privately implied. \u201cLet\u2019s get sophisticated about this, okay?\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cWe will proceed when we have what we need to proceed. Not one day sooner.\u201d The House speaker emphasized that she was committed to moving forward with investigating Trump in a \u201cdetermined, positive way\u201d. \u201cTheir advocacy for impeachment only gives me leverage,\u201d Pelosi said of the members of her caucus advocating for launching an inquiry. She argued that Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony had \u201cconfirmed in the public mind that the president has obstructed justice\u201d. But given that Mueller was unable to investigate certain elements of the case, including Trump\u2019s finances, the speaker said she was committed to continuing their investigations of the president. \u201cAnd that is what we are doing in the courts.\u201d She added she would reconsider proceeding with an impeachment inquiry \u201cwhen we have the best possible case\u201d. Nancy Pelosi opened her press conference by lauding the budget deal the House passed yesterday and then slamming Senate Republicans for refusing to take up bills aimed at strengthening US election security. Pelosi repeated special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony that Russian election interference continues \u201cas we sit here\u201d. She then accused Republicans of turning a blind eye to election security deficiencies. She said Republicans were communicating there was \u201cno need to protect\u201d American democracy. But she pledged that Democrats would continue to \u201clegislate, investigate and litigate\u201d on election security, as well as \u201cother issues that Mr. Mueller testified to.\u201d A senior Border Patrol official claimed during a House judiciary committee hearing yesterday that Francisco Erwin Galicia, a Dallas-born US citizen who was detained by immigration officers for more than three weeks, never presented himself as an American citizen. But that claim from Brian Hastings contradicts the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s own records about Galicia\u2019s case. The Dallas Morning News, whose reporting helped secure Galicia\u2019s release, has more: Galicia is a Dallas-born U.S. citizen who lives in Edinburg in Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley. He also says he has dual citizenship in Mexico. The story of his 26 days in detention after being picked up by the Border Patrol in Falfurrias garnered widespread national attention after The Dallas Morning News first reported it on Monday. ... Galicia was released less than 24 hours after The News broke the story. [Representative Ted] Lieu, citing The News\u2019 reporting in which Galicia said that he lost 26 pounds in 23 days and wasn\u2019t allowed a shower during that time, asked Hastings if he could explain why Galicia was detained. Hastings replied that at the Falfurrias checkpoint where Galicia and his younger brother Marlon Galicia were taken into custody, Francisco \u2018claimed to be a Mexican National who was born in Reynosa, Mexico.\u2019 ... But Claudia Galan, Galicia\u2019s attorney, produced for The News a notice to appear that DHS issued to Francisco that reads: \u2018On or about June 27, 2019, you were found at the Falfurrias, Texas, Border Patrol Checkpoint, a distance of more than 25 miles from the United States border with Mexico ... You did not receive the permission of an immigration officer to proceed beyond that 25 mile limit ... At that time, you falsely represented yourself to be a citizen of the United States for the purpose of furthering your entry into the United States.\u2019 Galan said Galicia told authorities that he is a U.S. citizen from the moment he was detained at the Falfurrias checkpoint. Elizabeth Warren announced that her presidential campaign has received its one millionth donation. The Massachusetts Democrat posted a video of her calling Caitlyn, the person whose contribution pushed the campaign across the threshold. In the video, Caitlyn describes her job teaching English as a second language and how that work has made her very passionate about immigration and education reform. \u201cAll those things are close to my heart,\u201d Warren tells Caitlyn. \u201cAnd these are all the thing we\u2019ve got to work on.\u201d Watch the video below. It\u2019s either feast or famine with climate change forums for the Democratic presidential primary. After the Democratic National Committee refused to hold a climate-specific debate, two separate events will now be held for the 2020 Democrats to discuss the issue. Our colleague Maanvi Singh reported for yesterday\u2019s live blog: A Climate Forum on September 19 and 20 will be open to 2020 presidential candidates from both parties. The event will be hosted by Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, in partnership with MSNBC and environmental news outlet Our Daily Planet. CNN will also be holding a Democratic town hall focused on the climate crisis a few days earlier, on September 4. ... DNC Chair Tom Perez has forbidden an official debate centered on climate change (though \u2018forums\u2019 or a \u2018town halls\u2019 are be allowed), arguing that such a debate would favor candidates like Washington governor Jay Inslee, whose entire campaign is built around environmental issues. MSNBC host Ali Velshi announced this morning that he and Chris Hayes would moderate the two-day forum. But CNN is enforcing a polling requirement for its town hall, and so far, some candidates who have released climate plans (including Inslee and Kirsten Gillibrand) have not met the threshold. Menawhile, environmental activists are encouraging the networks to examine the ways in which climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities. A former longtime official at the Environmental Protection Agency tweeted this about CNN\u2019s town hall: The Commerce Department announced that US economic growth slowed in the second quarter of 2019. Our colleague Dominic Rushe reports: But the decline was less than expected \u2013 thanks to a consumer spending spree \u2013 and the report showed signs that there is continuing momentum in the US\u2019s decade-long economic expansion. US gross domestic production (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 grew at an annual rate of 2.1% in the second quarter, the three-month period between April and June. The figure is a marked slowdown in the 3.1% growth that the US achieved in the first three months of the year and comes as other major economies have warned that their growth is slowing, too. But economists had been expecting economic activity to have slowed to below 2% over the last quarter as the US\u2019s ongoing trade disputes with its largest trading partners took their toll and businesses cut back on investments. Five more House Democrats have announced their support of launching impeachment proceedings against Trump since Robert Mueller testified. Perhaps most notably, representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts joined the effort yesterday. The announcement makes Clark, the vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, the highest-ranking Democrat to support impeachment. But pro-impeachment Democrats had hoped that Mueller\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill would spark a stampede of support for their cause. That has not materialized, perhaps to the relief of Nancy Pelosi. The House speaker has not come around to the idea of impeachment, instead encouraging her caucus to continue investigating Trump and see where the evidence leads. With the House now adjourned for a historically long recess, pro-impeachment Democrats worry about losing momentum for their cause. But the six weeks they spend back in their home districts could give them a sense of where their constituents stand on impeachment. They\u2019ll likely either come back deflated or energized. Good morning, live blog readers \u2013 and happy Friday! Senate Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider bills aimed at improving US election security is looking worse by the minute. Since special counsel Robert Mueller testified that Russian election interference is happening \u201cas we sit here\u201d, Mitch McConnell and members of his caucus have twice rejected legislation to beef up election security. And now the first volume of a report from the Senate intelligence committee has documented, in detail, how Russia coordinated \u201can unprecedented level of activity against state election infrastructure\u201d during the 2016 election. According to the report, Russian cyberactors targeted all 50 US states and \u201cwere in a position to delete or change voter data\u201d in Illinois\u2019 voter database, although the committee found no evidence that they did so. The damning findings could put more pressure on McConnell to advance one of the several bills Democrats have proposed. But even if Congress could pass a bill, many are skeptical that Donald Trump would sign it \u2013 after he has spent nearly three years downplaying the effect of Russian interference. He could view the legislation as a swipe at the legitimacy of his 2016 election victory. But the writing is on the wall: this will happen again in 2020. The only question is whether America will be prepared for it. Here are some other things the blog is keeping its eye on: Nancy Pelosi will hold a press conference at 10.45am EDT. She will almost certainly be asked about where her caucus stands on impeachment, as roughly 100 Democrats have come out in favor of launching an inquiry. Pelosi will also meet with representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after weeks of sparring between the moderate and progressive wings of the House Democratic caucus. The House has adjourned for a historically long recess after passing the budget deal negotiated between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The chamber will not return until 9 September. That\u2019s all still to come on this beautiful Friday in Washington. Stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "An expert who gave the go-ahead for a company owned by Angus Taylor to spray pesticide on fields containing critically endangered grasslands wrote a report for NSW Farmers Association about how the environmental listing of the same species was impeding agriculture. Stuart Burge, a board member of the Local Land Services South East, conducted the paddock assessment for the company Jam Land, in which energy minister Angus Taylor has an interest, in 2016 just before it was sprayed. The incident in late 2016 has led to an investigation by the federal department of the environment under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act into whether Jam Land has illegally cleared land. Now the NSW Farmers Association\u2019s concerns are being used by the government to stave off a push for a Senate inquiry into Taylor\u2019s controversial meetings with bureaucrats about the grasslands listing. The government has given a crossbench senator, Rex Patrick, a letter written by the NSW Farmers Association as evidence of constituent concerns about the listing. It refers to problems with the listing that were identified by Burge \u2013 who had been employed by the Taylors \u2013 and echoes the arguments the Taylors have raised in fending off a possible prosecution. It is understood Patrick balked at voting for the inquiry this week because he was told the letter from the NSWFA provided evidence that there were genuine constituent concerns about the grassland protections. Previously the Guardian has revealed that a day after Jam Land met environment department officials to discuss the alleged illegal clearing, Taylor asked staff of then environment minister Josh Frydenberg to set up a meeting with bureaucrats responsible for the grasslands listing.

Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said it was \u201cincumbent on all senators to ensure that basic parliamentary and ministerial standards are upheld and to get to the bottom of this murky matter\u201d. \u201cThe minister [Taylor] now oversees the department that is investigating the alleged poisoning, on land that he part owns,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Morrison government has attempted to cover up the matters involving Taylor, by shutting down the establishment of a Senate inquiry to look into these issues and shutting down debate in the House of Representatives about these serious allegations.\u201d The report by Burge for the NSW Farmers, done after the investigation into the Taylors\u2019 land clearing began, found that \u201cthere was a concerning lack of communication and engagement with farmers whose land harbours the majority of high conservation value grassland\u201d and that \u201cthe greatest risk to the preservation of the Natural Temperate Grassland of the South Eastern Highlands ecological community is invasion of perennial grass weeds such as Serrated Tussock, African Lovegrass and Chilean Needlegrass\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump announced Friday that Guatemala was signing an agreement to restrict asylum applications to the US, a move that immigrant rights advocates said was cruel and unlawful. The so-called \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement would require migrants, including Salvadorans and Hondurans, who cross into Guatemala on their way to the US to apply for protections in Guatemala instead of at the US border. It\u2019s not yet clear how the agreement would take effect. Guatemala\u2019s constitutional court has granted three injunctions blocking its government from entering into a deal without approval of the country\u2019s congress. The announcement came after a court in California blocked Trump\u2019s most restrictive asylum effort to date \u2013 one that would have, in effect, ended protections at the southern border. Human rights groups condemned the latest move on Friday, with Amnesty International saying that \u201cany attempts to force families and individuals fleeing their home countries to seek safety in Guatemala are outrageous\u201d. \u201cThe Trump administration must abandon this cruel and illegal plan to shut doors to families and individuals trying to rebuild their lives in safety,\u201d said Charanya Krishnaswami, the group\u2019s advocacy director for the Americas. Raices, a Texas-based group that provides legal services to immigrant and refugee families, said the plan would put people\u2019s lives at risk and that the third country agreement \u201cviolates the principle of asylum and directly leads to people being kidnapped, beaten and sexually abused\u201d. The two countries had been negotiating such an agreement for months, and Trump threatened Wednesday to place tariffs or other consequences on Guatemala if it didn\u2019t reach a deal. Guatemala\u2019s government put out a short Spanish-language statement on Twitter that did not call the agreement \u201cthird safe country\u201d but \u201cCooperation Agreement for the Assessment of Protection Requests\u201d. The Guatemalan government said that in the coming days its labor ministry \u201cwill start issuing work visas in the agriculture industry, which will allow Guatemalans to travel legally to the United States, to avoid being victims of criminal organizations, to work temporarily and then return to Guatemala, which will strengthen family unity\u201d. The US president claimed it was a \u201clandmark agreement\u201d that would \u201cput the coyotes and smugglers out of business\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is a very big day. We have long been working with Guatemala and now we can do it the right way.\u201d Democrats criticized the decision on Friday. Congresswoman Norma Torres said \u201cthe Guatemalan government has chosen to defy the will of its own people to curry favor with the Trump administration\u201d and called the move an \u201can insult to common sense\u201d. Congressman Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House committee on foreign affairs, said Trump\u2019s decision to sign the agreement was \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d, adding: \u201cSimply put, Guatemala is not a safe country for refugees and asylum seekers, as the law requires.\u201d Department of Homeland Security officials said they expected the agreement to be ratified in Guatemala and would begin implementing it sometime in August. Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary, said it was part of a long-standing effort with Guatemala to address migration and combat smuggling. \u201cIt\u2019s risky to label an entire country as unsafe. We often paint Central America with a very broad brush,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are obviously places in Guatemala and in the US that are dangerous, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have a full and fair process. That\u2019s what the statute is focused on. It doesn\u2019t mean safety from all risks.\u201d Some noted that the US state department\u2019s own advisory on Guatemala says that \u201cviolent crime, such as armed robbery and murder, is common\u201d and that \u201cGang activity, such as extortion, violent street crime, and narcotics trafficking, is widespread\u201d. Guatemalans accounted for 34% of border patrol arrests on the Mexican border from October to June, more than any other nationality. Hondurans were second at 30%, followed by Mexicans at 18% and Salvadorans at 10%. Out of 259 asylum applications that Guatemala received last year, not a single application was approved, according to the Washington Post. Trump was asked if he expected to reach similar agreements with Honduras and El Salvador. He replied, \u201cI do indeed.\u201d",

Most people in the west have not heard of Uighurs or Xinjiang \u2013 a very remote part of China \u2013 and awareness of their plight has not been championed by a figure well-known in the west, as the Tibetan situation was by the Dalai Lama. Then there is the difficulty in getting information out of Xinjiang. China has restricted access to foreign journalists, other than those taken on bizarre propaganda tours, so reporters have largely been left to rely on accounts of escapees and the diaspora as well as satellite imagery to try to piece together what is going on there. \u201cThe informational warfare that\u2019s occurring at present \u2026 gives cover to governments or allows governments not to respond because they will say: \u2018We don\u2019t really know what\u2019s happening\u2019,\u201d says Leibold. China has exacted severe retribution against those who have spoken out, including Abdusalam\u2019s wife who, since the Four Corners broadcast, has been taken in by police almost every day and questioned for three or four hours. \u201cThey have been telling her to tell me to keep my mouth shut,\u201d says Abdusalam. \u201cShe\u2019s really frightened.\u201d \u201cNo one wants to talk, with good reason,\u201d says Leibold. \u2018Slow-burning act of cultural genocide\u2019 China has also walked a \u201cvery deliberate and very careful\u201d line in committing serious human rights abuses without perpetrating the sort of physical violence that might attract widespread global condemnation, says Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cI think part of the reason this is under the radar is that people aren\u2019t overtly being killed or raped or tortured.\u201d Despite this, Pearson says what China is doing in Xinjiang is \u201cabsolutely terrifying\u201d. \u201cThey are blueprinting a way of eradicating Muslim identity from a population and I think that\u2019s something we should all be quite scared about. \u201cWe spend so much time and energy on this religious freedom debate in Australia; well here\u2019s a group of people that are about to be exterminated in terms of their religion,\u201d says Pearson. Leibold says a \u201csubtle, unarticulated bias against Islam\u201d may also go some way to explain why the \u201cslow-burning act of cultural genocide\u201d in Xinjiang has not gained traction in western countries. \u201cMuslims unfortunately have very little sympathy globally at the moment. There is this spectre of Islamophobia globally that sits behind this issue,\u201d says Leibold. Turkel believes things have shifted in recent months. In Washington DC, where he is based, there is momentum for legislation enforcing targeted sanctions at senior Chinese officials. But Australia could do more, he says. \u201cI would like to see the Australian government be a little more steady and outspoken,\u201d he says, particularly in light of the Australian children, including Abdusalam\u2019s, who are trapped in Xinjiang, unable to return home to their Australian parents. \u201cIt should keep Australian politicians awake at night.\u201d",
